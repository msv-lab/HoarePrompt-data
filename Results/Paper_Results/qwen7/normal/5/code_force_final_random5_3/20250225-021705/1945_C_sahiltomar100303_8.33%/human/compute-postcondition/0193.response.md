State: **`leftZero` remains unchanged, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `tleftZero` remains unchanged, `tleftOne` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `mid` is defined, `n` is defined, `i` must be less than or equal to `n` and greater than `mid`**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop starts with `i` ranging from `mid` to `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `mid <= i < n` must be true.
3. Since `i` is the variable being iterated over in the loop, it must start at `mid` and increment until it reaches `n`.
4. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` must be initialized to `mid` and should be incremented within the loop body to eventually reach `n`.
5. The variables `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution, so they remain unchanged.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is initialized to `mid` and the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n` but greater than `mid`.
