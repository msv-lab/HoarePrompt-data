Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is explicitly given as 0.
- `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2` is true, but this condition does not directly affect the value of `left`.

The `print(left)` statement will simply print the value of the variable `left`, which is explicitly stated to be 0.

Output: **0**
