Postcondition: `left` is an integer greater than 0. If the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is `left - 1` and `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` is still greater than 0 and equal to `left - 1`, and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0', so `rightOne` is increased by 1.
