Output State: **`right` is less than `n` and incremented by 1; `tleftZero` is less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\) and increased by 1; `trightOne` is less than \((n - \text{right} + 1) // 2)**.

The value of `tleftZero` is increased by 1, while the conditions involving `right`, `n`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged.
