Postcondition: `left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is either (`leftZero` - 1) if the character at position `left - 1` in the string `s` is '0', or remains unchanged if it is not '0', `rightOne` is increased by 1 if the character at position `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0', and `rightZero` is increased by 1 if the character at position `left - 1` in the string `s` is '0'.
