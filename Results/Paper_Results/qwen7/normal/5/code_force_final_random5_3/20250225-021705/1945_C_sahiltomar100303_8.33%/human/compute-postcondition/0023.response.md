Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `mid`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `mid` is greater than 0
   - If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `leftOne` is 2.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 1) must still be less than `mid`. Therefore, `mid` must remain greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `mid` must remain greater than 1.

6. **Postconditions for the next iteration**:
   - If `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` will be updated based on the value of `s[1]`.
   - Otherwise, `leftOne` will be updated based on the value of `s[1]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is greater than 1, if `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is updated accordingly, otherwise `leftOne` is updated accordingly**.
