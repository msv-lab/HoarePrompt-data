Output State: **`leftZero` remains unchanged, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `tleftZero` remains unchanged, `tleftOne` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `mid` is defined, `n` is defined, `i` is greater than `mid` and less than or equal to `n`, `rightOne` is 2 more than its original value, and `s[i]` is not equal to '0'**.

Explanation: The variable `trightOne` is incremented by 1, making `rightOne` one more than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
