Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `rightZero` is increased by `(n - mid)`, and `trightZero` is also increased by `(n - mid)`. Similarly, `rightOne` is increased by `(n - mid)`, and `trightOne` is also increased by `(n - mid)`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = mid` to `i = n-1`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. For each character in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, if it is '0', `rightZero` and `trightZero` are incremented by 1; otherwise, `rightOne` and `trightOne` are incremented by 1. Since the loop runs for `(n - mid)` times, both `rightZero` and `trightZero` will be incremented by `(n - mid)`, and similarly for `rightOne` and `trightOne`.**
