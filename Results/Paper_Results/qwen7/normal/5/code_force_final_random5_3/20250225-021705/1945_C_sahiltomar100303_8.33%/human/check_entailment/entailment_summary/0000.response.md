Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size `n` and the binary string `s`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes counters for zeros and ones on both sides of the potential split point (`mid`).

3. **First Half Calculation**: It correctly counts the number of zeros and ones in the first half of the string up to the midpoint.

4. **Second Half Calculation**: It also correctly counts the number of zeros and ones in the second half of the string from the midpoint to the end.

5. **Adjustment Process**: 
   - The program attempts to adjust the left boundary to find the optimal split point where at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - Similarly, it adjusts the right boundary to find another potential split point.
   - This adjustment process ensures that the conditions for satisfaction are met for both sides.

6. **Decision Making**:
   - The program compares the distances of the potential split points from the center (`(n + 1) // 2`) and selects the one that is closest.
   - In case of ties, it prefers the split point with fewer zeros, which aligns with the requirement to maximize satisfaction on each side.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as splitting before the first house or after the last house.
   - It also considers the scenario where the entire village is on one side and ensures the correct split point is chosen.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and correctly implements the logic to find the optimal split point.

Correctness: **True**
