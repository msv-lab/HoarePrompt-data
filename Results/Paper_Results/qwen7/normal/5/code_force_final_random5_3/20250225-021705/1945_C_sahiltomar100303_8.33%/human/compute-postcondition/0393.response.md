Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must satisfy `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` must satisfy `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`, and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `leftOne -= 1` decreases the value of `leftOne` by 1. The conditions for `left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `leftOne` by 1 while maintaining the original conditions for `left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne`.
