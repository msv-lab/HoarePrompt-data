Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder for the loop index) and the variable `t` (which is used as the range limit).

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since the loop runs `t` times, `t` must be a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: The initial state given is that `t` is an input integer, where \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\). For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the given condition \(1 \leq t\).

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted is to ensure that `t` is within the specified range and greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0**
