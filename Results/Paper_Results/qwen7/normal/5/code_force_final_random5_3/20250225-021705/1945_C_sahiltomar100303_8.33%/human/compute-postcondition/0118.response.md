Postcondition: `right` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n`. Either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` still holds true. If `s[right] == '0'`, then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1.
