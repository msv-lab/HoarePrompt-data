Output State: **`right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\), `trightZero` is equal to \((\text{right} + 1) // 2 - 1\), and `trightOne` is less than \((n - \text{right} + 1) // 2\)**.

Explanation: The value of `tleftZero` is increased by 1 in the initial state, but the code only affects `trightZero`. The value of `trightZero` is decreased by 1. Since `trightZero` was initially less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\), after decrementing by 1, its new value is \((\text{right} + 1) // 2 - 1\). All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
