Output State: **`trightOne` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0**

The code sets `trightOne` to 0, which initializes it to a specific value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
