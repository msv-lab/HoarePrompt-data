Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is greater than 0, and the first character of `s` is not '0'; `leftOne` is 2.**

The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. Given that `leftOne` was initially 1, after executing this line, `leftOne` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
