Postcondition: **`leftZero` remains unchanged, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `tleftZero` remains unchanged, `tleftOne` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `mid` is defined, `n` is defined. If `s[i]` is '0' and `i` is 0 (initially), then `rightZero` is 2 and `trightZero` is 1. If `s[i]` is not '0' or `i` is 1 (after the initial check), then `rightOne` is 2 more than its original value.**

This postcondition summarizes the changes in the variables after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts.
