Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(mid)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values for These Variables**:
   - `i` should start from 0 because `range(mid)` generates values from 0 to `mid-1`.
   - `mid` is already given as `n // 2`, so no adjustment is needed for `mid`.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `mid` must be at least 1 (since `range(0)` would generate no values). Given that `mid` is `n // 2`, we need to ensure `n` is at least 2.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be 0.
   - `mid` is `n // 2`, but we need to ensure `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
