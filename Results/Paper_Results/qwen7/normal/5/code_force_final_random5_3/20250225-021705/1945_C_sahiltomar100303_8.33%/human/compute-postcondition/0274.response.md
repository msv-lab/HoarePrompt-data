Output State: **`right` is less than `n` and incremented by 1; `tleftZero` is less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\); `tleftOne` is equal to \((\text{right} + 1) // 2 + 1\); `trightOne` is equal to \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\)**.

Explanation: The line `trightOne -= 1` decrements the value of `trightOne` by 1. Since `trightOne` was initially equal to \((\text{right} + 1) // 2 + 1\), after decrementing, it becomes \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
