Output State: **`left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than `left // 2 - 1`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 2) // 2`**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially less than `left // 2`, after decrementing by 1, it will now be less than `left // 2 - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
