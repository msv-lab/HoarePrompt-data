Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is greater than 1, `leftZero` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes that `leftZero` has been increased by 1.
