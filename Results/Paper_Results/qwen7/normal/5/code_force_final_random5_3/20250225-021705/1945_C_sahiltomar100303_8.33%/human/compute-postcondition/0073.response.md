Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2` or `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, respectively, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is now `mid-1` and must be greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1', and `leftOne` remains unchanged if `s[left - 1]` is '0'. The number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]` still satisfies the conditions specified in the precondition.**

Explanation: The line `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was previously set to `mid`, it is now `mid - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
