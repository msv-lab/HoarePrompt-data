Output State: All variables remain unchanged except `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne`. After the loop executes all iterations, `rightZero` will be equal to the number of '0's in the substring from index `mid` to `n-1`, multiplied by 2, plus the initial value of `rightZero` if any. Similarly, `rightOne` will be equal to the number of '1's in the same substring, multiplied by 2, plus the initial value of `rightOne` if any. `trightZero` will be equal to the number of '0's in the substring from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `trightOne` will be equal to the number of '1's in the same substring.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all iterations, `rightZero` and `rightOne` will reflect the total counts of '0's and '1's in the substring starting from `mid` to the end of the string `s`, each count being doubled due to the loop incrementing them twice per iteration. `trightZero` and `trightOne` will hold the counts of '0's and '1's respectively in the same substring but without the doubling effect.
