Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop starts from `i = mid` and goes up to `n-1`. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `mid - 1`.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the range.
   - If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `s[i]` is not '0' and `rightOne` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i = mid` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` should be `mid`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.
   - The conditions for `rightZero` and `rightOne` depend on the value of `s[mid]`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be `mid` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `rightZero` and `rightOne` will be updated based on the value of `s[mid]`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `mid`, `n` is the upper limit of the range, if `s[mid]` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1, otherwise `rightOne` is increased by 1**.
