Output State: **`leftZero` is `left - 1`, and the character at index `leftZero` in the string `s` is '0'.**

Explanation: The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1, making it `left - 1`. Since the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` was originally '0', it remains '0' after the decrement. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
