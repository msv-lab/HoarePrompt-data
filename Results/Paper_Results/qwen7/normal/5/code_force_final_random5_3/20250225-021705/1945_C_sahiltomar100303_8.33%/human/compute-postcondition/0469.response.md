Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`, `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`, `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`, `right` is `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - 1 - (n - 1) // 2) // 2`, and `trightZero` is adjusted based on the following conditions: if the if part is executed, `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` and `trightZero` remains the same as before. If the else part is executed, `trightZero` is reduced by 3 if the third character added to `right` was '0', or remains unchanged if it was '1'. If `right` equals `n`, the adjustment to `trightZero` follows the original rules; otherwise, `tleftZero` remains unchanged if the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2`, or increases beyond `(n - 1) // 2` otherwise.**
