Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is a positive integer, `leftZero` is 4, `leftOne` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Given the initial state where `leftZero` is 3, after executing the code, `tleftZero` becomes 4. The values of `i`, `mid`, and `leftOne` remain unchanged. The condition regarding `leftZero` being 2 if the first character of `s` is '0' does not affect the value of `tleftZero` since `tleftZero` is a different variable.
