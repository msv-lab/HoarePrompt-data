Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is a positive integer, the current value of `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is incremented by 1. Initially, `leftZero` was not specified, but since it's being incremented, we assume it started from 0. After executing `leftZero += 1`, `leftZero` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
