Output State: **`i` is `mid`, `n` is the upper limit of the range, `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

In this code snippet, `rightZero` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `s[mid]` remain unchanged from their initial state. Since `s[mid]` was checked previously to determine whether `rightZero` or `rightOne` should be incremented, the only change is that `rightZero` has been increased by 1.
