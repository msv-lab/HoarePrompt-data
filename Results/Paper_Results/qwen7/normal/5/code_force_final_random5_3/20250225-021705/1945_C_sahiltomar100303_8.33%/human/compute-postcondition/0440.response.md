Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is 0.
- `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`.
- `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`.
- `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`.
- `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`.
- `right` is not `n`.
- `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - 1 - (n - 1) // 2) // 2`.
- `trightZero` is `trightZero - 3` (if `s[mid + 2]` was '0') or remains `trightZero` (if `s[mid + 2]` was '1').

The value of `right` is not specified directly but is dependent on other variables. Given the constraints, let's analyze the possible values:

1. `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`.
2. `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`.

Given these, `right` could be calculated as:
- If `leftZero` is 0, then `rightZero` is `n` and `rightOne` is `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`.
- If `leftZero` is `n//2`, then `rightZero` is `n - n//2 = n//2` and `rightOne` is `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`.

In both cases, `right` would be the sum of `rightZero` and `rightOne`.

However, since the exact value of `right` is not specified and depends on the specific values of `leftZero` and `rightOne`, we need to consider the general form.

Given the constraints, the value of `right` is the sum of `rightZero` and `rightOne`, which are derived from `n` and the specific conditions provided.

Output: **right (where right is the sum of rightZero and rightOne, with rightZero being n - leftZero and rightOne being either n//2 or n//2 + 1)**
