Postcondition: `left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` is either (`leftZero` - 1) if the character at `s[left - 1]` is '0', or remains the same if the character is not '0', `rightOne` is increased by 1, and `rightZero` is either (`rightZero` + 1) if the character at `s[left - 1]` is '0', or remains the same if the character is not '0'.
