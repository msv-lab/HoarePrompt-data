Output State: **`left` is `left - 1`, `leftZero` must satisfy `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` and can either be `leftZero - 1` or remain the same, `rightOne` must satisfy `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` and can either be `rightOne + 1` or remain the same, `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left - 1] == '0'`, and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1` if `s[left - 1] != '0'`**.

Explanation: The variable `left` is decremented by 1. The conditions and constraints on `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, and `leftOne` remain the same, but now they are based on the new value of `left`. Specifically, `leftZero` must satisfy `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` must satisfy `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left] == '0'` (since `left` was decremented), and `leftOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[left] != '0'`.
