Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `x` will be the last input integer received during any iteration of the loop, and `a` will be the last input integer received during any iteration of the loop. The list `big` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was 1 during the corresponding iteration, the list `less` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was 2 during the corresponding iteration, and the list `no` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2 during the corresponding iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `iterable2` will hold the value `innerLoop - 1`. The variable `x` will hold the value of the last integer received during any iteration of the loop, and `a` will hold the value of the last integer received during any iteration of the loop. The list `big` will contain all integers `a` for which `x` was 1 during the corresponding iteration, the list `less` will contain all integers `a` for which `x` was 2 during the corresponding iteration, and the list `no` will contain all integers `a` for which `x` was neither 1 nor 2 during the corresponding iteration.
