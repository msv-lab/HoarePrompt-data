Output State: **`max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is `max(big) + 2`, `num` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or modified by the `break` statement, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
