The function processes a series of constraints defined by pairs of integers (a, x). It categorizes these integers into three lists based on the value of x: `big` for x=1, `less` for x=2, and `no` for other values. After processing all constraints, it finds the smallest integer within the range between the maximum value in `big` and the minimum value in `less` that is not present in the `no` list. If such an integer exists, it prints it; otherwise, it prints 0.
