You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `iterable` will be equal to `loop`, `innerLoop` will be the value received as input for the last iteration of the outer loop, `x` will be the last input integer received during any iteration of the loop, and `a` will be the last input integer received during any iteration of the loop. The list `big` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was 1 during the corresponding iteration, the list `less` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was 2 during the corresponding iteration, and the list `no` will contain all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2 during the corresponding iteration. The variable `num` will either be the smallest integer between the maximum of `big` and the minimum of `less` that is not in `no`, or it will remain 0 if no such integer exists.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `num` will hold the smallest integer within the specified range (between the maximum of `big` and the minimum of `less`) that does not appear in `no`, or it will remain 0 if no such integer is found.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Constraints**:
   - The program needs to handle constraints where `k` must be within a certain range and avoid specific values.
   - It should identify the maximum value from the "greater than or equal" constraints (`big` list) and the minimum value from the "less than or equal" constraints (`less` list).
   - Values in the "not equal to" constraints (`no` list) need to be avoided.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly initializes lists to store the constraints.
   - It reads the number of constraints and processes each constraint, categorizing them into `big`, `less`, and `no`.
   - The program attempts to find the first valid `k` value by iterating from the maximum of `big` to the minimum of `less`, checking if it's not in the `no` list.
   - If such a `k` is found, it prints the first valid `k`. Otherwise, it doesn't handle the case where no valid `k` is found.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes there will always be at least one valid `k` between the maximum of `big` and the minimum of `less`. However, this assumption might not hold true in all cases.
   - For example, if the maximum of `big` is greater than the minimum of `less`, or if the `no` list includes all values between the maximum of `big` and the minimum of `less`, the program will fail to find a valid `k`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not handle scenarios where no valid `k` exists between the maximum of `big` and the minimum of `less`.
   - It also does not account for the possibility that the constraints might overlap in such a way that no `k` satisfies all conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where no valid `k` exists between the maximum of `big` and the minimum of `less`. Additionally, it does not properly handle the scenario where the constraints overlap in a way that no `k` satisfies all conditions.

### Correctness:
**False**
