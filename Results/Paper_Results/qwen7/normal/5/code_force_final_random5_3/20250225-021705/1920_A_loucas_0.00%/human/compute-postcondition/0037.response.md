Postcondition: `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `big` and `less` are lists. If `x` equals 1, then `big` is a list containing `[a]`. If `x` equals 2, then `a` is appended to the list `less`. Otherwise, `a` remains as an input integer and `no` is a list containing `a`.
