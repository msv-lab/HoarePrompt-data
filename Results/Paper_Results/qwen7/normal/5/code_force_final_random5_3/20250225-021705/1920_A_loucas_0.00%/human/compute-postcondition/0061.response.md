Output State: **`iterable` is `prev_iterable + 1`; `iterable2` remains unchanged; `x` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `big` is an empty list; `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2 during the corresponding iteration; `no` contains all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2 during the corresponding iteration.**

Explanation: The line `big = []` initializes `big` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
