Output State: **`num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `a`. The initial values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `num`, `prev_iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `iterable`, `less`, `big`, and `no` retain their initial states, while `x` and `a` are assigned the values from the input.
