Postcondition: `num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a`, `x` is either equal to 1 or not equal to 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `x` is equal to 1, `big` becomes a list containing `a`. If `x` is equal to 2, `less` becomes a list containing `a`. Otherwise, `no` becomes a list containing the value of `a`.
