Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(max(big), min(less))`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `max(big) + 1`.
   - If `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the loop.
   - If `i` is in `no`, no action is taken regarding the break statement.

4. **Analyze the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `max(big) + 1`, it is not within the range `max(big)` to `min(less)` (assuming `max(big) + 1 > min(less)`).
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again because the condition `max(big) <= i < min(less)` is not satisfied.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and since the loop will not execute again, `i` remains `max(big) + 1`.
   - There is no change needed for `no` because the break condition is only checked if `i` is not in `no`, and since the loop does not execute, no further changes are required.

Given this analysis, the state remains unchanged for the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `max(big) + 1`, and if `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `no`, no action is taken regarding the break statement.**
