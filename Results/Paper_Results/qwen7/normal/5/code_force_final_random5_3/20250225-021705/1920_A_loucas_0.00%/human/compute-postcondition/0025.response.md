Output State: **`iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `a` is an input integer, `no` becomes a list containing the value of `a`. The other variables (`iterable2`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
