Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one, which is correct. However, the logic inside the loop to generate the sequence is flawed.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic**: The function `func_1` is intended to generate a sequence based on the input number. However, the logic inside this function is incorrect and does not produce the correct sequence of numbers that would yield exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

3. **Sequence Generation**: The sequence generation logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The current implementation seems to be trying to build a sequence using powers of 2, but it does not guarantee the correct count of increasing subsequences.

4. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself. This part is correct, but the sequence generated is not guaranteed to be correct.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to use a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving combinatorial mathematics or dynamic programming to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences is achieved. The current implementation does not meet these requirements.
