Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` attempts to generate a sequence based on the input `number`, but it does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

- Input: `X = 37`

The program generates an array `[0, 0, 2, 3, -1, -1, 0]`. However, this array does not have exactly 37 increasing subsequences. For instance, the subsequence `[0, 2, 3]` is counted multiple times due to the presence of `-1` values, which do not contribute to increasing subsequences but complicate the counting logic.

A correct implementation would need to carefully manage the generation of the array to ensure that the exact number of increasing subsequences matches `X`. The current approach does not guarantee this, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
