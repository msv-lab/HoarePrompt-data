You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Since `number` must be at least 31, the loop will run 5 times, setting `i` to 4 each time. The `sequence` list will contain 5 elements, all of which are 4.

    #State: Output State: `size` is 5, `i` is 7, `sequence` is undefined, `result` is undefined.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - 1`, which means it will run 5 times since `size` is initially 5. After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `i` becomes 4. After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `i` becomes 5. After the third iteration (`i = 2`), `i` becomes 6. Following this pattern, after the fourth iteration (`i = 3`), `i` becomes 7. Since the loop modifies `sequence` and `result` based on the current value of `i`, and these modifications are not defined beyond the third iteration, we can conclude that `sequence` and `result` are undefined after the loop completes all its iterations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate this sequence based on the input number `number`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function aims to construct a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences is determined by the input `number`.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to build the sequence.
   - The main logic involves setting up a sequence of numbers and adjusting values based on the binary representation of `number`.

3. **Binary Representation Approach**:
   - The function iteratively builds the sequence using powers of 2.
   - For a given `size`, it appends numbers from `0` to `size-1` to the sequence.
   - It then recursively adjusts these values based on the binary representation of `number`.

4. **Base Case and Recursive Case**:
   - When `number` is `0`, it returns `0` indicating the sequence is complete.
   - For non-zero `number`, it calculates the appropriate size and constructs the sequence accordingly.
   - It ensures that the sequence meets the requirement by adjusting values based on the binary representation.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The main loop prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
   - The sequence construction seems to correctly handle the binary representation and ensure the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `X`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the base case (`number == 0`) correctly.
   - It uses assertions to ensure the sequence is built correctly during recursion.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to generate the required sequence based on the input `X`.

### Correctness:
**True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the logic implemented in the `func_1` function.
