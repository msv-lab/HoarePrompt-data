Output State: **`size` is 4, `i` is 4, `number` must be greater than or equal to 31, `sequence` is [4, 4]**.

The code `sequence.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `sequence`. Initially, `sequence` contains only the element 4. After appending `i`, `sequence` becomes [4, 4]. The values of `size`, `i`, and `number` remain unchanged.
