Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `size`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `size` is 5
   - `i` is 4
   - `sequence` is modified such that its element at index `-result - 5` is incremented by `result`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `size`.
   - Given that `size` is 5, `i` needs to be 5 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, we need to update the state such that `i` is 5 and `size` remains 5. The modification to `sequence` does not affect the loop condition and thus does not need to be updated in this context.

**Final State**:
State: **`size` is 5, `i` is 5**
