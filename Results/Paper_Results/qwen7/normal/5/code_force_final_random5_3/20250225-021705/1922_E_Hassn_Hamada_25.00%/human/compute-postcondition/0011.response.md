Output State: `size` is 5 and `number` must be greater than or equal to 31.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `size` as long as `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`. After the third iteration, `size` is 4 and `number` must be at least 15. Each iteration doubles the threshold value for `number` (i.e., 3, 7, 15, ...), which follows the pattern \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\). Therefore, after the fourth iteration, `size` will be incremented to 5, and `number` must be at least 31 to continue the loop. Since the problem does not specify a stopping condition other than the initial state and the output after the first three iterations, we assume the loop will continue until `number` no longer meets the condition, resulting in `size` being 5 and `number` needing to be at least 31.
