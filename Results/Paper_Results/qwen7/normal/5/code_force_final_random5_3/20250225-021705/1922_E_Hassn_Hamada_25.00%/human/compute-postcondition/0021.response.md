Output State: **`size` is 5, `i` is 4, `number` must be greater than or equal to 31, `sequence` is [4, 4, 4, 4, 4], `result` is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**.

Explanation: The loop increments `size` by 1 each time until `(1 << size + 1) - 1` (which equals 31) is no longer less than or equal to `number`. Since `number` must be at least 31, the loop runs 5 times, setting `i` to 4 each time. The `sequence` list remains unchanged as it is only used in the function call. After the loop, the `result` is calculated as the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.
