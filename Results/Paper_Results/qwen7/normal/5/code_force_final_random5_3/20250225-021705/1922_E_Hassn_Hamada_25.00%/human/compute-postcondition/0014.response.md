Output State: **`size` is 4, `number` must be greater than or equal to 31, `sequence` is a list with one element `i`.**

The code `sequence.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sequence`. Since `i` is not defined before this line, it is assumed to be a variable that holds a value. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `i`, so it remains as `i`. The other variables (`size` and `number`) are not affected by this line of code.
