Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `size`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `size` is 5
   - `i` is 5
   - `sequence` is undefined
   - `result` is undefined

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs for each value of `i` in the range from 0 to `size - 1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue if `i < size`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5 and `size` is 5.
   - Since `i` is equal to `size`, the condition `i < size` is not satisfied.

5. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `size`.
   - This means `i` should be incremented by 1 (from 5 to 6) and `size` remains the same (5).

6. **Update the states**:
   - `size` remains 5.
   - `i` becomes 6.
   - `sequence` and `result` remain undefined as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`size` is 5, `i` is 6, `sequence` is undefined, `result` is undefined**
