Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, and it represents the number of test cases. All other variables are not yet defined.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    list0 = sorted(list0)
    count = 0
    for i in range(x - 1):
        num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
    num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
    if num == 1:
        count += 1
    print(count + x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, and `count` is incremented by 1 if `num` equals 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `count` is between 0 and `x-1` inclusive, `i` is `x - 1`, `T` is greater than or equal to 0, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, and if the current value of `num` is 1, then the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged since there is no else part provided.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is `x`, `T` is updated to `T - (x - 1)`, `num` is set to 1, `list0` remains sorted, `count` is the total number of times `num` equals 1 during the loop's execution, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
