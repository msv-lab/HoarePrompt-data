Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial condition that `T` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n`, `x`, and `y` as input integers and retains the condition on `T`.
