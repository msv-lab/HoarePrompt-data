Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of 1 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`, `start` is 2, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.**

Explanation: The code `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Given that `s` was previously equal to 1 (from the initial state), now `s` is equal to `1 + the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
