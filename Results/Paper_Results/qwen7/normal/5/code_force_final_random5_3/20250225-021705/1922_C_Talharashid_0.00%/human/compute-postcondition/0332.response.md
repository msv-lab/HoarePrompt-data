Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `start != end`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 4 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `t` is the same (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `m` must be greater than 3 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `s` is either 1 or the sum of `s` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
   - `start` is 0 (relevant to the loop condition)
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s` (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `inc` is 1 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `mini` (not relevant to the loop condition)

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `start`.

4. **Adjust the Relevant State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must be different from `end`. Since `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `end` is a constant value that doesn't change within the loop. Therefore, `start` must be incremented to a value that is not equal to `end`.

5. **Final State Adjustment**: Since `start` is currently 0, it needs to be incremented to a value that is not equal to `end`. Given that `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0, the smallest possible value for `end` is 1. Therefore, `start` must be incremented to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `s` is either 1 or the sum of `s` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, `start` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, and `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `mini`**.
