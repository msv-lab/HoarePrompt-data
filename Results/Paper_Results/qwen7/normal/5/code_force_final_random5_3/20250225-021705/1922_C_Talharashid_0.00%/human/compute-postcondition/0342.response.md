Postcondition: `i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of 1 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`, `start` is 2, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.

This means that regardless of whether the condition `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` is true or false, the final state of the variables will be as follows: `i` remains 4, `t` remains unchanged, `m` stays greater than 3, `end` remains the length of `lst` minus 1 and is greater than 0, `s` is updated to be the sum of 1 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`, `start` remains 2, `d1` is a defaultdict with `s` as its value at key 0, `d2` remains a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` remains 1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.
