Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`; `start` is unchanged and is less than the length of `lst`; `end` is unchanged; `inc` is unchanged; `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`; `i` is unchanged; `m` is unchanged; `d2` is unchanged; `s2` is unchanged; `s1` is unchanged; `n` is unchanged; `lst` is unchanged; `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`**

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
