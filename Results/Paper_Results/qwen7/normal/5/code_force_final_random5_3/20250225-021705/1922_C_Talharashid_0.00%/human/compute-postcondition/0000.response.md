Output State: **`t` is reduced to an input integer, and the initial conditions for `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, and `y_i` remain unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means `t` now holds the value of the input integer. However, since no values have been assigned to `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, and `y_i`, their initial conditions remain valid.
