Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is 0, `start` is now equal to `len(lst) - 1` and `len(lst)` must be greater than 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is 11111111.**

The line `mini = 11111111` assigns the value `11111111` to the variable `mini`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
