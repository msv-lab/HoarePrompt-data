Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, `start` is decremented by 1 (if `start - 1` is greater than `-1`), `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, and `mini` is either `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` or not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**

This means that the dictionary `d2` now has an entry where the key is the updated `start` (which was decremented by 1) and the value is `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
