Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` to `s2`. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `end`, `s`, `start`, and `s1`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
