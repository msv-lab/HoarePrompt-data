Postcondition: `start` is increased by `inc` and must not be equal to `end`; `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`. If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is `start + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is updated by adding `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` to its current value.
