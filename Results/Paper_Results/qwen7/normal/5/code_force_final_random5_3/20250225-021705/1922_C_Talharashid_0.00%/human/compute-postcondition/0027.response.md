Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` added to the original `s`, `start` must be different from `end`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`, and `start` is less than `end` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and `start - 1` is greater than -1, and `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**

This means that the variable `s` has been updated by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` to its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
