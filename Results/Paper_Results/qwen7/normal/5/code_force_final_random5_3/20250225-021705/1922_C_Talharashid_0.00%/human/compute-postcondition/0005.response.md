Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` must be greater than 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int; `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int; `n` is an input integer; `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `lst` by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The input is expected to be a series of space-separated integers. The variables `i`, `t`, `d1`, `d2`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
