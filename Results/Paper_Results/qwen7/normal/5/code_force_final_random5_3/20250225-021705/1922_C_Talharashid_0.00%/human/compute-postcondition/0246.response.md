Postcondition: **`inc` is -1, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[0] - lst[-1])` and `11111111`, `s` is 2 if `mini` equals `abs(lst[0] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s` is the sum of `s` and `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` remains unchanged from its initial state, `d1[start]` is equal to `mini`, `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state except for the entry at index `start`, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`.**
