Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is `end - 3`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 3`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `n` is an input integer.**

In this scenario, the code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
