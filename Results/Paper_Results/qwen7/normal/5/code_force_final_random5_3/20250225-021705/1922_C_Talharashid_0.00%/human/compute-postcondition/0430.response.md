Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `m` is greater than 4
   - `start` is 3
   - `s` is 0
   - `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[3]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.
   - `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < m`, and `i` is currently 4, `m` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 5.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**State: **`i` is 5, `m` is greater than 4**
