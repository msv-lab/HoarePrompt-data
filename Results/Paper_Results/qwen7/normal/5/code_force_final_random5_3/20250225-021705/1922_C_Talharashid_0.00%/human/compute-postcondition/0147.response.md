Output State: **`start` is the input integer - 3, `end` is the input integer - 3, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is 3, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is the corresponding absolute difference from the other branch, end is decreased by 1.**

In this case, the code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `s`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The `end` variable is also decreased by 1, but its new value is not specified in the initial state, so we only note that it has been decremented.
