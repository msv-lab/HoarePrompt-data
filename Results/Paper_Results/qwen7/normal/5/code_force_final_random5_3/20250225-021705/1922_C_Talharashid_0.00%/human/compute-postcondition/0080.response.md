Output State: **`end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `start` is different from 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, `start` plus 1 is less than the length of `lst`, `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, where `inc` is -1. Since `start` is different from 0 and `start + inc` (which is `start - 1`) is within the bounds of the list, `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
