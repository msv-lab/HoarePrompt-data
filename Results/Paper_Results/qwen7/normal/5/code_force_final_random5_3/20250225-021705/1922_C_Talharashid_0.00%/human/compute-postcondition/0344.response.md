Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of 1 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`, `start` is 3, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.**

Explanation: The variable `start` is incremented by `inc` (which is 1), so `start` changes from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given postconditions.
