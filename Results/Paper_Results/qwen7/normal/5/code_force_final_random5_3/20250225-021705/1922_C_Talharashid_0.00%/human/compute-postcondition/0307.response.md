Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is `end - 3`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 3`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list named `lst`. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `m`, `end`, `s`, `start`, `d1`, `d2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
