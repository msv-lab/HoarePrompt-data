Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n and a strictly increasing list of n non-negative integers. It also takes an integer m and m pairs of distinct integers x_i and y_i. The function calculates and prints the minimum value between two distances based on the processed data. Specifically, it computes distances for both forward and backward traversals through the list and finds the minimum distance between the given pairs (x_i, y_i) considering the calculated distances.**
