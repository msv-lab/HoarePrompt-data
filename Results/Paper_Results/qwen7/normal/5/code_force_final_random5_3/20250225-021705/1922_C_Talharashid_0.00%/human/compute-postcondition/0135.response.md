Output State: **`start` is the input integer - 1, `end` is the input integer - 2, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is either `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` or `abs(d2[end] - d1[start])`, `i` is 2, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d2[end])`**

Explanation: The code `end -= 1` decrements the value of `end` by 1. Initially, `end` was `input integer - 1`. After decrementing, `end` becomes `input integer - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
