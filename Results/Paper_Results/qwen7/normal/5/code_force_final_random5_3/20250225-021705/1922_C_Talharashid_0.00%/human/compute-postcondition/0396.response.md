Postcondition: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is either 2 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `start` must be decremented further until it is not equal to 0, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` and `d2[start]` are `s`, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`.**
