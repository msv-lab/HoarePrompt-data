Output State: **`start` is the input integer - 1, `end` is the input integer - 2, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is 2, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d2[end])**.

Explanation: The line `s = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
