Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`**

Explanation: The code calculates `s2` as the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. The values of `i`, `m`, `end`, `s`, `start`, and `s1` remain unchanged from their initial states. `s2` is newly introduced with its value being the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`.
