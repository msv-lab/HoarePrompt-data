Output State: `start` is `initial_value - m`, `end` is `initial_value - m - 1`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is 0, `i` is `m`, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, and `s1` is the corresponding absolute difference from the other branch.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `start` will be set to the initial value minus the total number of iterations (`initial_value - m`). The `end` variable will be one less than `start`. Both `inc` and `mini` retain their values from the last iteration, with `inc` staying at -1 and `mini` being the smallest distance found throughout the loop. The variable `s` remains 0 as it is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. The loop counter `i` reaches `m` after all iterations. The values of `s1` and `s2` are determined based on the conditions inside the loop but are reset to 0 at the start of each iteration.
