Output State: **`i` is 4, `m` is greater than 4, `start` is 3, `s` is 0, `s1` is abs(`d1[end]` - `d1[3]`).**

Explanation: The code assigns the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` to `s1`. Since `start` is 3, `s1` is calculated as `abs(d1[end] - d1[3])`. The values of `i`, `m`, `start`, and `s` remain unchanged.
