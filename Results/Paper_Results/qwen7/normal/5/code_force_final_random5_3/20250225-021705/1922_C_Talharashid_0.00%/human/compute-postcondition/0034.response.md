Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` added to the original `s`, `start` is less than `end` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and `start - 1` is greater than -1, and `start` must not be equal to `end`.**

Explanation: The line `mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)` updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum of the current value of `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
