Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `start != end`.
2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable involved in the loop condition is `start`.

Given the loop condition `start != end`, for the loop to execute one more time, `start` must be different from `end`. At the end of the previous iteration, `start` has been increased by `inc`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `start` should still not be equal to `end`.

Since no other variables in the loop head (`start` and `end`) are directly modified within the loop body, and the only way to ensure the loop continues is to keep `start` unequal to `end`, we need to ensure that `start` is not equal to `end` after the increment.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `start` must not be equal to `end`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`start` is increased by `inc` and must not be equal to `end`**
