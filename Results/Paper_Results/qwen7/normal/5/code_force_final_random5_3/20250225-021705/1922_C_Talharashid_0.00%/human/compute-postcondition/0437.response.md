Output State: **`i` is 5, `m` is greater than 3, `end` is decreased by 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is abs(`d2[end]` - `d2[start]`).**

The code assigns the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` to `s1`. However, since `d2` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `s1`. But we know that `s` remains unchanged at 0, and the other variables (`i`, `m`, and `end`) are also unchanged except that `end` is decreased by 1.
