Output State: **`i` is 4, `m` is greater than 4, `start` is 3, `s` is 0, `s1` is abs(`d2[end]` - `d2[start]`), `s2` is abs(`d1[start]` - `d1[end]`).**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` to `s2`. Since `start` is 3 and `end` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `s2`, but we know it is the absolute difference between `d1[3]` and `d1[end]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
