Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `start` is `start - 1`**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` and assigns it to `s1`. Since `d2` is not defined, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `s1`. However, we know the updated states of the variables as mentioned above.
