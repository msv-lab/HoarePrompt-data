Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, `start` is unchanged and is less than the length of `lst`, `end` is unchanged, `inc` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `d2` is unchanged, `s2` is unchanged, `s1` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `lst` is unchanged.**

The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `start - 1` is greater than `-1` is also preserved.
