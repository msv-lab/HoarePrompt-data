Output State: **`index` is 8 + n, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[4:7]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was `7 + n`. After the increment, `index` becomes `8 + n`. The other variables (`t`, `results`, `arr`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
