Output State: **`index` is 7, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[4:7]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by mapping each element in the slice `data[index:index + n]` to an integer. Given that `index` is 4 and `n` is the integer value from `data[2]`, the slice `data[4:7]` is converted to a list of integers. The value of `index` is updated to `index + n`, which is 7. The other variables (`t` and `results`) remain unchanged.
