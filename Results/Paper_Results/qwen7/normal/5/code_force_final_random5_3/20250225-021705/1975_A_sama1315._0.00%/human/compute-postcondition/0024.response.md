Output State: **`index` is 10 + `n`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the value of `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[9 + `n` + `n` : 9 + 2*`n`], `n` is an integer obtained from `data[9 + `n` + `n`]**.

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by `n`, changing its value from `9 + n + n` to `10 + n`. The values of `t`, `results`, `arr`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
