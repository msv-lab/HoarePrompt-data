Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the current state of `t`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and it is decremented by 1.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**: For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is decremented by 1 at each iteration, if `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be equal to 0 or less than 0, depending on how many times the loop has run.

4. **Adjust the state**: Given that `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it means `t` is now equal to 0 (since it was decremented by 1).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is now 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`index` is 8 + n + n, `t` is 0, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the value of `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`**
