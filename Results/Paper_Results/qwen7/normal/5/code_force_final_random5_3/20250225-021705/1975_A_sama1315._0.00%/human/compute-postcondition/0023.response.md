Output State: **`index` is 9 + `n` + `n`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the value of `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[9 + `n` + `n` : 9 + 2*`n`], `n` is an integer obtained from `data[9 + `n` + `n`], `arr` is updated to map each element in the slice of `data` to an integer.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr` by converting each element in the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into an integer using the `map` function. The other variables (`index`, `t`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged. The new value of `arr` is derived from the specified slice of `data`.
