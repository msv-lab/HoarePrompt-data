Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `t` after converting it to an integer. Since `index` was initially 0, after the assignment, `index` is incremented to 1. The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 1000, as specified. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial states.
