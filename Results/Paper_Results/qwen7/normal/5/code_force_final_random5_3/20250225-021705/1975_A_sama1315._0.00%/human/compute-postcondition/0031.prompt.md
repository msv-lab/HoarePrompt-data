You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and arr is a list of n integers where each element is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(arr)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is 10 + 2*n, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the specified slices of `data` as per the loop's logic, `result` is the last return value of `func_1(arr)` added to the `results` list.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed:
    #- The variable `index` will be at the position right after the last processed array, specifically 10 plus twice the value of `n`.
    #- The variable `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more iterations left to perform.
    #- The `results` list will contain the outputs from `func_1(arr)` for each iteration of the loop.
    #- The variable `arr` and `result` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, but since the loop has finished, these variables are no longer being updated and can be considered as part of the final state.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the return values of func_1(arr) for each iteration, each on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 1000), n (an integer between 2 and 50), and arr (a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6). The function returns a value based on the input parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
