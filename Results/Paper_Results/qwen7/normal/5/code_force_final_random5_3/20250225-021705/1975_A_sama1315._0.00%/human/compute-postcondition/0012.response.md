Output State: **`index` is 7 + `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[4:7]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**

Explanation: The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` (which is the return value of `func_1(arr)`) to the list `results`. The other variables (`index`, `t`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
