Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". It returns the sum of all elements `s[i]` for every `i` corresponding to the first element of each tuple in `d`.**

Note: The provided output description seems to reference a variable `d` which is not defined in the function signature. Assuming `d` is a predefined dictionary where keys are indices of the string `s` and values are tuples containing elements relevant to the sum calculation.
