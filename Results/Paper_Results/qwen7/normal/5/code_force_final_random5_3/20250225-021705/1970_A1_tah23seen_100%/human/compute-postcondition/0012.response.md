Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition is `range(len(s))`, meaning `i` should iterate from 0 to `len(s) - 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `d[1]` is either `d[0] + 1` or `d[0] - 1` depending on whether `s[i]` is `(` or not.

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute:**
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` would be 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < len(s)`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it is the length of `s`, which does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `d[1]` will depend on the character `s[1]` (since `i` is now 1), but the exact value is not specified in the problem statement. It will be either `d[0] + 1` or `d[0] - 1` based on whether `s[1]` is `(` or not.

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` is still the length of `s`.
   - `d[1]` will be either `d[0] + 1` or `d[0] - 1` depending on whether `s[1]` is `(` or not.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, and `d[1]` is either `d[0] + 1` or `d[0] - 1` depending on whether `s[1]` is `(` or not.**
