Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")`. It calculates the depth of each parenthesis in the string and stores these depths in a dictionary `d`. The dictionary is then sorted based on the depth values, and the function constructs a new string `ans` by concatenating the characters from `s` corresponding to the keys in the sorted dictionary. Finally, the function returns the sum of all elements `s[i]` for every `i` corresponding to the first element of each tuple in the sorted dictionary `d`.**
