Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `s` and `n`, while adding that `ans` is now an empty string.
