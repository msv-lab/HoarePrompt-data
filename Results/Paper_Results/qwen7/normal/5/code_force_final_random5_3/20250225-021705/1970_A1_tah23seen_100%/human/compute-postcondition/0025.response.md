Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `(i, j)` and the list `d`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `d`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `d`**: The list `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, and then by the negative first element of each tuple.

4. **Adjust the state of `d`**: For the loop to execute, the list `d` must contain at least one tuple. Additionally, the variables `i` and `j` will take the values from the first tuple in the list during the first iteration.

Given this information, we can summarize the necessary adjustments:

- The list `d` must contain at least one tuple.
- During the first iteration, `i` will be the first element of the first tuple in `d`, and `j` will be the second element of the first tuple in `d`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, and then by the negative first element of each tuple, and `d` must have at least one tuple, `i` is the first element of the first tuple in `d`, and `j` is the second element of the first tuple in `d`.**
