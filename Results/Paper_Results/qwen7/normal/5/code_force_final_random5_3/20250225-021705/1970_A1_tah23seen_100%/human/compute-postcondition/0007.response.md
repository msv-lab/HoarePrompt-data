Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is the length of `s`; `d[i + 1]` is `d[1]` and its value is `d[0] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d[i + 1]` to be `d[i] + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `d[i + 1]` becomes `d[1]` and its value is set to `d[0] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
