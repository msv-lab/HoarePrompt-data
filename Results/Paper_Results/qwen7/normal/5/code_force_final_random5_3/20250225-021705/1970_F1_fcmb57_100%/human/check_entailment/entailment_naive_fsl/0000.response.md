Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle to a goal belonging to their own team. According to the problem description, if a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the opposing team should win a point. However, the program does not account for this scenario. For example, consider the following input:

```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
12
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
```

In this case, the red player takes the Quaffle, moves to the right, and throws it into the red goal (RG). The program should detect this and print `1 RED GOAL`, but instead, it prints nothing and the final score is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
