Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is still greater than 0, and `i` is still 0. The new variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained from the input.
