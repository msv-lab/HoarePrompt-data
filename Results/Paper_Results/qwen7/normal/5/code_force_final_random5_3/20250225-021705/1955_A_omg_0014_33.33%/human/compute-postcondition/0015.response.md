Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `c` is an integer from the input.
- `d` is equal to `c / 2`.

The relevant part for the `print` statement is `d = c / 2`, and then `print(round(a * d))`.

Here, `d` is set to `c / 2`. Since `c` is an integer, `c / 2` will result in either an integer or a float depending on whether `c` is even or odd. When rounded, it will be an integer.

So, the expression `round(a * d)` will take the integer `a` and multiply it by `d` (which is `c / 2`), and then round the result to the nearest integer.

Given the values of `a` and `d` are derived from the input, we cannot determine the exact numerical value without knowing the specific inputs for `a` and `c`. However, the format of the output is clear.

Output: **round(a * (c / 2))**
