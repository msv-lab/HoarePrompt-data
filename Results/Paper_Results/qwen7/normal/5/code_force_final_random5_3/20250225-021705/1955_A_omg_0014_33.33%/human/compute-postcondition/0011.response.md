Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` must be 0
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split
   - `d` is equal to `c / 2`
   - If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be 1.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not affected by the loop itself and remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body. However, since the problem states that no changes are made to these variables if `a * b` is less than `a * d`, and otherwise `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`, we need to consider the condition.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, `d` is equal to `c / 2`, and if `a * b` is less than `a * d`, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`**.
