You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer that was initially provided and must be greater than 0, i is equal to n - 1 (after all iterations of the loop), a, b, and c are integers obtained from the input split during each iteration, d is equal to c / 2 for each iteration, and the loop has printed either a * b or round(a * d) for each iteration based on the condition a * b < a * d.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\). It calculates and prints either \(a \times b\) or \(a \times \frac{c}{2}\) (where \(c\) is another input integer) based on whether \(a \times b\) is less than \(a \times \frac{c}{2}\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. Specifically, the program does not consider the scenario where it might be cheaper to buy some yogurts individually and some in pairs. 

For example, in the third test case of the example (`3 5 11`), the program would calculate the cost as `11` (since `c/2` is `5.5`, rounded up to `6`, and `3*6=18`), but the correct minimum cost is `15` (buying two yogurts for `11` and one for `5`).

The program uses `d = c / 2` and rounds it up, which does not always give the optimal solution. It should consider both buying individual yogurts and buying pairs to find the minimum cost.
