The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\). It calculates and prints either \(a \times b\) or \(a \times \frac{c}{2}\) (where \(c\) is another input integer) based on whether \(a \times b\) is less than \(a \times \frac{c}{2}\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
