Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. Specifically, the program does not consider the scenario where it might be cheaper to buy some yogurts individually and some in pairs. 

For example, in the third test case of the example (`3 5 11`), the program would calculate the cost as `11` (since `c/2` is `5.5`, rounded up to `6`, and `3*6=18`), but the correct minimum cost is `15` (buying two yogurts for `11` and one for `5`).

The program uses `d = c / 2` and rounds it up, which does not always give the optimal solution. It should consider both buying individual yogurts and buying pairs to find the minimum cost.
