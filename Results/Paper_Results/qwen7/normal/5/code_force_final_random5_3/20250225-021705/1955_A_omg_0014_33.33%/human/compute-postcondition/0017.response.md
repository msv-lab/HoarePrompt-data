Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is an integer from the input.
   - `b` is an integer from the input.
   - `c` is an integer from the input.
   - `d` is equal to `c / 2`, and `d` is now set to `c / 2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `d` is equal to `c / 2`**.
