You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer that was initially provided and must be greater than 0, i is equal to n - 1 (after all iterations of the loop), a, b, and c are integers obtained from the input split during each iteration, d is equal to c / 2 for each iteration, and the loop has printed either a * b or round(a * d) for each iteration based on the condition a * b < a * d.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, n, and a, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and n and a are integers between 1 and 100 and 1 and 30 respectively. The function does not return a specific value but seems to process these integers in some way, possibly involving t test cases, each with its own n and a values.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
