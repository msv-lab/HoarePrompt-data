Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value does not affect the print statement directly.
- `n` must be greater than 0. This value also does not affect the print statement directly.
- `i` is 2. This value does not affect the print statement directly.
- `a` is an integer from the input. This value is unknown but will be used in the print statement.
- `b` is an integer from the input. This value is unknown but will be used in the print statement.
- `c` is an integer from the input. This value is unknown but will be used in the calculation of `d`.
- `d` is equal to `c / 2`. Since `c` is an integer, `d` will be the integer division of `c` by 2.

The print statement `print(a * b)` will print the product of `a` and `b`.

Output: **a * b (where a and b are integers from the input)**
