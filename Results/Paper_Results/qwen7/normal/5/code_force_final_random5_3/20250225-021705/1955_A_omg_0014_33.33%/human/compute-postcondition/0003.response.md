Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, `d` is equal to `c / 2`.**

The code assigns the value of `c / 2` to the variable `d`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
