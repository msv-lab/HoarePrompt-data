Reasoning:
- The program reads the number of test cases (`kreker`) and then iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- It then calls the function `func_1()` which performs the necessary logic to check if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The function `func_1()` correctly checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.
- There are no issues with the logic or the implementation of the function.
- The program correctly handles all the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
