Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required for the problem. Specifically, the program's `func_1` function checks if \( n \geq m \) and prints 'Yes' if true, and 'No' otherwise. However, this logic is flawed because:

- The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- Therefore, the number of cubes in the tower after \( n \) moves can only be an odd number if \( n \) is odd (since starting from 0, adding or removing one cube alternates between even and odd).
- Conversely, the number of cubes can only be an even number if \( n \) is even.

Given this, the correct condition should check whether \( n \) and \( m \) have the same parity (both even or both odd).

The provided code does not account for this parity check, which means it will incorrectly determine whether it is possible to have \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

Correctness: **False**
