The function processes a test case consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)). It compares \( n \) and \( m \), and prints 'Yes' if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \); otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output stream by printing either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison.
