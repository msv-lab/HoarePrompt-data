### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`, which is correct for parsing space-separated integers from a single line.

3. **Logic Check**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` checks if `n` (number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (desired number of cubes).
   - If `n >= m`, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases as per the problem statement. For example:
     - When `n == m`, it prints 'Yes' because he can just add `m` cubes.
     - When `n < m`, it prints 'No' because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the total number of moves.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the requirement, printing 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case without quotes and in any case (lowercase or uppercase).

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
