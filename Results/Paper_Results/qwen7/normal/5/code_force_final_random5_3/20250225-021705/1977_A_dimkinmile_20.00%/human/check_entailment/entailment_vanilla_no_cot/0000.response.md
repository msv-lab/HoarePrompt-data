Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically:

- The function `func_1()` is called without passing any arguments, which means it will use local variables that are not defined (`n` and `m`), leading to a runtime error.
- Even if the function definition were correct and called with the appropriate arguments, the logic inside `func_1()` is flawed. It only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, but it does not account for the balance between adding and removing cubes.

To fix this, you should pass the values of `n` and `m` to `func_1()` and correctly check if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, m)

def func_1(n, m):
    if abs(n - 2 * m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The function `func_1(n, m)` takes two parameters `n` and `m`.
- The condition `abs(n - 2 * m) % 2 == 0` checks if the difference between `n` and twice `m` is even. This ensures that the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in exactly `m` cubes.
- If the condition is true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
