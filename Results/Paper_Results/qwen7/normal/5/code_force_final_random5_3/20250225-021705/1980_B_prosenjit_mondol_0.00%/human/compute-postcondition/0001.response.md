Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. Since `num` is a positive integer from the initial state and the code does not involve `num`, its value remains unchanged. The new variables `n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values obtained from the input.
