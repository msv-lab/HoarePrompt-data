Postcondition: `num` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `f` is one less than the integer obtained from the input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the input split minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`. After executing the if-else block, `a[k]` is either greater than `x` (if the if condition is true) or less than or equal to `x` (if the else condition is true).
