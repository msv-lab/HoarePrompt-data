Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each test case consists of three integers n, f, and k such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, followed by a list of n integers a_i where 1 <= a_i <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `f` is one less than the integer obtained from the input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the input split minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`. After executing the if-else block, `a[k]` is either greater than `x` (if the if condition is true) or less than or equal to `x` (if the else condition is true).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer obtained from the input split, `f` is now f-1, `k` is f-2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`. No changes are made to the variables regardless of whether `a[k] > x` or `a[k] <= x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer obtained from the input split, `f` is now `n - 3`, `k` is `n - 3`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 3`. The condition `a[k] > x` holds true if `a[k]` is greater than `x`; otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
