Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `f` is one less than the integer obtained from the input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the input split minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The values of `num`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
