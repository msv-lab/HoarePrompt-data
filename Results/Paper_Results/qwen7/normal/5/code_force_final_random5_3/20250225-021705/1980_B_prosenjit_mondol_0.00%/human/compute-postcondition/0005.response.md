Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `f` is one less than the integer obtained from the input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the input split minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at index `f` (which is `f+1` in terms of list indexing) in the list `a` to the variable `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
