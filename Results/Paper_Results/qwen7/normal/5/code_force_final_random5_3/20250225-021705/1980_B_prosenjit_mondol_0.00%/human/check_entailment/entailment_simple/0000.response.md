Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` and adjusts `f` and `k` to be zero-indexed.
3. It then reads the list of values `a` and sorts it in descending order.
4. The program checks if the value of the `k`-th element in the sorted list is greater than the value of the favorite cube (`x`). If it is, the favorite cube is not removed, so it prints 'NO'.
5. If the value of the `k`-th element is less than `x`, the favorite cube is definitely removed, so it prints 'YES'.
6. If the value of the `k`-th element is equal to `x`, the program further checks if the `(k+1)`-th element is less than `x`. If it is, the favorite cube is removed, so it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.

Given the logic and the steps outlined above, the program appears to handle all edge cases and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
