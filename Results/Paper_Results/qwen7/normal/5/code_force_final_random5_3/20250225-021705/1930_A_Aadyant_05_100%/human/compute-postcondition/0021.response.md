Output State: **`s` is the integer value of `list2[3]`, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string that must contain at least one space-separated word, `i` is 3**.

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated by adding the integer value of `list2[i]` to its current value. Since `i` is 3, `s` becomes the integer value of `list2[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
