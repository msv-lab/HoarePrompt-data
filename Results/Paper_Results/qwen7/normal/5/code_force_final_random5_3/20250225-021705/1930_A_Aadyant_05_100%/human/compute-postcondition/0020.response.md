Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes `i` and `list2`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `len(list2)` with a step of 2. This means `i` will take values 0, 2, 4, etc.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is 0 plus the integer value of `list2[0]`.
   - `list2` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is an input string that must contain at least one space-separated word.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 2 each time, and it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be 3 (1 + 2).

5. **Check if the loop can continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(list2)`. Given that `i` is now 3, the loop will continue as long as `len(list2) > 3`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `s` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted.
   - `list2` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted.
   - `a` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted.
   - `b` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted.
   - `i` is now 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`s` is 0 plus the integer value of `list2[0]`, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string that must contain at least one space-separated word, `i` is 3**
