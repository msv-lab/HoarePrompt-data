Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for fin in final:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `fin` and `final`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `final` contains at least one element.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `final` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `final` must still contain at least one element.
   - The variable `fin` will be set to the first element of `final` in the next iteration, but its specific value is not relevant to the loop continuation condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `final`, which must still contain at least one element.

**State: **`final` must contain at least one element**
