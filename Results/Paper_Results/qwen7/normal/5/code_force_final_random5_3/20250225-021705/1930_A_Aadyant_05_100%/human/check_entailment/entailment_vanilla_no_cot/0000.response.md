Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` but does not process it. It directly processes the first test case and ignores any additional test cases.
2. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is flawed. The program calculates the sum of every other element in the sorted list, which does not necessarily give the maximum score. The optimal strategy involves pairing the smallest elements together to maximize the score.
3. **Loop Structure**: The loop structure is confusing and unnecessary. The program should simply sort the list and then pair the smallest elements to maximize the score.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        numbers = list(map(int, data[index:index + 2 * n]))
        index += 2 * n
        
        numbers.sort()
        score = sum(numbers[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        
        results.append(score)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This corrected program properly handles multiple test cases and uses the optimal strategy to calculate the maximum score.
