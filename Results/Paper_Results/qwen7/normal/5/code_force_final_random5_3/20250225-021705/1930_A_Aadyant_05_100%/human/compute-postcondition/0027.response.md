Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for num in range(int(n))`. The variables involved here are `num` and `int(n)`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: 
   - `s` is the sum of all integers in `list2` at even indices.
   - `list2` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is an input string that must contain at least one space-separated word.
   - `i` is equal to the last even index processed, which is `len(list2) - 1`.
   - `final` is a list containing the value of `s`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `num < int(n)`. 

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the last even index processed, which means `i = len(list2) - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `num` must be incremented from its previous value. Since `num` starts from 0, it will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `num` will be 1 in the next iteration.
   - `int(n)` remains unchanged because it is determined by the value of `n` before the loop starts.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `s` remains unchanged as the loop body is omitted.
   - `list2` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `final` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is the sum of all integers in `list2` at even indices, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string that must contain at least one space-separated word, `i` is equal to the last even index processed which is `len(list2) - 1`, `final` is a list containing the value of `s`, `num` is 1**.
