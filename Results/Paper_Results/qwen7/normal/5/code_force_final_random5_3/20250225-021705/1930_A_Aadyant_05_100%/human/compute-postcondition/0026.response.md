Output State: **`s` is the sum of all integers in `list2` at even indices, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string that must contain at least one space-separated word, `i` is equal to the last even index processed which is `len(list2) - 1`, `final` is a list containing the value of `s`.**

Explanation: The line `final.append(s)` appends the current value of `s` to the list `final`. Since `s` is the sum of all integers in `list2` at even indices, and `i` is the last even index processed, the values of `list2`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `final` now contains the sum `s` as its only element.
