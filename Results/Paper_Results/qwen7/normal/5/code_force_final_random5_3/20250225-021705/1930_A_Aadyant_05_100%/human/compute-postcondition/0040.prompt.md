Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `i` is equal to the last even index processed which is `len(list2) - 1`, `final` is a list containing the value of `s`, `num` is 1, `list1` is a list of words from `b`.
Code of the loop:
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `list1` is a list of words from `b` that must have at least 1 word; `list2` contains an element which is the integer representation of `str`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `list1` is a list of words from `b` that must have at least 1 word; `list2` contains an element which is the integer representation of the current word in `list1`, and `list2` has appended an integer representation of `str`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `list1` is a list of words from `b` that must have at least 1 word; `list2` contains an element which is the integer representation of the next word in `list1`; `list2` is appended with the integer value of `str`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
