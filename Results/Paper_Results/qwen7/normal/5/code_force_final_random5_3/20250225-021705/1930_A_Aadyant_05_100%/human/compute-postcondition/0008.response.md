Output State: **`s` is 0; `list2` is an empty list; `a` is an input string; `b` is an input string; `list1` is a list of words obtained by splitting `b` by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of substrings based on whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) and assigns this list to `list1`. The other variables (`s`, `list2`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
