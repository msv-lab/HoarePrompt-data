Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not simulate the game correctly. According to the problem description, Nene always selects cards optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. However, the current implementation of `func_1` only calculates the maximum possible score you can get based on the distribution of cards, without considering Nene's optimal strategy.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

In this case, the program will output `1`, which is correct according to the current logic. However, let's consider another scenario:

```
1
4
2 2 3 3
```

In this case, if you select a card with a `2` or `3`, Nene will also select the other card with the same number, resulting in no points for you. Therefore, the optimal strategy would be to not select any card, resulting in a score of `0`. The current implementation does not account for this scenario, as it does not simulate Nene's optimal moves.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
