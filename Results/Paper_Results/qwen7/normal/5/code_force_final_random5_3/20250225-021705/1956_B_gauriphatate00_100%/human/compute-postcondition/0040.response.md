Output State: **The final value of `max_score` is 2, `num` is n, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `num` (which is now `n`) must be in `count_a` with a value of 2.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `max_score` will be 2 if every `num` from 1 to `n` (where `n` is at least 3) was found in `count_a` with a value of 2. The variable `num` will end up being the last value of `n`, and all other conditions must still hold as they did after the third iteration.
