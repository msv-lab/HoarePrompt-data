Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `num` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each `num` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_score` is 0.
   - `num` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `num` is in `count_a`.

4. **Loop Body Analysis**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `count_a[num]` is 2, no changes are made to `max_score` and `num`. Otherwise, some operation might change these values.

5. **Determine the Next Value of `num`**:
   - Since `num` starts at 1 and the loop increments `num` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `num` will be 2.

6. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0, and `num` (which is now 2) must be in `count_a`.

7. **Adjust the States**:
   - `num` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `num` (now 2) must be in `count_a`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`max_score` is 0, `num` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and `num` (now 2) must be in `count_a`**.
