State: **`max_score` is 0, `num` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable in the for loop is `num`, which is initialized to 1 and iterates from 1 to `n`.
2. The loop will continue as long as `num` is less than or equal to `n`.
3. For the loop to start executing, `num` must be 1 (the initial value) and `n` must be greater than 0 (otherwise, the loop would not start).
4. The state of `max_score` is not directly related to the loop's execution condition but could be modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `num` set to 1 and `n` must be greater than 0.
