Reasoning:
- The provided program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with the list of integers representing the cards in your hand and the number of cards.
- The function `func_1` aims to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally against Nene, who plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- However, the implementation of `func_1` simply counts how many numbers in the list `a` appear exactly twice. This is incorrect because:
  - Nene's strategy is to maximize her score while minimizing yours, which means she would strategically choose cards to block your points when possible.
  - The function does not simulate the game or consider Nene's optimal moves.

Given the execution summary, the function incorrectly returns 2 for every test case, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
