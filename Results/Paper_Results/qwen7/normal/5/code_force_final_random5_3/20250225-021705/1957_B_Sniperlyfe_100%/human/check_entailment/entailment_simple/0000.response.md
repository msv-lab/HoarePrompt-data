Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits. This ensures that the first element contributes the maximum possible number of 1s in the binary representation.
   - It then reduces `k` by this value.
   - For subsequent elements, it sets each to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` is still positive. This ensures that each additional element also contributes to maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
   - Finally, it adjusts `nums[0]` to include the remaining value of `k`.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program formats the output correctly by joining the elements of `nums` into a string with spaces and appending each result to `results`.
   - It prints the results in the required format.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is small enough so that adding `nums[0] + 1` to all other elements would exceed `n`, the function correctly handles this by setting `nums[0]` to `k` and setting the rest to 0.

Given the logic and the steps taken, the function `func_1` correctly constructs the sequence according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
