Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to 1 (since the range is `range(1, n)`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop starts with `i` set to 1, we need to ensure that `i` is 1 initially and that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
- The sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `nums` is a list of length `n` containing only zeros.
- `k` is decreased by \((1 << (k\text{'s bit length} - 1)) - 1\).

Since the loop starts with `i` set to 1, we need to ensure that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
