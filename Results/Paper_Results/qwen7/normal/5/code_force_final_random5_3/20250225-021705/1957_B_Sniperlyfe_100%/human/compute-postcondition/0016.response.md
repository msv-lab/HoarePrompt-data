Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is decreased by `nums[1]`, `nums[2]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, and `nums[i]` (which is `nums[3]`) is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 3, `k` is decreased by `nums[1]`, and `nums[2]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` is greater than 0. After executing `nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, `nums[3]` (since `i` is 3) is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
