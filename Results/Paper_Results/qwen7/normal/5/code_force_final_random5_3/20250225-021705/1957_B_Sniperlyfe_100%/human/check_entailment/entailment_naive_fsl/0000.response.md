Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n`. In such cases, it is not possible to distribute the value of `k` among `n` elements such that their bitwise OR is maximized. For example, consider the input:

```
1 1
```

The program will set `nums[0]` to `2^(1.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is `0` since `1.bit_length() - 1` is `0`. Then `k` becomes `1`, and `nums[0]` is updated to `1`. However, this does not satisfy the condition that the sum of the sequence equals `1`.

A correct approach would be to initialize all elements to `0` and then distribute `k` among the elements to maximize the bitwise OR. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(k):
        nums[i % n] += 1
    return nums
```

This version ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` and attempts to maximize the bitwise OR by setting as many elements as possible to `1`.
