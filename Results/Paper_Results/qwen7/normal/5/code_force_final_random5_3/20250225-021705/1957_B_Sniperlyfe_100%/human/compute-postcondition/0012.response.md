Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is decreased by `nums[1]`, `nums[1]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, `nums[2]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, and `k` is `k - nums[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= nums[i]` decrements `k` by the value of `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, it means `k` is decreased by `nums[2]`. However, from the initial state, we know that `nums[1]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, and `nums[2]` is also equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. Therefore, `k` is effectively decreased by `nums[2]`, which is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
