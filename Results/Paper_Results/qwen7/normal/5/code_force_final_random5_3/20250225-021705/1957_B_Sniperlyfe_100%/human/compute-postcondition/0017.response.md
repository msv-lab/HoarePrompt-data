Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is decreased by `nums[1] + nums[3]`, `nums[2]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, and `nums[3]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 3, `k` is decreased by `nums[1]`, `nums[2]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, and `nums[3]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. The code `k -= nums[i]` decrements `k` by the value of `nums[i]`, which is `nums[3]`. So, `k` is further decreased by `nums[3]`. The values of `i`, `nums[2]`, and `nums[3]` remain unchanged.
