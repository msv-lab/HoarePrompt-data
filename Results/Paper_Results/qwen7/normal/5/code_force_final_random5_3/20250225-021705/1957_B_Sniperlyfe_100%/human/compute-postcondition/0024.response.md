Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. Then, it sets the first element `nums[0]` to a specific value based on `k`. After that, it iterates through the list, setting each subsequent element to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`, until `k` is no longer positive. Finally, it adjusts `nums[0]` by adding any remaining value of `k`. The function returns the modified list `nums`, ensuring that `i` is set to `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 0.**
