Postcondition: `i` is either 3 or 1, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` contains the maximum value of `maxa` if the condition `foundb` is true and `founds` is also true, otherwise `b` contains the element `a[pb - 1]` or `p[pb - 1]`, and `pb` is equal to `p[pb - 1]` if the condition `a[pb - 1] == maxa` is met, otherwise `b` contains the element `p[pb - 1]`. Additionally, if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, then `s` is a list with the last element being `a[ps - 1]`; otherwise, `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`.
