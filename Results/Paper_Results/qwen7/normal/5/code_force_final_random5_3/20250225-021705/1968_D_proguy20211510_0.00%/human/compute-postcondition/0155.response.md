Output State: **`i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `ptsb` contains the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + (k - i - 1) * b[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` contains the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + (k - i - 1) * s[i]` for each `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`**.

Explanation: The code `maxs, maxb = max(ptss), max(ptsb)` calculates the maximum value in the `ptss` list and assigns it to `maxs`, and the maximum value in the `ptsb` list and assigns it to `maxb`. The values of `i`, `rem`, `ptsb`, and `ptss` remain unchanged from their previous states.
