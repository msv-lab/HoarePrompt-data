Postcondition: `n` is an integer value of the original `n` string, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `pb` is an integer value of the original `pb` string, `ps` is an integer value of the original `ps` string, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `p`. If `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are both equal to `maxa`, we continue the loop or process. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, then either `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `a[ps - 1]` or at least one of them is not equal to `maxa`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `a[pb - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, then `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa` if the condition `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise, the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `maxa`, `a[pb - 1]`, and `a[ps - 1]` remain unchanged.
