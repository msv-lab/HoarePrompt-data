Output State: **`rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `k - (i + 1)`. Given the initial state where `i` starts from 0, the value of `rem` becomes `k - (0 + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 1`. The state of `i` remains unchanged as it was initialized to 0. All other preconditions remain valid.
