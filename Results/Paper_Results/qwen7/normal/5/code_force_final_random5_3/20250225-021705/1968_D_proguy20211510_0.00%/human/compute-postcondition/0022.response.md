Based on the initial state provided:

- `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integer values derived from strings.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, split, and mapped to integers.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `p`.
- `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `a[ps - 1]`.
- Both `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are not equal to `maxa`.
- The current value of `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
