Output State: **`rem` is `k - i - 1`, `i` is 3, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0] + preb[3] + (k - i - 1) * b[3]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`, and `ptss` now includes the value `pres[3] + rem * s[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptss`. The new value is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, where `i` is 3 and `rem` is `k - i - 1`. Since `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to `pres[3] + (k - 3 - 1) * s[3]`, which further simplifies to `pres[3] + (k - 4) * s[3]`. This new value is appended to `ptss`. The other variables (`rem`, `i`, `ptsb`, and `ptss`) retain their previous values except for the updated `ptss`.
