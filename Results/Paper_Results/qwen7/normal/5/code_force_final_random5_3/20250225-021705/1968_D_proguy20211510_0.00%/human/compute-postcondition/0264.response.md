Output State: **`preb` has had its last element updated to `sb + b[i]`, `sb` and `b[i]` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of `sb` and `b[i]` to the list `preb`. Since the initial values of `sb` and `b[i]` are not specified, they are retained in their original form. The list `preb` has had its last element updated to the value of `sb + b[i]`.
