Output State: **`preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list**.

In the given code snippet, two lists `preb` and `pres` are initialized as empty lists. Since no other operations are performed on these lists, their values remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, after executing the code, both `preb` and `pres` are empty lists.
