Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` can be either True or False, `b` contains the value `maxa` (which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`).**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Given that `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, the list `b` now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
