Postcondition: `i` is either 4 or 2; `k` is greater than `i + 1`; `b` is a list with elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]` depending on whether `foundb` is true or false; `s` is a list with elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[ps - 1]`; `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `foundb` is True and `ps` remains unchanged; `foundb` is True if `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, otherwise `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.
