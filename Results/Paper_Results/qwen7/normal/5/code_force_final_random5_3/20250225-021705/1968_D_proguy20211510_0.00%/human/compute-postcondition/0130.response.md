Output State: **`preb` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `sb + b[i+1] + b[i]` and the second element is `sb + b[i]`; `pres` is a list containing one element which is `ss + s[i+1]`; `sb` is `sb + b[i+1] + b[i]`; `ss` is `ss + s[i+1]`; `s` must be a non-empty list and `i` must be less than the length of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` increments the value of `sb` by `b[i]`. Since `sb` was previously `sb + b[i+1]`, now it becomes `sb + b[i+1] + b[i]`. The other variables (`preb`, `pres`, `ss`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
