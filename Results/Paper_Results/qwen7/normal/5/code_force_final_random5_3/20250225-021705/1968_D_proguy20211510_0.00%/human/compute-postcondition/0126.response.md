Output State: **`preb` is a list containing one element which is `sb + b[i]`, `pres` is a list containing one element which is `ss + s[i]`, `sb` is `sb + b[i]`, `ss` is 0, `s` must be a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pres.append(ss + s[i])` appends the value of `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. Given the initial state, `ss` is 0, so the value appended to `pres` is simply `s[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
