Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 2; `k` is greater than `i + 1`; `b` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`**.

Explanation: The code appends a value to the list `b`. The value appended is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Since `i` can be either 4 or 2, and `k` must be greater than `i + 1`, the exact value of `k` is not specified, but it is known that it satisfies the condition `k > i + 1`. The value of `maxa` remains unchanged from its previous state.
