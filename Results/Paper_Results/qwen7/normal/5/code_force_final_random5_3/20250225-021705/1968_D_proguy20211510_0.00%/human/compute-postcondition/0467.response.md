Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by values of \(n\), \(k\), \(P_B\), \(P_S\), a permutation \(p\), and an array \(a\). For each test case, it determines the winner between Sasha and Bodya based on the values in \(a\) at indices \(P_B-1\) and \(P_S-1\). If these values are equal to the maximum value in \(a\), it prints "Draw". Otherwise, it calculates scores for both Sasha and Bodya over \(k\) rounds, updating the scores based on the maximum value in \(a\) and the permutation \(p\). Finally, it prints "Sasha" if her score is higher, "Bodya" if his score is higher, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.**
