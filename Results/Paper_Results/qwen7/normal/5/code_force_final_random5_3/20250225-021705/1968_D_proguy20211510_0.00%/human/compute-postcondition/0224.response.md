Output State: **`founds` and `foundb` remain `True`, `i` is `length_of_pres + 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 2`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are the same as before and the third element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are the same as before and the third element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.**

Explanation: The code appends `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the list `s`. Since `s` was previously a list containing two elements, now it contains three elements: the first two elements remain the same, and the third element is updated to `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
