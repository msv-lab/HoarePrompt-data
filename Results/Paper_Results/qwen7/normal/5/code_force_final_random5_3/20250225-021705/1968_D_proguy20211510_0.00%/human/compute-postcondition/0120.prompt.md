Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value of the original `n` string, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `pb` is an integer value of the original `pb` string, `ps` is an integer value of the original `ps` string, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `p`, `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are checked against `maxa`, and `founds` and `foundb` are set to `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 0, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` contains the elements `(k - 1) * maxa` and optionally `a[pb - 1]` depending on the condition, `s` contains the elements `(k - 2) * maxa` and possibly `a[ps - 1]`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `foundb` is True or False, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either 3 or 1, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` contains the maximum value of `maxa` if the condition `foundb` is true and `founds` is true, otherwise `b` contains the element `a[pb - 1]` or `p[pb - 1]`, and `pb` is equal to `p[pb - 1]` if the condition `a[pb - 1] == maxa` is met, otherwise `b` contains the element `p[pb - 1]`. Additionally, if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, then `s` is a list with the last element being `a[ps - 1]`; otherwise, `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either 4 or 2; `k` is greater than `i + 1`; `b` is a list with elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]` depending on whether `foundb` is true or false; `s` is a list with elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and either `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]` depending on the condition; `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `foundb` is True and `ps` remains unchanged; `foundb` is True if `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, otherwise `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
