Output State: `preb` is a list containing all the cumulative sums of the elements in `b` up to each index, `pres` is a list containing all the cumulative sums of the elements in `s` up to each index, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, and `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`.

In more detail:
- `preb` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `b` from the start to each index.
- `pres` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `s` from the start to each index.
- After the loop completes, `sb` will be equal to the sum of all elements in `b`.
- After the loop completes, `ss` will be equal to the sum of all elements in `s`.
