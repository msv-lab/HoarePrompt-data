Based on the initial state provided:

- `rem` is calculated as `k - len(pres)`.
- `i` is set to `len(pres)`.
- `ptsb` is the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(pres) - 1`.
- `ptss` is the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(pres) - 1`.
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
- It is also given that the maximum value in `ptss` is greater than the maximum value in `ptsb`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('Sasha')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string 'Sasha'. Since no other variables or objects are being printed, the output is solely determined by this statement.

Output: **Sasha**
