Output State: **`preb` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1] + b[i]`, the second element is `sb + b[i+1]`, and the third element is `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1] + b[i]`; `pres` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `ss + s[i+2]`, the second element is `ss + s[i+2] + s[i+1]`, and the third element is `ss + s[i+2] + s[i+1] + s[i]`; `sb` is `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1] + b[i]`; `ss` is `ss + s[i+2] + s[i+1] + s[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments the value of `ss` by the value of `s[i]`. Since `sb` is already defined as `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1] + b[i]`, and `preb` and `pres` lists are not directly affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. The updated value of `ss` includes the additional term `s[i]`.
