Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is False, `founds` can be either True or False, `a[pb - 1]` is now in list `b`, and `maxa` remains unchanged.**

The code appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Since `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa` (as per the initial state), the value of `maxa` does not change. All other variables remain in their initial states.
