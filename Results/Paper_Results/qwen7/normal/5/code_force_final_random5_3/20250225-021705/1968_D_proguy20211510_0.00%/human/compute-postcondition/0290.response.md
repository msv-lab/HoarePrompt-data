Output State: **`i` is 4, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[4] + rem * b[4] + preb[4] + rem * b[4]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[4] + rem * s[4]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptsb`. The new value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, which translates to `preb[4] + (k - i - 1) * b[4]`. Since `i` is 4, the updated value of `ptsb` becomes `preb[4] + rem * b[4] + preb[4] + rem * b[4]`. The values of `rem`, `ptsb`, and `ptss` remain as per their initial conditions, with `rem` being `k - i - 1` and `ptss` containing `pres[4] + rem * s[4]`.
