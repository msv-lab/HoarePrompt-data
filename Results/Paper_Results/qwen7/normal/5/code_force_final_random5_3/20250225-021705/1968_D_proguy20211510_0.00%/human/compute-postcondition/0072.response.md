Output State: **`i` is 3 or 1; `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string; `b` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `b`. The element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Since `i` can be either 3 or 1, and `k` is an integer, the exact value of the appended element depends on these values. However, the initial values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and `maxa` is assumed to be a previously defined variable. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the list `b`.
