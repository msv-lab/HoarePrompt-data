Output State: `preb` is a list containing the sum of `sb + b[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`, `pres` is a list containing the sum of `ss + s[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`, `sb` is equal to `sb + b[i]` where `i` is the last index of `s`, and `ss` is equal to `ss + s[i]` where `i` is the last index of `s`.

In simpler terms, `preb` will contain the cumulative sum of the `b` list up to each element, and `pres` will contain the cumulative sum of the `s` list up to each element. Both `sb` and `ss` will be equal to the total sum of their respective lists (`b` and `s`) after the loop has executed.
