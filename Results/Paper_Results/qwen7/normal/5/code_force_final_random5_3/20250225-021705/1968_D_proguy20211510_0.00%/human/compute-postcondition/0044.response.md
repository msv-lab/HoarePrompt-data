Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` contains the element `(k - 1) * maxa`, `s` contains the element `(k - 2) * maxa`, `foundb` is True, and the value of `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code sets `foundb` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
