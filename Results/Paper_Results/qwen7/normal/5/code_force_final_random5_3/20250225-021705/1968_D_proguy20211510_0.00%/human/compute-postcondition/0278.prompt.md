Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is `k`, `rem` is 0, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing `k` elements, each of which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `s` is a list containing `k` elements, each of which is `maxa` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1]` otherwise, with `ps` updated accordingly during the loop iterations; `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    preb.append(sb + b[i])
    sb += b[i]
    pres.append(ss + s[i])
    ss += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `preb` has had its last element updated to `sb + b[i]`, `sb` is now equal to `sb + b[i]`, `pres` has the new element `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is now equal to `ss + s[i]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `preb` has its last element updated to `sb + b[i]`, `sb` is now equal to `sb + b[i]`, `pres` has the new element `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is now equal to `ss + s[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `preb` has a new element `sb + b[i]` with `ss += s[i]` updating `ss` to `ss + s[i]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`, `preb` includes the appended value `sb + b[i + 1]` and now equals `sb + b[i + 1]`, `pres` includes the appended value `ss + s[i]` and now equals `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
