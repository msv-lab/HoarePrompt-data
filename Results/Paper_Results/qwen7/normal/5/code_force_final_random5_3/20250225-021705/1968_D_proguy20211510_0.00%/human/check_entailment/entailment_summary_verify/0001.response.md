### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several issues with the program's logic, particularly in how it simulates the game and calculates the final scores. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program checks if `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are both equal to the maximum value in `a`. If they are, it prints 'Draw'.
   - If only one of them is equal to the maximum value, it prints 'Bodya' or 'Sasha' accordingly.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The program initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It then iterates through `k` turns, updating the positions and scores for both players.
     - For Bodya, it checks if `foundb` is true. If not, it updates `b` with the current score and moves to the next position in the permutation.
     - Similarly, for Sasha, it checks if `founds` is true. If not, it updates `s` with the current score and moves to the next position in the permutation.
   - After the loop, it calculates the total scores for both players using the accumulated scores and the remaining turns.

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the final scores for both players using the accumulated scores and the remaining turns.
   - It then compares the final scores and prints the result accordingly.

### Detailed Evaluation

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The initial checks correctly handle the scenario where both players start at positions with the maximum value in `a`, resulting in a draw.
   - The checks also correctly identify when one player starts at a position with the maximum value, leading to a clear winner.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - The simulation logic is flawed because it assumes that the players will always choose the maximum value in `a` for their scores, which is not necessarily true. The players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the next position in the permutation based on the values in `a` and their strategic choices.
   - The program does not account for the optimal strategy of the players. For example, if a player can achieve a higher score by moving to a different position, the current logic does not capture this.

3. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The final score calculation is based on the assumption that the players will always choose the maximum value in `a` for their scores, which is not necessarily true. The players can choose to stay or move based on the values in `a` and the positions they are at.
   - The program does not simulate the entire game correctly, as it does not consider all possible moves and strategies that the players might use.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the logic for simulating the game and calculating the final scores, the program is not correct. The program does not account for the optimal strategy of the players and incorrectly assumes that the players will always choose the maximum value in `a` for their scores.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
