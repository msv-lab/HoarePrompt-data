Output State: **`preb` has had its last element updated to `sb + b[i]`, `sb` is now equal to `sb + b[i]`, `pres` has the new element `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is now equal to `ss + s[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments the value of `ss` by `s[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
