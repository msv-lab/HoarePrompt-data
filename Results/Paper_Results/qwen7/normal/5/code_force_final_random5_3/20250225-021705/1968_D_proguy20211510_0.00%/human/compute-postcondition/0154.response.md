Output State: `i` is `len(pres)` (which is also the length of `preb`); `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`; `ptsb` contains the sum of `preb[i] + (k - i - 1) * b[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`; `ptss` contains the sum of `pres[i] + (k - i - 1) * s[i]` for each `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `pres` (and `preb`), meaning the loop has processed every element in these lists. The `ptsb` list will contain the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + (k - i - 1) * b[i]` for each iteration, starting from `i=0` up to `i=len(pres)-1`. Similarly, the `ptss` list will contain the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + (k - i - 1) * s[i]` for each iteration, starting from `i=1` up to `i=len(pres)-1`.
