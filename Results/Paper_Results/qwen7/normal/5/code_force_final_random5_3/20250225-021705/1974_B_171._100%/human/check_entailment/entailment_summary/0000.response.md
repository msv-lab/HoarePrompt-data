Reasoning:
1. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.
3. The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string:
   - It first finds all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of the sorted unique characters.
   - It then decodes the encoded string by replacing each character with its mapped character from `char_map`.
4. The program prints the decoded string for each test case.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to follow the correct logic for decoding the string. The steps taken in the `func_1` function match the required encoding process but applied in reverse for decoding.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
