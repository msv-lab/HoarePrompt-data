Let's break down the solution step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`, which is an efficient way to handle large inputs.
   - It then splits the input into parts using `split()`.
   - The variable `t` is set to the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with the encoded string `b`.
   - The function `func_1` processes the encoded string to produce the decoded string.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It first extracts the unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It creates a mapping where each character in the sorted unique list is paired with its corresponding symmetric character from the end of the list.
   - It then uses this mapping to decode the encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its mapped value.

4. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The logic to create the mapping and decode the string is correct and aligns with the problem statement.
   - The steps to extract unique characters, sort them, and create the symmetric mapping are implemented correctly.
   - The decoding process by joining the mapped characters is also correct.

### Verification:

- The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
- The function `func_1` correctly decodes the string by following the specified rules.
- The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

Given that the program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement, it should work as intended for all valid inputs.

**Correctness: True**
