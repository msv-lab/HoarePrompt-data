Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. The `func_1` function is designed to decode the encoded string by creating a mapping of characters from the original string `s` to the encoded string `b`.
3. The function first extracts the unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
4. It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of the sorted list of unique characters.
5. Finally, it uses this dictionary to decode the encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its mapped character from the dictionary.
6. The logic and implementation of the function match the problem description accurately, ensuring that the original string can be correctly restored from the encoded string.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states.

Correctness: **True**
