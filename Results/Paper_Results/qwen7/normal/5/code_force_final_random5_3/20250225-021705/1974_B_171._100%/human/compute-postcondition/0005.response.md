Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The condition for the loop is `range(len_unique)`, which means `i` will iterate from 0 to `len_unique - 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `len_unique` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `char_map[unique_chars[i]]` is assigned the value of `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute one more time if it can.
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `len_unique` must still be greater than 0 (which it is, as per the current state).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - The assignment `char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]` will be updated to reflect the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `len_unique` must still be greater than 0.
- `i` will be 1.
- `char_map[unique_chars[i]]` will be assigned the value of `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`, which is now `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - 1]` or `unique_chars[len_unique - 2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`len_unique` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `char_map[unique_chars[i]]` is assigned the value of `unique_chars[len_unique - 2]`**.
