Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `len_unique`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**:
   - `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.
   - `unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`.
   - `char_map` is an empty dictionary.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len_unique`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The variable `i` starts at 0 (the initial value of `i` in a `range` function).
   - The variable `len_unique` should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `len_unique` is greater than 0 and `i` starts at 0.

**Final State**:
- `len_unique` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`len_unique` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
