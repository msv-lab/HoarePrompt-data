Output State: `len_unique` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `len_unique`; for every index `j` in `unique_chars`, `char_map[unique_chars[j]]` is assigned the value of `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `len_unique` will still be greater than 0 (as long as there were unique characters in `encoded` to begin with). The variable `i` will be equal to `len_unique` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `len_unique`. The dictionary `char_map` will contain mappings for each character in `unique_chars` such that each character `unique_chars[j]` maps to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]`. In other words, each character in `unique_chars` will map to its corresponding character from the end of the list, effectively creating a mirrored mapping.
