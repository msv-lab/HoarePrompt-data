Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and then processes it. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it extracts the necessary information (length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself) and passes it to the `func_1` function for decoding.

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - **Extracting Unique Characters**: It first extracts all unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - **Mapping Characters**: It creates a mapping where each character in the sorted list is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character.
   - **Decoding**: Using the mapping, it decodes the encoded string by replacing each character according to the mapping.

4. **Output**: The decoded strings are collected and printed one by one.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program works as expected and produces the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
