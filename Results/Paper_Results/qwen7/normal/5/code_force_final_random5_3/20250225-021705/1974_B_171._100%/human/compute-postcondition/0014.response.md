Functionality: **The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `decoded`. Each character in `decoded` is mapped according to a dictionary `char_map`, where each unique character in `encoded` is paired with its corresponding character from the end of the unique character list. This results in a mirrored mapping of characters in the output string.**
