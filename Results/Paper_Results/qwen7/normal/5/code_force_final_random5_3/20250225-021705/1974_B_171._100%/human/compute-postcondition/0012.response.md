Output State: **The program returns a string `decoded` where each character is mapped according to the `char_map` dictionary. The mapping is such that for every index `j` in `unique_chars`, `char_map[unique_chars[j]]` is assigned the value of `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]`.**

This means that the `decoded` string is constructed by reversing the order of characters in `unique_chars` and using them as keys in `char_map` to find their corresponding values, which form the characters of the `decoded` string.
