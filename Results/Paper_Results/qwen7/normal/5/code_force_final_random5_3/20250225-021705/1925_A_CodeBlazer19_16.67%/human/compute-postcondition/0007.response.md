Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is the string 'aa', `j` is 98**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` (which is 98, corresponding to the letter 'b') to the string `s`. Since `s` initially contains the character 'a', after executing the code, `s` becomes 'aa'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged.
