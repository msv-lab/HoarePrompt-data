Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is the string 'aaaaaaaaa', `j` is 105.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 97` to `j = k + 97 - 1`. Given that the loop executes 3 times as per the provided states, we can infer that `k` must be 104 because the loop increments `j` from 97 to 98, 99, and then 100 (which is `k + 97 - 1`). Therefore, after the loop completes all its iterations, `s` will contain the string 'aaaaaaaaa' (9 characters long, starting from 'a' to 'j'), and `j` will be 105, being the next character after the last iteration of the loop.
