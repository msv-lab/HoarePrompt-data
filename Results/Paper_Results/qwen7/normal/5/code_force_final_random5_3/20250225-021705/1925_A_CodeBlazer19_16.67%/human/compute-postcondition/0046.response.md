Output State: `j` is 296, `k` is at least 102, `s` is the string consisting of characters from ASCII values 199 to 295.

Explanation: The loop runs for each value of `j` in the range from 97 to `k + 97`. Given that the loop executes fully, `j` will reach its maximum value, which is `k + 97`. Since `k` is at least 102 and `i` starts at 200, `k + 97` will be at least 299. Therefore, `j` will be 296 after the loop completes. The string `s` will contain characters from ASCII values 199 to 295, inclusive, because the loop increments `j` starting from 97 up to `k + 97`, and it appends the corresponding ASCII character to `s` in each iteration.
