Output State: `j` is 199, `k` must be greater than 97, `s` is the string 'iuðŸ˜€'.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 97` to `j = k + 96`. Given that the output state after 3 iterations shows `j` as 107, it means `k` must be at least 9 (since `j` starts at 97 and increases by 1 each iteration). After 97 iterations (which is the maximum possible since `j` goes up to `k + 97` and we start from 97), `j` would be `97 + 97 - 1 = 199`. At this point, `s` would contain the characters 'i', 'u', and the Unicode character for the smiling face emoji (U+1F600) because it was added in the third iteration.
