Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is the first integer input by the user.
   - `k` is the second integer input by the user.
   - `s` is the string 'aaaaaaaaa'.
   - `j` is 105.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`. Since `i` starts at 0 and is incremented within the loop, the loop will continue if `i` is less than `t`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, `i` becomes 1.
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is determined by the first integer input by the user and does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains the same (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n`, `k`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is the string 'aaaaaaaaa', `j` is 105**.
