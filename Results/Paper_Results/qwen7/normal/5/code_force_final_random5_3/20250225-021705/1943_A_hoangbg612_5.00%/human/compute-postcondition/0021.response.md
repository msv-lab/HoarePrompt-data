Output State: **`N` must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is `cur` + 1, and `M[cur]` is updated accordingly.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. The other variables (`N`, `num`, and `M[cur]`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `cur` is now one more than its previous value, while `N`, `num`, and the update to `M[cur]` remain as they were before the code was executed.
