Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cur` will be the largest element in `N`, `M[cur]` will be 1, and all other elements in `M` will be 0 or incremented based on their occurrence in `N`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the sorted list `N`. For each element `num` in `N`:
- If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it means `num` is a new candidate for `cur` and `cur` is updated to `num`, setting `M[num]` to 1.
- If `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`, `num` is not a new candidate, so `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

Since `N` is sorted, once `cur` is set to the largest element in `N`, no further updates to `cur` will occur because any subsequent elements in `N` will not satisfy `num > cur + 1`. Therefore, the final value of `cur` will be the largest element in `N`, and `M[cur]` will be 1, indicating that `cur` appears exactly once in `N`. All other entries in `M` will be 0 or incremented based on their occurrences in `N` before they were replaced by a larger element or remained as they were.
