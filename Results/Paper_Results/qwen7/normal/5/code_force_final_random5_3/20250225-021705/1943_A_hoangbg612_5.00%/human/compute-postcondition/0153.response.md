Output State: **`cur` is -1, `i` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces without its last element, `M` is a dictionary with key -1 and value 2, and `num` is the second-to-last element of `N`.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[-1]` by 1. Since `M[-1]` was initially 1, after executing the code, `M[-1]` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
