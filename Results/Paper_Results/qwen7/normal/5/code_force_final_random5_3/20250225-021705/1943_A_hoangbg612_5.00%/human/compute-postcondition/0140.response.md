Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `i` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value 1, and either `num` is the last element of `N` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `num` is not greater than `cur + 1` and no change is made to `cur` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition about `num` being the last element of `N` or not being greater than `cur + 1` remains the same.
