Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `cur` will be the maximum value in the list `N`, `M[cur]` will be 1, and all other entries in `M` will be 0. The variable `i` will retain its last incremented value, which is `len(N) - 1`, and `S` will remain unchanged as it was not involved in the loop operations.

In simpler terms, after running through all elements in the list `N`, `cur` will hold the highest number found in `N`, and `M` will have an entry with `cur` as the key and a value of 1, indicating that `cur` was the highest number encountered. All other keys in `M` will have a value of 0. The index `i` will be set to the length of `N` minus one, and `S` will stay as it was initially.
