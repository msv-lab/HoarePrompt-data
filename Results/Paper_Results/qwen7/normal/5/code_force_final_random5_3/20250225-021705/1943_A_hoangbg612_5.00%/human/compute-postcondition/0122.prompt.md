Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After executing the if statement, `cur` will hold the highest number found in `N`, `M[cur]` will be 1, and all other entries in `M` will be 0. The variable `i` will retain its last incremented value, which is `len(N) - 1`, and `S` will remain unchanged as it was not involved in the loop operations. The sum of all values in `M` is equal to `S`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is less than `cur`, `cur` remains the highest number found in `N`, `S` remains unchanged, and the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `cur + 1`, `cur` becomes `i`, `S` remains unchanged, and if `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is incremented by 1, `S` remains unchanged, and if `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
