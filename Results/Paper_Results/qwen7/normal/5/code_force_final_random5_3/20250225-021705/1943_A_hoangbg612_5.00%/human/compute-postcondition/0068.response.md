Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for num in N:`. The variables involved here are `num` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `cur` is -1 (not used in the loop head).
   - `i` is -2 (not used in the loop head).
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `S` is an input integer (not used in the loop head).
   - `M` is an empty dictionary (not used in the loop head).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `N`. For the loop to execute, `N` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `N` is the only variable directly involved in the loop head, we need to ensure that `N` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `N` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`N` must contain at least one element**
