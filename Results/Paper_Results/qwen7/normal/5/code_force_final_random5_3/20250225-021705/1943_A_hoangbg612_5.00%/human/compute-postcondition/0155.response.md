Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is defined as `for num in N:`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `num`.

2. **Determine the current state of `num`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the second-to-last element of `N` or -1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `num` must be the last element of `N`.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since `num` is currently the second-to-last element of `N` or -1, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the last element of `N`.

Given this analysis, we can update the state as follows:

- `cur` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `i` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `S` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `T` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `N` must now include its last element, making `num` the last element of `N`.
- `M` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `num` must now be the last element of `N`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`cur` is either the second-to-last element of `N` or -1, `i` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces (now including its last element), `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value either `1` or `2`, and `num` is the last element of `N`**.
