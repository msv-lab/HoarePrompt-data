Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `N` must have at least one element.
- If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is set to `num`, and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `N`.

### Adjusting the States
1. **Variable `num`:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `N`, the value of `num` changes with each iteration. The specific value of `num` depends on the current element being processed in the loop.

2. **Variable `cur`:**
   - The value of `cur` can change if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. In that case, `cur` is updated to `num`.
   - Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

3. **Variable `M`:**
   - The dictionary `M` is updated based on the value of `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
- At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume the following:
  - `num` was some value, say `x`.
  - `cur` was some value, say `y`.
  - `M[y]` was updated accordingly (either set to 1 or incremented).

- For the next iteration:
  - `num` will now be the next element in `N`.
  - `cur` will either remain `y` or be updated to the new `num` if the condition `num > cur + 1` is met.
  - `M[cur]` will be updated based on the new value of `cur`.

### Updated State
- `N` still has at least one element (since it must always have at least one element).
- `num` will be the next element in `N`.
- `cur` will be either the same as the previous `cur` or the new `num` if the condition is met.
- `M[cur]` will be updated accordingly.

### Final State
Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`N` must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is either the same as the previous `cur` or the new `num` if the condition is met, and `M[cur]` is updated accordingly.**

To provide a concrete example, if the previous `num` was 5, `cur` was 3, and `M[3]` was incremented, the next state would be:

State: **`N` must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is either 3 or the new `num` if the condition is met, and `M[cur]` is updated accordingly.**

However, since the exact values depend on the current state of `N`, `cur`, and `M`, the general form of the state is:

State: **`N` must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is either the same as the previous `cur` or the new `num` if the condition is met, and `M[cur]` is updated accordingly.**
