Output State: **`N` must have at least one element, and the first element of `N` is less than or equal to `num`; `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Since no specific value was given for `cur`, we cannot specify the exact value of `M[cur]` after the increment, but we know it has been incremented. The precondition that `N` must have at least one element and the first element of `N` is less than or equal to `num` remains unchanged.
