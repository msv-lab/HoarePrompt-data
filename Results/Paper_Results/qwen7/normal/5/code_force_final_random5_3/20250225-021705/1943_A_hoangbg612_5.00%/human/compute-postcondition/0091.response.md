Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `N`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `cur` is now equal to `num`, `N` must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`, and `M[cur]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `num` is greater than `cur`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `num` is the next element in `N`, for the loop to execute again, `N` must still contain at least one element, and `num` will be the next element in `N`.
   - `cur` will be updated to the new value of `num` for the next iteration.
   - `M[cur]` will be either incremented by 1 or set to 1 based on the comparison with the new `num`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `N` must still contain at least one element.
- `num` will be the next element in `N`.
- `cur` will be updated to this new `num`.
- `M[cur]` will be either incremented by 1 or set to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cur` is the next element in `N`, `N` must contain at least one element, `M[cur]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `num` is greater than `cur`**. 

However, since `num` is the next element in `N` and `cur` will be updated to `num`, we can simplify it to:
State: **`cur` is the next element in `N`, `N` must contain at least one element, and `M[cur]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `num` is greater than `cur`**.

To make it clear and concise:
State: **`cur` is the next element in `N`, `N` must contain at least one element, and `M[cur]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `num` is greater than `cur`**.
