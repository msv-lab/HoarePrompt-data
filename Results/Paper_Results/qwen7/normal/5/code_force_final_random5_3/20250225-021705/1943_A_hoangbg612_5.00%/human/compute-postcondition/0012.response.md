Postcondition: `N` must have at least one element, the current value of `num` is greater than the current value of `cur` plus 1. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `num > cur + 1` is not met, the values of `num` and `cur` remain unchanged.
