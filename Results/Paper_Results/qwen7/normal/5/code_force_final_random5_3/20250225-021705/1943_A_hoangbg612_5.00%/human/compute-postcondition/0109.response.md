Output State: **`i` is assigned the value of `cur`, which is less than `cur`, `cur` remains the highest number found in `N`, `S` remains unchanged, and the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.**

This means that `i` is now set to the value of `cur`, but since `cur` is the highest number found in `N`, `i` is still less than `cur`. The values of `cur`, `S`, and the current value of `M[i]` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
