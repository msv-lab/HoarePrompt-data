Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the MEX of the array \( c \) formed during the game.
2. The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. Specifically:
   - Alice and Bob have different rules for picking elements.
   - Alice can pick any element from the array \( a \), append it to \( c \), and remove it from \( a \).
   - Bob can only pick an element from \( a \) and remove it without appending it to \( c \).
3. The current implementation sorts the array \( N \) and then tries to find the maximum value \( cur \) that meets certain conditions. This approach does not accurately reflect the game's rules or the objective of maximizing/minimizing the MEX.
4. The logic for determining the MEX is flawed because it does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob and their respective strategies.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the game's rules and logic for finding the MEX. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
