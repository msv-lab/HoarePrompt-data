Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `cur + 1`
   - `cur` becomes `i`
   - `S` remains unchanged
   - If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(cur):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `cur - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `cur + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `0` to `cur - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` should be `cur`.
   - `cur` becomes `i` at the end of each iteration, so `cur` will be `cur + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `S` remains unchanged as per the given information.
   - The condition `if M[i] <= i` needs to be checked again with the new value of `i`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be `cur` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `cur` will become `i` (so `cur` will be `cur + 1`).
   - `S` remains unchanged.
   - The condition `if M[i] <= i` will be checked with `i = cur`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `cur`, `cur` is `cur + 1`, `S` remains unchanged, and if `M[cur]` is less than or equal to `cur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
