Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition is `i in range(cur)`.
   - This means the loop will iterate from `0` to `cur-1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is assigned the value of `cur` (which is less than the current `cur`).
   - `cur` remains the highest number found in `N`.
   - `S` remains unchanged.
   - The current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `cur + 1`.
   - `cur` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `S` remains unchanged.
   - The current value of `M[i]` (which is now `M[cur + 1]`) needs to be considered. However, since we don't know the exact value of `M[cur + 1]`, we can only say that it should be consistent with the previous state where `M[i]` was less than or equal to `i`.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` will be `cur + 1`.
   - `cur` remains the same.
   - `S` remains unchanged.
   - `M[cur + 1]` should be less than or equal to `cur + 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `cur + 1`, `cur` remains the highest number found in `N`, `S` remains unchanged, and the current value of `M[i]` (which is `M[cur + 1]`) is less than or equal to `cur + 1`**.
