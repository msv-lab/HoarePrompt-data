Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2⋅10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `N.sort()` sorts the list `N` in ascending order. The values of `T` and `S` remain unchanged. Therefore, `T` is still greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2⋅10^4, and `S` remains an input integer. The list `N` is updated to be a sorted version of its original state.
