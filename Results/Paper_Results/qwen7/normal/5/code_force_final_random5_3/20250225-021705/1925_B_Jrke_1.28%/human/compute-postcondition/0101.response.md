Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `i`, and the expressions used to determine the range of `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i <= int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - The loop increments `i` by 2 each time.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**:
   - If `x % 2 == 0`, then `i` starts at 1 + 1 = 2.
   - If `x % 2 != 0`, then `i` starts at 1.

4. **Determine the upper limit of `i`**:
   - The upper limit is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue based on the given conditions.
   - `i` should start at either 1 or 2 depending on whether `x` is even or odd.
   - `i` should not exceed `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should start at either 1 or 2.
- `i` should not exceed `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Since `x` and `n` are inputs from the user, their values directly influence the starting point and the upper limit of `i`. However, `k`, `l`, and `ans` are derived from `x` and `n`, and they do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is the upper limit for `i`**.
