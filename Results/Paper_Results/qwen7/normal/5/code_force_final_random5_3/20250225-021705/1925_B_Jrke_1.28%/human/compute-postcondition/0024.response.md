Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The condition for the loop is based on `x` and `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop starts from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`.
   - This means if `x` is even, the loop starts from 1; otherwise, it starts from 2.
   - The loop increments by 2 each time (`i += 2`).
   - The loop ends when `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and any integer `i` such that `x` is divisible by `i`.
   - `l` is a list containing `ans`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last value checked.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 2.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

5. **Check the conditions for the next iteration:**
   - If `x` is even, the next `i` should start from 3 (since the previous `i` was 1).
   - If `x` is odd, the next `i` should start from 3 (since the previous `i` was 2).

6. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `ans` remains the same unless a new valid `i` is found.
   - `l` remains the same.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`x` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and any integer `i` such that `x` is divisible by `i`, and `l` is a list containing `ans`. The loop will start with the next `i` which is `i + 2` and check if it is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.**

To be more specific, if `i` was the last value checked, the next `i` would be `i + 2`. 

So, the final state is:

State: **`x` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and any integer `i` such that `x` is divisible by `i`, and `l` is a list containing `ans`. The loop will start with the next `i` which is `i + 2`.**
