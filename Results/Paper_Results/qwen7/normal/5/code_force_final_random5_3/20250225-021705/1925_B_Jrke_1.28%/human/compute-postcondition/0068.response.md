Postcondition: `x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `start` is 2 if `x` is even or 1 if `x` is odd, and `start` must be less than or equal to `stop`; `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, where `l` contains the elements `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x // i` is added to the list `l`.
