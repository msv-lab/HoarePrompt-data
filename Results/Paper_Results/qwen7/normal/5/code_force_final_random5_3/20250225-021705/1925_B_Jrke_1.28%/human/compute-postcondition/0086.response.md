Output State: **`l` is a list containing `ans`, `i-2`, and the result of `x // (i-2)`, and `i` is the previous value of `i` + 2.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Before the code execution, `l` contains `ans` and `i` is the previous value of `i` + 2. After appending `x // i` to `l`, `l` now contains `ans`, `i-2`, and `x // (i-2)`. The value of `i` is updated to the previous value of `i` + 2.
