Postcondition: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is `x // n`, `l` contains the maximum divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, and `ans` is the maximum value in `l`. This remains true regardless of the value of `k`, as there is no else part in the code and the if part does not change the variables' values.**
