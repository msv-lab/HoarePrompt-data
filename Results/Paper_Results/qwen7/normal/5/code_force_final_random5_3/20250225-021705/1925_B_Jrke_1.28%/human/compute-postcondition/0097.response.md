Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is an integer input from the user.
- `n` is an integer input from the user.
- `k` is calculated as `x // n`, which means `k` is the quotient when `x` is divided by `n`.
- `l` contains the maximum divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`.
- `ans` is the maximum value in `l`.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
