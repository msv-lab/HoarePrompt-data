Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 1, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The program continues with the next iteration of the loop.
