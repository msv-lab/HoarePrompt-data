Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( x \) and \( n \). It calculates the maximum divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to \( \frac{x}{n} \) (if \( \frac{x}{n} \geq 1 \)), and prints this value. If \( \frac{x}{n} < 1 \), it directly prints 1. The function implicitly accepts three variables \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \) across multiple test cases, where \( t \) is the number of test cases, and for each test case, \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^8 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq x \).**
