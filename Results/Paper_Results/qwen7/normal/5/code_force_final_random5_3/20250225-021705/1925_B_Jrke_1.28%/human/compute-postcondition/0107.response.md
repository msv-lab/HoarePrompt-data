Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `x` is an integer such that the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`; `l` is a list containing two elements which are `ans` and `i`, and `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains one element `ans`. After appending `i`, `l` now contains two elements: `ans` and `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
