Output State: **The `char_map` dictionary contains key-value pairs where each key is a unique element from the sorted list `b`, and the value for each key is a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. Here, `i` is the index of the current element in the loop, starting from 0.**

This means that if `b` has `n` unique elements, the `char_map` will map each unique element to a character starting from `chr(ord('a') + (n-1))` down to `chr(ord('a'))`.
