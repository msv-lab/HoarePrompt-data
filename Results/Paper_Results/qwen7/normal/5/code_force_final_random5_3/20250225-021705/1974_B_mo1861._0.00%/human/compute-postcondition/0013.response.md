Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `char_map` is unchanged.
  - `s` is now equal to `char_map[c]`.
  - `c` is the first element of `b`.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for c in b:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `c` is taken from the iterable `b`.
   - The loop does not directly modify `s` or `char_map` within its body (since the body is omitted).

2. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - In the next iteration, `c` will be the next element in the iterable `b`.
   - Since `c` is the first element of `b` in the current iteration, the next element in `b` will be the second element.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - `char_map` remains unchanged.
   - `s` will be updated to `char_map[next_c]`, where `next_c` is the next element in `b`.
   - `c` will be set to the next element in `b`.

### Conclusion:
- The state needs to be adjusted such that `c` is now the second element of `b`, and `s` is updated to `char_map` of this new `c`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`char_map` is unchanged, `s` is now equal to `char_map[next_c]`, `c` is the second element of `b`**, where `next_c` is the second element in `b`.
