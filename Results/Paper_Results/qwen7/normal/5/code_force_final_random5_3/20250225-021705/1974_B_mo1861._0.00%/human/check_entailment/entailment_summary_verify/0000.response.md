### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness:** False.
- **Explanation:** The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. Specifically, the issue lies in how the `char_map` is constructed. The mapping should pair each character in the sorted unique set of characters in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding symmetric character. However, the current implementation incorrectly maps characters to their symmetric positions.

#### Analysis:
1. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character in the encoded string `b` is mapped to a corresponding character based on its position in `b`.
   - The mapping is done such that each character is paired with its symmetric counterpart in the sorted unique set of characters.

2. **Current Implementation:**
   - The current implementation uses `ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1)` to map characters, which is incorrect because it converts the characters to their ASCII values and then back to characters, which does not reflect the symmetric mapping described in the problem.

3. **Corrected Implementation:**
   - The corrected implementation should directly map each character to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted unique set of characters.
   - The corrected code snippet provided in the original assessment is:
     ```python
     def func_1(b):
         """
         Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

         Args:
             b (str): The encoded string.

         Returns:
             str: The decoded string s.
         """
         char_map = {}
         unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
         for i in range(len(unique_chars)):
             char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[~i]
         s = ''
         for c in b:
             s += char_map.get(c, '')  # Use get to handle cases where the character is not found
         return s
     ```

4. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the corrected implementation with the example provided:
     - Encoded string: `b = "serofedsoc"`
     - Unique characters: `c, d, e, f, o, r, s`
     - Sorted unique characters: `c, d, e, f, o, r, s`
     - Symmetric mapping:
       - `c` -> `s`
       - `d` -> `r`
       - `e` -> `e`
       - `f` -> `f`
       - `o` -> `o`
       - `r` -> `d`
       - `s` -> `c`
     - Decoded string: `codeforces`

   - The corrected implementation correctly maps each character to its symmetric counterpart and produces the correct decoded string.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program was indeed incorrect due to the flawed construction of the `char_map`. The corrected implementation provided in the original assessment fixes this issue and correctly decodes the encoded strings.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
