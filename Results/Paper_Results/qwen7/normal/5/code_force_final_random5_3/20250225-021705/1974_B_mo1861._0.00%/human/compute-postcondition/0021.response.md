Functionality: **The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and decodes it using a character mapping. It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character in `b` is mapped to a corresponding character based on its position in `b`. Then, it constructs a new string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding value from `char_map`. Finally, it returns the decoded string `s`.**
