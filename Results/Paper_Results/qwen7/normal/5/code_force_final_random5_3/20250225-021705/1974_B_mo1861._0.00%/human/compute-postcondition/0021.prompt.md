You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of b is at most 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that b is the result of encoding some string s according to the given algorithm.
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
        
    #State: The `char_map` dictionary contains key-value pairs where each key is a unique element from the sorted list `b`, and the value for each key is a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. Here, `i` is the index of the current element in the loop, starting from 0.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: Output State: `char_map` remains unchanged, `s` is updated to include the concatenated values from `char_map` corresponding to all elements of `b`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `s` will contain a string where each character from the list `b` has been replaced by its corresponding value in the `char_map` dictionary, with all these replacements concatenated together into a single string. The `char_map` dictionary itself does not change during the loop.
    return s
    #The program returns a string `s` which is the concatenation of the values from `char_map` corresponding to all elements in list `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `b`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a maximum length of 2 * 10^5. The function returns a string `s` which is the concatenation of the values from `char_map` corresponding to all elements in list `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string `s` which is the concatenation of the values from `char_map` corresponding to all elements in list `b`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
