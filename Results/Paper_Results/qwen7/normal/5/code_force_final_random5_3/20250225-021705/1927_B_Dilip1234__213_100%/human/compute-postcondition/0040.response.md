Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 4, `n` is 26, `s` is 'bab...zAbb', `char_count[3]` is 28**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends a character to the string `s`. Here, `j` is 4, so `chr(j + ord('a'))` evaluates to `chr(4 + 97)` which is `chr(101)`, and `101` corresponds to the character 'e'. Therefore, the string `s` is updated by appending 'e' to it, making it `'bab...zAbb'`. The other variables remain unchanged.
