Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 1; `n` is a positive integer; `s` is 'b'; `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends a character to the string `s`. Here, `j` is initially 0, so `chr(j + ord('a'))` evaluates to `chr(0 + ord('a'))`, which is `'a'`. However, since `j` is incremented after the operation (though not shown in the snippet), `j` becomes 1, and `chr(j + ord('a'))` now evaluates to `'b'`. Thus, `s` becomes `'b'`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `char_count[j]` is still equal to `a[i]` because no changes were made to these variables within the given snippet.
