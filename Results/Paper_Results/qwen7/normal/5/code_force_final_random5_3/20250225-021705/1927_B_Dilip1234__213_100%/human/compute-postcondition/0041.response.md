Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 4, `n` is 26, `s` is 'bab...zAbb', `char_count[3]` is 29**.

The code increments the value of `char_count[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 4, `char_count[4]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `char_count[3]` was 28. Since `j` is 4, which is one index higher, `char_count[4]` is now 28 + 1 = 29. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
