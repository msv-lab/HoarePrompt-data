Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
   - The variable `n` must be a positive integer, as given in the state before the loop starts.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we need to set `i` to 0.
   - The value of `n` must be a positive integer, which is already given in the state before the loop starts.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 0 and `n` to ensure it is a positive integer (which is already stated).

Therefore, the modified state should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
