Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was in the initial state, which is an integer between 1 and 5000.
