Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index.
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder and doesn't hold any specific value, we don't need to adjust its state.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute based on the input from `int(input())`.
   - This means the loop will run as long as the input is a positive integer.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - Given: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), and `p` is a list of `n` integers where each \(p_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as the input is a valid integer within the specified range.
   - Therefore, the initial state of `t` should be within the given range to ensure the loop can execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)**
