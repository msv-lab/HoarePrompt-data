The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i <= n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i <= n - 1` must be true.

Given `i` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 (since `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`, and `n - 1` must be at least 4 to satisfy the condition when `i` is 3).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
