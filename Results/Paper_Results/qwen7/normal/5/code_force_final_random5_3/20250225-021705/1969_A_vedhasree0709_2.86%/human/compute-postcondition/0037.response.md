Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is the new input integer.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `j` is 0.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= n - 1` must be true.
   - Currently, `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Consider additional constraints**:
   - The problem does not mention any specific constraints on `t`, `l`, or `j` for the loop to execute the first time. Hence, no adjustments are needed for these variables.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure that `i <= n - 1` is true.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0**
