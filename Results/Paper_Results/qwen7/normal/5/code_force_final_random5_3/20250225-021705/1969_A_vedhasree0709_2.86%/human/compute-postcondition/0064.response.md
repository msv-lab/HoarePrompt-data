Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is equal to `n`
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 4
   - `l` is a list of integers
   - `j` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer. Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, it implies that the loop has already run `n` times. For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states**: Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())` itself. It must be a positive integer greater than 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` is equal to `n`
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)
- `n` is greater than or equal to 4
- `l` is a list of integers
- `j` is 0
- `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0

However, since we are only adjusting the states that are directly involved in the loop head, the relevant state to adjust is `int(input())`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers, `j` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0**
