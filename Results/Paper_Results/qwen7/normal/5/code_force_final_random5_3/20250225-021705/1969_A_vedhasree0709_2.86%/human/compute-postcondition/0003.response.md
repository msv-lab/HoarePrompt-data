Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `l`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `i` updated to 0.
