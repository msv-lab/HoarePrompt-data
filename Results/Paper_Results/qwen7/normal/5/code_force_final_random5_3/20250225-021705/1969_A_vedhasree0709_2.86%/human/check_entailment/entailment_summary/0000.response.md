Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The program only checks for a specific pattern (`i+2` followed by `i+1`) in the list `p`, which is too restrictive. The problem requires finding pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and ensuring that both get invitations.

2. **Handling All Test Cases**: The program uses a while loop to iterate through the list `p` and checks for the specific pattern mentioned above. However, this approach fails to consider all possible configurations of the best friends' pairs and does not guarantee finding the minimum number of invitations needed.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the optimal solution involves more complex patterns of best friends. For instance, it fails to correctly identify situations where the minimum number of invitations required is 2, even if the specific pattern `i+2` followed by `i+1` is not present.

4. **Output Logic**: The program prints `2` if the specific pattern is found and `3` otherwise, without considering the actual minimum number of invitations needed to satisfy the condition of having at least 2 friends at the party.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
