Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0, and `int(input())` is the previous value minus 1.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `l`. The variables `i`, `t`, `n`, `j`, and `int(input())` remain unchanged from their previous states.
