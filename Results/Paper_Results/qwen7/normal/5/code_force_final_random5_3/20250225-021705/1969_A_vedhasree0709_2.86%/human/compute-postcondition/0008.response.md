Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `j` is 0.
- The current value of `l[i]` is 2.
- The current value of `l[i + 1]` is 1.

The `print(2)` statement will simply print the integer 2.

Output: **2**
