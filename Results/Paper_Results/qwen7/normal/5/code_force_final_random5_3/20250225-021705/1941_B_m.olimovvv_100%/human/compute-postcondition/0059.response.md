Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`.

**Natural Language Description:** After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `b` will consist entirely of zeros. This means that for every index `i` in the list `b`, the value of `b[i]` will be 0. The variable `a` remains greater than 2, and `t` retains its initial value within the specified range.
