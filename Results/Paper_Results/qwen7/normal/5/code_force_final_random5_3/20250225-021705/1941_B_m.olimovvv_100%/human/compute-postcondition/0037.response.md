Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is assigned the value of the corresponding input integer from the split input, and the current value of `b[i]` is less than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
