Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is assigned the value of the corresponding input integer from the split input, and `i` is `a - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns them to the list `b`. The length of `b` will be equal to the number of integers input. The variable `t` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, and `i` is set to `a - 2`.
