Output: **NO**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is greater than 2.
- `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is assigned the value of the corresponding input integer from the split input.
- The current value of `b[i]` is less than 0.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. Since no other variables or objects are being referenced in this print statement, the output is directly the string `'NO'`.
