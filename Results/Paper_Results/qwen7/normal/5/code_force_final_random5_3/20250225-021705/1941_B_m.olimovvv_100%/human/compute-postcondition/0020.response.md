Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`, and `i` is \(a - 3\)**.

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts `b[i]` from itself, resulting in `b[i]` being set to 0. Since `b[i]` was already 0, this operation does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state.
