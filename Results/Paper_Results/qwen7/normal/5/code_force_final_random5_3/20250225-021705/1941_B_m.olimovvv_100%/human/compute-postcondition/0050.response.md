Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i+1]` is equal to `b[i+1] - 2 * b[i]` for all `i`, `i` is `a - 2`, `b[i]` is decreased by `b[i]` (so `b[i]` is now 0)**.

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts `b[i]` from itself, effectively setting `b[i]` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
