Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`, `i` is \(a - 2\), and `b[i + 2]` is \(-2 \times b[i + 1]\).**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b[i + 2]` by subtracting `b[i]`. Given that `b[i]` is 0, the value of `b[i + 2]` becomes \(-2 \times 0 = 0\). Therefore, `b[i + 2]` is now 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
