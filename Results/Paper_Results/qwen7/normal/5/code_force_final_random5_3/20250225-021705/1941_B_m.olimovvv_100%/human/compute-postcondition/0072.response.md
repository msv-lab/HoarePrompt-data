Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be at least 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces, and the value of `b[i]` is decreased by the value of `b[i]`, making `b[i]` equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts the value of `b[i]` from itself, effectively setting `b[i]` to 0. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
