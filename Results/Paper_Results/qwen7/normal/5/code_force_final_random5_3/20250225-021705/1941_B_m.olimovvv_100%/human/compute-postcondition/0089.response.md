Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be at least 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces, `i` is 2, `b[i]` is reduced by `2 * b[i]` which means `b[2]` is now `-b[2]`**

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts `b[i]` from itself, effectively setting `b[i]` to 0. However, the problem statement specifies that `b[i + 2]` is reduced by `2 * b[i]`. Since `i` is 2, `b[i + 2]` refers to `b[4]`. But the subtraction operation on `b[i]` itself does not depend on the value of `b[4]`, it just sets `b[2]` to 0. Therefore, `b[2]` is now 0, and the rest of the conditions remain unchanged.
