Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer such that \(a \geq 3\), `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces, and both `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the conditions inside the loop ensure that each element `b[i]` is modified according to the specified rules. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `a - 3`. For each iteration, if `b[i]` is negative, the loop breaks and prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it modifies `b[i+1]`, `b[i+2]`, and `b[i]` as described. If the loop completes without breaking and the last two elements of `b` are non-zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. Given that the loop has executed fully, it implies that no negative values were encountered, and the final state of `b` ensures that `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are both 0, leading to the output 'YES'.
