Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is greater than 2.
- `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i+2]` is equal to `b[i+2] - b[i]` for all `i`.
- `i` is `a - 2`.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

The value of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are not needed to determine the output of the print statement since the statement itself does not depend on these variables. The print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
