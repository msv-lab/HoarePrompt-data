Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `b[i]` is not less than 0, no specific change is made to the variables.
