You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each test case consists of three integers n, f, and k such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, followed by a list of n integers a_i where 1 <= a_i <= 100.

        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions hold:
    #
    #- `greater_count` will be the total number of elements in the list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value` across all iterations.
    #- `same_value_count` will be the total number of times the element at index `f-1` (i.e., `favorite_value`) appears in the list `a` across all iterations.
    #- `favorite_value` will be the element at index `f-1` in the list `a` for each iteration.
    #- `n`, `f`, and `k` will retain their original input values.
    #- `t` will remain unchanged, as it represents the number of iterations.
    #- `_` will be the last index value from the loop, which is `t-1`.
    #- The list `a` will be empty since all its elements have been processed in each iteration.
    #- If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, the final output will be `'YES'`.
    #- If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, the final output will be `'NO'`.
    #- Otherwise, the final output will be `'MAYBE'`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( a_i \). For each test case, it determines whether the count of elements greater than the \( f \)-th element in the list plus the count of occurrences of the \( f \)-th element itself is sufficient to meet or exceed \( k \). If the count of greater elements is at least \( k \), it prints 'YES'. If the sum of greater elements and identical elements is less than or equal to \( k \), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the values of the cubes into the list `a`.

2. **Finding Favorite Cube Value:**
   - The program extracts the value of the favorite cube using `a[f - 1]`. This is correct because the favorite cube is at index `f - 1` (0-based indexing).

3. **Counting Same Value Cubes:**
   - The program counts how many cubes have the same value as the favorite cube (`same_value_count`). This is necessary to understand how many cubes are tied with the favorite cube in terms of value.

4. **Counting Greater Value Cubes:**
   - The program counts how many cubes have a value greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`). This helps determine if there are enough cubes with strictly greater values to remove the favorite cube.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints 'YES'. This means there are enough cubes with strictly greater values to ensure the favorite cube is removed.
   - If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints 'NO'. This means there are not enough cubes (either with strictly greater values or with the same value) to remove the favorite cube.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE', indicating that the removal of the favorite cube depends on the exact positions of the cubes after sorting.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - `n = 5`, `f = 2`, `k = 2`, `a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`
   - Favorite value: `3`
   - `greater_count = 1` (only one cube with value 4)
   - `same_value_count = 3` (three cubes with value 3)
   - Since `greater_count < k`, but `greater_count + same_value_count > k`, it should print 'MAYBE'.

2. **Example 2:**
   - `n = 5`, `f = 5`, `k = 3`, `a = [5, 2, 1, 3, 4]`
   - Favorite value: `4`
   - `greater_count = 1` (only one cube with value 5)
   - `same_value_count = 0` (no other cube with the same value)
   - Since `greater_count + same_value_count < k`, it should print 'NO'.

3. **Example 3:**
   - `n = 5`, `f = 5`, `k = 2`, `a = [5, 2, 1, 3, 4]`
   - Favorite value: `4`
   - `greater_count = 1` (only one cube with value 5)
   - `same_value_count = 0` (no other cube with the same value)
   - Since `greater_count < k`, but `greater_count + same_value_count < k`, it should print 'NO'.

4. **Example 4:**
   - `n = 5`, `f = 5`, `k = 5`, `a = [5, 2, 1, 3, 4]`
   - Favorite value: `4`
   - `greater_count = 1` (only one cube with value 5)
   - `same_value_count = 0` (no other cube with the same value)
   - Since `greater_count + same_value_count < k`, it should print 'NO'.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
