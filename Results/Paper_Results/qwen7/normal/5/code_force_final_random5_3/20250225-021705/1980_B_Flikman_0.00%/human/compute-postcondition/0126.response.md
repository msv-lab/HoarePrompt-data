Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for value in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `value` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: 
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - For each `value` in `a`, it checks if `value` is greater than `favorite_value`.
   - If `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, `greater_count` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list with at least one element.
   - `greater_count` is the count of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is about to start another iteration, the current `value` has been processed.
   - The next `value` in the list `a` will be considered in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `a` will now be the list without the first element that was just processed.
   - `greater_count` remains unchanged unless the new `value` is greater than `favorite_value`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` must now be the list without the first element.
   - `greater_count` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `a` is a list with at least one element (excluding the first element), `greater_count` remains unchanged.**

To express this clearly:

**State: `a` is a list with at least one element (excluding the first element processed in the previous iteration), `greater_count` remains unchanged.**
