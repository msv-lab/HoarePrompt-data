Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers (excluding the first element), `value` is the third element of the original list `a`, `same_value_count` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `same_value_count += 1` increments the value of `same_value_count` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `value` is still the third element of the original list `a`, and `a` remains a non-empty list of integers excluding the first element.
