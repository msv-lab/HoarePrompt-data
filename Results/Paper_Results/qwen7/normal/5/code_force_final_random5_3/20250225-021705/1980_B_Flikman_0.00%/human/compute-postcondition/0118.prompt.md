Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `same_value_count` is updated to 0, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f-1` in the list `a`, `n` retains its original value, `f` retains its original value, `k` retains its original value, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `_` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value == favorite_value:
        same_value_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of integers, and `value` is the first element of the list `a`. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of integers (excluding the first element). The value of `value` is the second element of the original list `a`. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is increased by 1. If `value` is not equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of integers (excluding the first element). The variable `same_value_count` is increased by 1 if the third element `value` of the list `a` equals `favorite_value`. If `value` does not equal `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
