Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the cost of cyclic shifts properly. Specifically, it assumes that every occurrence of '0' followed by '1's should be treated as a separate operation, which is not always the case.

For example, consider the input string "101011". The optimal strategy would involve the following steps:
1. Choose the substring [1, 3]: "101011" -> "010111". Cost: 3.
2. Choose the substring [2, 5]: "010111" -> "001111". Cost: 4.
3. Choose the substring [3, 6]: "001111" -> "000111". Cost: 4.
The total cost is 3 + 4 + 4 = 11.

However, the current implementation would incorrectly calculate the cost as follows:
- It counts the first '0' and all '1's after it as one operation, resulting in a cost of 4.
- It then counts the second '0' and all '1's after it as another operation, resulting in a cost of 4.
- It does not account for the optimal way to perform the shifts.

Thus, the program does not handle the problem correctly for this and potentially other cases.
