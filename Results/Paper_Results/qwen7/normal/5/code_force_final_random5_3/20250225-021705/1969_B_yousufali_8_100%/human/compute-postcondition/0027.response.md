Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `n` will be the count of '1's in the string `s`, and `ans` will be the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence of '0' followed by a '1'.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has run through all characters of the string `s`, the variable `i` will have the value of the length of `s`. The variable `n` will hold the total count of '1's found in `s`. The variable `ans` will contain the sum of `n + 1` for every instance where '0' is immediately followed by '1' in the string `s`.
