Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is a string with length at least 1, `n` is incremented by 2 if `s[2]` is equal to '1', `ans` is `n + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += n + 1` increments the value of `ans` by `n + 1`. The value of `n` was incremented by 2 if `s[2]` was equal to '1', otherwise, it remained unchanged. The values of `i` and `s` remain as they were before the code execution. Therefore, `ans` is now `n + 1`, where `n` is either its original value or incremented by 2 depending on the condition.
