Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the string `s`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `s`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is a string with a length of at least 1.
   - `n` is incremented by 1 (though its exact value is not specified).

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The condition for the next iteration is `i < len(s)`. Given that `i` is currently 1, the next iteration will proceed if `len(s)` is greater than 1.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `s` remains the same string with a length of at least 1.
   - `n` is incremented by 1, but since its exact value isn't specified, we only know it has been incremented once.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `s` is a string with length at least 1, `n` is incremented by 1**.
