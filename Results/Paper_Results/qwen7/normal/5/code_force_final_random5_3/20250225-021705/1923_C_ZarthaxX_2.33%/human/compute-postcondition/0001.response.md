Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated input, `q` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated input, `t` is a positive integer, `c` is an array of integers obtained from the remaining space-separated inputs, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it into space-separated values, converts each value to an integer, and stores them in the list `nums`. The values of `n`, `q`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state. The array `c` is not modified, and its length `n` and the number of queries `q` are not defined yet.
