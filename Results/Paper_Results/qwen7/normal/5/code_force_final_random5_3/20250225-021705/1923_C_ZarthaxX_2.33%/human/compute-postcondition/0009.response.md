Output State: **`ones[i]` is 1, `ones[i - 1]` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `t` is a positive integer, `c` is an array of integers, `nums` is a list of integers, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except for the first element which is 1, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `sum[3]` is `sum[2] + nums[2] - 1`, `ones[3]` is `ones[2] + (1 if nums[2] == 1 else 0)`**

Explanation: The code updates `ones[i]` based on the value of `ones[i - 1]` and `nums[i - 1]`. Given `i` is 3, `ones[i - 1]` is `ones[2]`, which is 0. The condition checks if `nums[2]` is 1, and since no specific value for `nums[2]` is given, we keep it as a conditional expression. Therefore, `ones[3]` is calculated as `0 + (1 if nums[2] == 1 else 0)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
