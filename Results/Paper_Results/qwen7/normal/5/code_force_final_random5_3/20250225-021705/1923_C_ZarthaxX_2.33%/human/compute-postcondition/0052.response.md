Output State: **`ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `q` is `q - 3`, `l` and `r` are updated to their final values obtained from the last input, and `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.**

In Natural Language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ones` will still have its first element as 1 and all other elements as 0. This is because the loop updates only `ones[i]` to `ones[i - 1] + 1` if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, but it does not change any other elements in `ones`. The variable `sum` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` minus 1 up to each index, reflecting the cumulative effect of the loop's operations on `sum`. The variable `q` will be reduced by the total number of iterations, which is 3 in this case. The variables `l` and `r` will hold the values provided by the last input since these variables are updated with each iteration of the loop. The variables `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` will reflect the values computed for the last range `[l, r]` processed by the loop.
