### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the problem and the solution provided. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions.
   - A subarray is good if there exists another array `b` such that:
     - The sums of the elements of `a` and `b` are equal.
     - No element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and preprocesses the array `c` using cumulative arrays `ones` and `sum`.
   - `ones[i]` stores the count of `1`s up to index `i-1`.
   - `sum[i]` stores the sum of elements from the start up to index `i-1` minus the count of `1`s.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray is good using the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \le \text{sumInRange}\).

3. **Condition for Good Subarray**:
   - Simplifying the condition, we get \(\text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \le \text{sumInRange}\).
   - This condition ensures that the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` where the sum of `b` equals the sum of the subarray and no element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the subarray length is 1 by printing `NO`.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of cumulative arrays `ones` and `sum` allows for efficient computation of the required values for each query.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions.

Given the detailed analysis and the correct implementation of the logic, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions.
