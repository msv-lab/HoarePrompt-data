Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` and `r` are updated to the integers input by the user, we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables within the `continue` statement itself, the values of `onesInRange`, `ones`, `sum`, `sumInRange`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their previous states. The loop continues to its next iteration.
