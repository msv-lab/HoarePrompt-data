Postcondition: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` and `r` are updated to the integers input by the user, and the loop continues if `l` equals `r`. If the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the same condition is checked again in the next iteration of the loop.**
