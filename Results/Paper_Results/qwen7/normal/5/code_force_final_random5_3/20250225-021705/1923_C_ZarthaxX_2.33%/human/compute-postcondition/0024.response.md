Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and if `l` is equal to `r`, the current values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code calculates `sumInRange` as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. This updates the value of `sumInRange` without affecting the other variables. The conditions and values of the other variables remain the same as the initial state.
