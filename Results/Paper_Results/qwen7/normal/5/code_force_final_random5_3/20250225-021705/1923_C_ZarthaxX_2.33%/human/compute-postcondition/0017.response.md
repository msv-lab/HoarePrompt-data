Output State: **`ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `q` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `l` and `r` from the input using `map(int, input().split(' '))`. This means `l` and `r` are assigned the values of the integers entered by the user, separated by a space. No other variables are affected, so the lists `ones` and `sum` retain their initial states, and the variables `q` and `_` remain unchanged.
