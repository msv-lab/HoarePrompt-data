Based on the initial state provided:

- `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0.
- `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index.
- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- `q` is `q - 1`.
- `l` and `r` are updated to the integers input by the user.
- The loop continues if `l` equals `r`.

However, the `print('YES')` statement is outside of any conditional logic that would depend on the values of `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, or `sumInRange`. Therefore, regardless of the values of these variables, the `print('YES')` statement will always execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
