Output State: `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus the index, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `t` is a positive integer, `c` is an array of integers, `nums` is a list of integers.

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n`. The `ones` list will still have the first element as 1 and the rest as 0 because the loop only modifies `ones[i]` by adding 1 if `nums[i-1]` is 1, but it doesn't reset the first element. The `sum` list will contain the cumulative sum of the `nums` list minus the index, meaning `sum[i]` will be the sum of all elements in `nums` up to index `i-1` minus the number of elements considered so far. All other variables (`n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
