Postcondition: `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `q` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the current value of `l` is equal to `r`.
