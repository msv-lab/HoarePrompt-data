Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ones[i]` is 1
   - `ones[i - 1]` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `q` is an integer
   - `t` is a positive integer
   - `c` is an array of integers
   - `nums` is a list of integers
   - `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except for the first element which is 1
   - `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0
   - `sum[2]` is `sum[1] + nums[1] - 1`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ones[i]` is 1, `ones[i - 1]` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `t` is a positive integer, `c` is an array of integers, `nums` is a list of integers, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except for the first element which is 1, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `sum[3]` is `sum[2] + nums[2] - 1`**.
