Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `prod` is the product of 1, the first element of `vals`, and the second element of `vals` multiplied by the third element of `vals`, `r` is the third element of `vals`.**

Explanation: The code `prod *= r` multiplies the current value of `prod` by `r`, which is the third element of the list `vals`. Since `prod` was initially set to the product of 1, the first element of `vals`, and the second element of `vals`, after executing the code, `prod` will be updated to the product of these values and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged.
