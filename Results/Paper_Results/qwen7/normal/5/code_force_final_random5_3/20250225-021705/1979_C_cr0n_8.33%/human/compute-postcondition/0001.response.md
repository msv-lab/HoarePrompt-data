Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `vals`. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged from their initial state.
