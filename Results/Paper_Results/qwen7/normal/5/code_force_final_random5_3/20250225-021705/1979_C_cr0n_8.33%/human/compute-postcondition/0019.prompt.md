You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and k_i is an integer such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, `r` is the last element of `vals`.
    #
    #In this final output state, `t` and `N` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The `vals` list contains all the original integers that were processed. The variable `prod` has been updated to hold the cumulative product of all elements in `vals`. The variable `r` holds the value of the last element in `vals` since it is reassigned in each iteration of the loop.
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, `r` is the last element of `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of `prod` divided by each element `r` in `vals` (excluding the last element), `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: 
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
