Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input().strip())` reads an integer input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace (though stripping usually doesn't affect integer inputs), and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and its properties (being a positive integer between 1 and 10^4) are still valid. The variable `N` now holds the value of the input integer, which is constrained to be between 1 and 50.
