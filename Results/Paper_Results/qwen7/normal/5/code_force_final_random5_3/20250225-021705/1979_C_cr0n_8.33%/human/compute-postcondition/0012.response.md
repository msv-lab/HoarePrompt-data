Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, `r` is the last element of `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of `prod` divided by each element `r` in `vals` (excluding the last element), `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`**.

This means that the variable `den` has been calculated as the difference between `prod` and the sum of all elements in the list `vprod`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial conditions.
