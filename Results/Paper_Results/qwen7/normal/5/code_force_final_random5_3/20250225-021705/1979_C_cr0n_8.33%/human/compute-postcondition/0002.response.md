Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `prod` is 1.**

The code initializes the variable `prod` to 1. No other operations are performed on `t`, `N`, or `vals`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged. The value of `prod` is specifically set to 1.
