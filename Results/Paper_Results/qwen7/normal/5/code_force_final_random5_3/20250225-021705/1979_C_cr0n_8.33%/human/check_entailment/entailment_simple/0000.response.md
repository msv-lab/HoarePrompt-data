Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins across different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. This means for each outcome \(i\), the sum of all bets should be less than \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\).

2. **Analyzed Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - It computes a list `vprod` where each element is the product of `prod` divided by each element `r` in `vals` (excluding the last element). This step is incorrect because it doesn't account for the actual bet distribution needed.
   - It calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`. This calculation is also incorrect because `vprod` is not correctly representing the required bet distribution.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - If `den` is greater than zero, it prints the values in `vprod`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would involve finding a set of bets \(x_i\) such that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.
   - One simple strategy is to bet a fixed amount \(x\) on each outcome, and ensure that \(x \times N < k_i \times x\) for all \(i\). This simplifies to \(x < k_i\). Since \(k_i \geq 2\), the smallest \(x\) that satisfies this condition is \(x = 1\).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly solve the problem. It incorrectly calculates `vprod` and `den`, and does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   - A correct solution would simply print `1` for each outcome if a solution exists, or `-1` otherwise.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
