Output State: `start_year` is the result of applying the operation `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each index `x` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1` in sequence, and `x` is `len(nums)`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be the final value obtained by successively applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the list `nums`, starting from `x = 0` up to `x = len(nums) - 1`. The variable `x` will be equal to `len(nums)`, indicating that all elements in `nums` have been processed.
