Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `start_year` will be the result of applying the operation \((\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[x] + 1) * \text{nums}[x]\) for each index \(x\) from 0 to \(len(nums) - 1\).

To understand this, consider that in each iteration of the loop, the value of `start_year` is updated based on the current value of `nums[x]`. Specifically, `start_year` is recalculated as \((\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[x] + 1) * \text{nums}[x]\). This process is repeated for every element in the list `nums`.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `nums` exactly once, the final value of `start_year` will be the result of applying this operation sequentially to each element in the list. In simpler terms, `start_year` will be transformed according to the rule given by the loop body for each element in `nums`.

For example, if `nums` is `[2, 3, 4]` and `start_year` initially is 12, then after the first iteration (`x=0`), `start_year` becomes \((12 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 14\). After the second iteration (`x=1`), it becomes \((14 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 15\). And finally, after the third iteration (`x=2`), it becomes \((15 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 16\).

Thus, the final `start_year` after all iterations will be the result of applying the given operation to each element in `nums` in sequence.
