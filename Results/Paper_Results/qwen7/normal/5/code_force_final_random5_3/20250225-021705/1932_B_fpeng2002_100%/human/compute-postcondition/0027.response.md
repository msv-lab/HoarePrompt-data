Output State: `x` is `len(nums) - 1`; `start_year` is ((((start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2] // nums[3] + 1) * nums[3] if there are 4 numbers in the list, or similarly reduced for fewer numbers.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` will be equal to the length of the list `nums` minus one, indicating that the loop has processed each element in the list. The variable `start_year` will hold the final value calculated by successively applying the operation `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the list, starting from the first element and moving towards the last one.
