Output State: **`x` is `len(nums) - 1`; `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. The values of `x` and `num_tests` remain unchanged from their initial states.
