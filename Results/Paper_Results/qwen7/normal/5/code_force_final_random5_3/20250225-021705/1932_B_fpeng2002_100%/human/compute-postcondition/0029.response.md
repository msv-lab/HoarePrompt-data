The loop head contains the variable `num_tests`, which determines whether the loop can execute one more time. According to the given loop condition `while num_tests > 0`, the loop can execute again as long as `num_tests` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `x` is `len(nums) - 1`
- `start_year` is the result of the calculation involving `nums` as described.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0. Since we don't know the exact value of `num_tests` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `num_tests` is set to a value greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `num_tests` is greater than 0.

State: **`x` is `len(nums) - 1`; `start_year` is the result of the calculation involving `nums`, and `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
