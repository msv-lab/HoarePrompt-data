Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `start_year` is \((\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[1] + 1) * \text{nums}[1]\)
- `x` is 1

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `x` is used in the loop head.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`.

### Current State
- `x` is currently 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented to 2.

### Updated State
- Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be 2.
- The value of `start_year` remains unchanged from the previous iteration because it is not modified within the loop.

### Final State
- `start_year` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `x` is now 2.

### Answer
State: **`start_year` is \((\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[1] + 1) * \text{nums}[1]\), `x` is 2**
