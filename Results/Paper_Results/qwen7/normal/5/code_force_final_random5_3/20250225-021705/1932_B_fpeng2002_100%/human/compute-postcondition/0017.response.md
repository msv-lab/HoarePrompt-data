Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 2`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `num_tests` is decremented by 1 because the code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to `n`. The initial state was `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, so after decrementing `num_tests` again, it becomes `num_tests - 2`. The value of `n` is set to the integer input provided by the user.
