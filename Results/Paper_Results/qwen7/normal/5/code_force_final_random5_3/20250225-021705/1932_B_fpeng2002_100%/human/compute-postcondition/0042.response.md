Output State: `start_year` is the result of applying the operation `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each `x` in the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`, and `x` is `len(nums)`.

To explain this in more detail:
- The loop iterates over each index `x` in the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.
- For each iteration, the value of `start_year` is updated using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
- After all iterations, `x` will be equal to `len(nums)`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The final value of `start_year` is the result of sequentially applying the given operation for each element in `nums`.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `start_year` has been updated through the specified operations for all elements in `nums`, and `x` is equal to the length of `nums`.
