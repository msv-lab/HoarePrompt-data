Output State: The value of `start_year` after the loop executes all iterations is determined by applying the operation `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each index `x` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `start_year` will be the result of sequentially applying the given operation for each element in the `nums` list, starting from the initial `start_year` value of 0. This means that `start_year` will be updated `len(nums)` times, with each update based on the current value of `start_year` and the corresponding element in the `nums` list.
