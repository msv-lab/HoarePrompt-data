Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list; `start_year` is ((((start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2] if the length of `nums` is 3 or more, otherwise it will be one of the previous intermediate values depending on the length of `nums`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` will be equal to the total number of elements in the `nums` list. The variable `start_year` will be updated according to the formula applied in each iteration of the loop, starting from an initial value of 0 and dividing, adding, and multiplying with each element in the `nums` list in sequence.
