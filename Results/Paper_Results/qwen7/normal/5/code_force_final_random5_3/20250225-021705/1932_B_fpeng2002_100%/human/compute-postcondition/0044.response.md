Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `start_year` will be the result of applying the operation \((\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[x] + 1) * \text{nums}[x]\) for each index \(x\) from 0 to \(len(nums) - 1\), and `x` will be equal to \(len(nums)\).**

In simpler terms, after the loop has run through all its iterations, the variable `start_year` will hold the final value obtained by successively applying the operation \((\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[x] + 1) * \text{nums}[x]\) to each element in the list `nums`, starting from the first element and moving towards the last one. The variable `x` will be set to the length of the list `nums`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the list.
