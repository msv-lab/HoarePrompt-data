#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The `arr` list will be empty, and `freq` will be a dictionary containing the count of each unique stick length from the original list. Specifically, for every unique length `n` in the original `arr`, `freq[n]` will be the total number of times `n` appeared in `arr`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `freq` will have an entry for each distinct stick length found in the initial `arr`, with the value being the frequency of that stick length. The `arr` list will be empty because all elements have been processed and moved into the `freq` dictionary.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks. It counts the frequency of each unique stick length, stores these counts in a dictionary, and then returns the sum of each count divided by 3. The input list is left empty after processing.
