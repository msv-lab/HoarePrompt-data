Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks. It returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3.**

Note: The `freq` dictionary is not directly provided as a parameter but is implied to be derived from the `arr` list, which is not detailed in the given information. However, based on the output description, it seems the function calculates the integer division of the frequency of each stick length by 3 and returns the sum of these divisions.
