Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly reads the input and calls the function `func_1` with the list of stick lengths.
- The function `func_1` processes the list of stick lengths by counting the frequency of each unique stick length using a dictionary.
- After counting the frequencies, the function calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by summing up the integer division of each frequency by 3 (`v // 3`), since each polygon requires 3 sides.
- This approach is correct because it ensures that no stick is used more than once and maximizes the number of polygons formed.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed.

Correctness: **True**
