Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `n` is the next element in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with one entry where the key is `n` and the value is 3**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency of `n` in the `freq` dictionary. Initially, `freq[n]` is set to 2. The line `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1` retrieves the current count of `n` from the dictionary (which is 2), adds 1 to it, and updates the dictionary. Therefore, the new value for `freq[n]` is 3.
