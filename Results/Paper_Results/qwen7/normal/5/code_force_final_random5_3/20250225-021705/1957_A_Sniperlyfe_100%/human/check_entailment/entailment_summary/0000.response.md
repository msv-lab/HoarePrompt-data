Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the maximum number of regular polygons (triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.) that can be constructed using the given sticks without breaking any sticks.
- A regular polygon with \( k \) sides requires \( k \) sticks of the same length.
- The provided code correctly counts the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary.
- The function `func_1` then calculates how many complete polygons can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3 (since the smallest polygon is a triangle, which requires 3 sticks of the same length).
- However, the execution summary mentions that the input list is left empty after processing, which suggests that the function does not handle the input as expected. This is a potential issue, but upon reviewing the code, it appears that the function does process the input correctly within its scope.

Given that the function logic is sound and the provided code processes the input as intended, the function should work correctly for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
