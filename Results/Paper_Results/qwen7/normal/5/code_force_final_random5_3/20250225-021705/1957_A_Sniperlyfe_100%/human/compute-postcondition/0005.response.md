Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `n` is the next element in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with one entry where the key is `n` and the value is 2**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency of `n` in the `freq` dictionary. Initially, `freq` has one entry where the key is `n` and the value is 1. After executing `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1`, the value of `freq[n]` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
