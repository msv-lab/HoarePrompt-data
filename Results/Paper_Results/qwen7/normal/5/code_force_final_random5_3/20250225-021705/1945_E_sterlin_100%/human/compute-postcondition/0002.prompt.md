You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, where n is the length of the permutation and x is the number to be found. The second line of each test case contains a list of integers p representing the permutation of length n.
def func_5():
    return input().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings containing the values of t, n, and x for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t, followed by pairs of integers n and x, and a list of integers p. For each test case, it returns a list of strings containing the values of t, n, and x.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of strings containing the values of t, n, and x for each test case.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
