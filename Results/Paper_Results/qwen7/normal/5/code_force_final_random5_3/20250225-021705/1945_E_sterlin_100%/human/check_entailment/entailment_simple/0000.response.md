### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation using at most two swaps so that the binary search on the modified permutation will find the target value `x` at position `l`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads input and processes each test case.
   - It uses a dictionary to map each element in the permutation to its index.
   - It performs a binary search to find the position where `x` should be placed.
   - Depending on whether `x` is already in the correct position or not, it either performs 0, 1, or 2 swaps to ensure `x` is at the correct position for the binary search.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The binary search is implemented correctly and follows the standard procedure.
   - The logic for determining the necessary swaps is sound. Specifically:
     - If `x` is already in the correct position (`p[left] == x`), no swaps are needed.
     - If `x` is not in the current range but is not yet seen, one swap is needed.
     - If `x` is not in the current range and has been seen, two swaps are needed to place `x` correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge cases where `x` might be out of the initial range but is seen later, ensuring the correct placement through the required number of swaps.

5. **Function Definitions**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are defined to read input and process it correctly according to the problem statement.
   - The remaining functions (`func_4` and `func_5`) are not used in the main logic and appear to be placeholders or misnamed.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for finding the correct swaps and performing them is correct.
   - The binary search and the subsequent swap logic align with the problem requirements.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
