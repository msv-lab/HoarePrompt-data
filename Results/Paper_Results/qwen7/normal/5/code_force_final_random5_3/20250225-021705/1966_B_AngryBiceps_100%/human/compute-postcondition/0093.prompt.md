Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and n * m ≤ 3 * 10^5; each test case consists of n lines, each containing m characters 'W' (for white) and 'B' (for black), representing the initial colors of the grid.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
        ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input from the user, `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each element in the list `a`, and `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each element in the list `a`. If the set of the first element in `a` contains only one unique character, the set of the last element in `a` contains only one unique character, and the first and last elements in `a` are not the same, then `first_row` and `last_row` both contain more than one unique character or `first_row` and `last_row` are equal. Otherwise, `first_row` contains at least two different characters, or `last_row` contains at least two different characters, or both the first and last elements of `a` contain only one character but are the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n+1`, `n` is greater than 0, `last_row` is the input integer plus (n-1) times the last element of the last sublist in `a`, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input from `input()`, `first_row` is the input integer plus the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `a`, `m` is an input integer, and the following conditions hold:
- Either the first row of `a` is a list with all elements the same, the last row of `a` is a list with all elements the same, and the first row is different from the last row.
- Or the first row of `a` contains at least two different elements, or the last row of `a` contains at least two different elements, or the first row is equal to the last row.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list of length `n` containing all the inputs in the order they were provided, `first_row` is a string formed by taking the first character of each string in `a`, and `last_row` is a string formed by taking the last character of each string in `a`. Either the first element of `a` is a string with all characters the same and the last element of `a` is a string with all characters the same and the first element is not equal to the last element, or the first element of `a` contains only one distinct character and the last element of `a` contains only one distinct character and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, or the first element of `a` does not contain at least two distinct characters, or the last element of `a` does not contain at least two distinct characters, or the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
