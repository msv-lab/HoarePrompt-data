Output State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input provided by the user, `first_row` is the sum of the first element of the first element in list `a` and the first element of the last element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` increments the value of `first_row` by the first element of the last sublist in `a`. Given that `a` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input provided by the user, `first_row` is updated to be the sum of the first element of the first sublist (which is `first_row` itself) and the first element of the last sublist (`a[-1][0]`). The other variables remain unchanged.
