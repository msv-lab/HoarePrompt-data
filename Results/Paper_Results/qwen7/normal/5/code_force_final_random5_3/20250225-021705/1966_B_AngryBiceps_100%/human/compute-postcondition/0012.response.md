Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing the first element as the input from the user, `first_row` is the first element of the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last sublist in the list `a` plus the last element of the last sublist in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments the value of `last_row` by the last element of the last sublist in the list `a`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact structure of `a`, we assume `a` is at least a list with one sublist. The value of `last_row` is updated accordingly, while the other variables remain unchanged.
