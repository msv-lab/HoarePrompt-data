Output State: **`n` is an integer from `int(input()) - 1`, `m` is an integer from `input().split()`**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `n` and `m`. The first integer is derived from the initial state `int(input()) - 1`, which means `n` is one less than the integer input by the user. The second integer is obtained by splitting the user input into two parts and converting each part to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, assigning the first part to `n` and the second part to `m`. The original value of `int(input()) - 1` is updated to `n`, and `m` is the second integer from the split input.
