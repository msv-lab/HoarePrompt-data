Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `last_row` is the input integer.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `a` is a list containing one element which is an input integer.
   - `first_row` is the input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `n` in the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is now `n`, the loop will check if `n < n`, which is false, and thus the loop will terminate.

5. **Update the required states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `n`.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is a condition for the loop but not modified within the loop itself.
   - `last_row`, `a`, `first_row`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration (if it were to occur) would be:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_row` is the input integer, `a` is a list containing one element which is an input integer, `first_row` is the input integer, `m` is an input integer**. 

However, since the loop will not execute again due to the condition `i < n` being false when `i` equals `n`, the final state remains as:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_row` is the input integer, `a` is a list containing one element which is an input integer, `first_row` is the input integer, `m` is an input integer**.
