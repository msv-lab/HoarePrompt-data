You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list of length `n` containing all the inputs in the order they were provided, `first_row` is a string formed by taking the first character of each string in `a`, and `last_row` is a string formed by taking the last character of each string in `a`. The loop processes all the test cases provided as input, and based on the conditions checked within the loop, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. If any test case meets the conditions to print 'NO', the loop will print 'NO' for that specific test case. Otherwise, for all other test cases, it will print 'YES'. The final state of `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` will reflect the last processed test case's data, and the loop will terminate once all test cases have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid represented by `n` rows and `m` columns of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters. For each test case, it checks if the first and last rows, as well as the first and last characters of each row, are uniform but different from each other. If any test case fails this condition, it prints 'NO' for that case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Specifically, the program checks only the first and last rows and columns, which is insufficient to determine the possibility of making all squares the same color.

Consider the following test case:
```
3 3
BBB
BBB
BBB
```

In this case, all squares are already the same color (black), so the correct output should be "YES". However, the program will not detect this scenario because it only checks the first and last rows and columns. Since the first and last rows and columns are all 'B', the program incorrectly prints "NO".

Additionally, consider another test case:
```
3 3
BBW
BBW
BBW
```

Here, it is possible to make all squares the same color by performing the operations described in the problem statement. However, the program will incorrectly print "NO" because the first and last rows and columns are not all the same color.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
