Output State: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input provided by the user in each iteration, `first_row` is the concatenation of the first element of each string in the list `a`, `last_row` is the concatenation of the last element of each string in the list `a`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will be equal to the total number of inputs provided, `i` will be equal to `n` (since the loop runs `n` times), `a` will be a list of length `n` containing all the inputs in the order they were provided, `first_row` will be a string formed by taking the first character of each string in `a`, and `last_row` will be a string formed by taking the last character of each string in `a`.
