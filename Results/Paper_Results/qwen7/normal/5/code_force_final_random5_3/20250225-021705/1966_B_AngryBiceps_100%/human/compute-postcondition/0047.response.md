Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n+1`, and since `n` must be greater than 0, `i` will be at least 2.
- `last_row` is the input integer plus `(n-1)` times the last element of the last sublist in `a`.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being an input from `input()`.
- `first_row` is the input integer plus the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `a`.
- `m` is an input integer.
- The first row of `a` is a list with all elements the same.
- The last row of `a` is a list with all elements the same.
- The first row is different from the last row.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Output: **NO**
