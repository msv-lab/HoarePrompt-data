t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500 and n * m ≤ 3 * 10^5; each test case consists of n lines, each containing m characters 'W' (for white) and 'B' (for black), representing the initial colors of the squares in the grid.
