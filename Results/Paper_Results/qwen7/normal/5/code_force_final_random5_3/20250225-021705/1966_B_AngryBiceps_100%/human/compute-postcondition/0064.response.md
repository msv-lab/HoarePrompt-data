Output State: **`n` is an integer from `int(input()) - 1`, `m` is an integer from `input().split()`, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string.**

The code initializes `first_row` as an empty string, but does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
