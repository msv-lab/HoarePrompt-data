Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of exactly n-1 characters, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit from `password` if the first character was a digit, otherwise it remains the same; `letters` is a list containing all the characters from the `password` string that are not digits plus one additional character if the first character was a letter, and `letters` has the new character appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `letters.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the list `letters`. Since `char` is part of the `password` string, it could either be a digit or a letter. The precondition states that if the first character of `password` was a letter, then an additional character is appended to `letters`. Regardless of whether `char` is a digit or a letter, it is added to `letters`. The states of `password` and `digits` remain unchanged unless `char` is the first character of `password` and it is a digit, which would affect `digits` only if it did not already contain a digit.
