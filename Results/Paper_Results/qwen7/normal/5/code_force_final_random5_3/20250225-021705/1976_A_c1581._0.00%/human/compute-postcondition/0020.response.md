Output State: **`last_digit_index` is -1**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `last_digit_index` to -1. This means that the last index of the last digit in the `password` string has been set to -1, indicating that no digits were found in the `password` string or that the search for the last digit index has not been performed yet. The values of `digits` and `letters` remain unchanged from their initial state.
