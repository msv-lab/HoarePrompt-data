Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes each one.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to check if a password meets the specified conditions:
   - It separates digits and letters into two lists.
   - It checks if there are no digits coming after a letter.
   - It sorts the digits and letters and checks if they are in the correct order.
3. The logic in the function is sound:
   - It correctly identifies if there are digits in the password and ensures they come before any letters.
   - It checks if the digits and letters are sorted.
4. The function handles all edge cases, such as passwords containing only letters or only digits, and correctly returns 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong according to the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
