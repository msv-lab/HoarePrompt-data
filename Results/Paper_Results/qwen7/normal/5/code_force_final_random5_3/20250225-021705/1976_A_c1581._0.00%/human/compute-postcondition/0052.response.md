Output State: **The program returns 'YES'**

Given the initial state, the `last_digit_index` is -1, meaning no digit was found in the `password` string. Also, the function did not return 'NO' during any iteration, which implies that every character in the `password` string is not a digit. Since the `digits` list is either empty or contains elements that are already sorted, and the `letters` list is sorted, these conditions do not affect the final return value. Therefore, the program returns 'YES'.
