Reasoning:
The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each password according to the specified conditions, and outputs whether each password is strong or not. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over these strings to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly separates the password into digits and letters.
   - It checks if there are any digits in the password. If there are, it ensures that no digit appears after a letter, which is handled by checking the position of the last digit in the password.
   - It then sorts the digits and letters separately and checks if they are in non-decreasing order.
   - If both the digits and letters meet the sorting criteria, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
