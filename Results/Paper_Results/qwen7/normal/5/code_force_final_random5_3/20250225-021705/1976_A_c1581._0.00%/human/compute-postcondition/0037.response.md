Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `char`.
2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `last_digit_index` is 1 if the second character in `password` is a digit, otherwise it remains -1.
   - `password` is a string.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `char` is the second character in `password`.
3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `password`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `char` should be the third character in `password`.

Given these points, we need to update the states accordingly:

- `i` will be incremented to 2.
- `char` will now be the third character in `password`.

Since the loop condition is based on the index `i`, and the character `char` is derived from the index `i`, we need to ensure that the conditions for the next iteration are met.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`last_digit_index` is 1 if the second character in `password` is a digit, otherwise it remains -1, `password` is a string, `i` is 2, and `char` is the third character in `password`**.
