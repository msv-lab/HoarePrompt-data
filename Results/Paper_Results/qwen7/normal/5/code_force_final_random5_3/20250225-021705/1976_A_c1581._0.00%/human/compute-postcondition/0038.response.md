Output State: **`last_digit_index` is 2, `password` is a string, `i` is 2, and `char` is the third character in `password`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `last_digit_index`. The other variables (`password`, `i`, and `char`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
