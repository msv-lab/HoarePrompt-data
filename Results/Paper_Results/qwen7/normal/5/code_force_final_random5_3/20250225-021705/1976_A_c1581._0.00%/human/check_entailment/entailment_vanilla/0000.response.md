Let's break down the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary information (`n` and `password`) for each case.

2. **Processing Each Password:**
   - For each password, it separates the characters into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It checks if any digit appears after a letter.
   - It sorts both `digits` and `letters` and checks if they match their expected sorted forms.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns 'NO'; otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - This part is correct. The program correctly reads all input and processes it for multiple test cases.

2. **Separating Digits and Letters:**
   - The logic to separate digits and letters into two lists is correct.

3. **Checking Digit Order:**
   - The check for whether a digit appears after a letter is correct. It uses `last_digit_index` to keep track of the most recent digit position and ensures that any subsequent character is a letter, which would violate the condition.

4. **Sorting and Validation:**
   - The program correctly checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where the password consists only of digits or only of letters correctly.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions. There are no logical errors or missing checks that could lead to incorrect results.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
