Output State: **`last_digit_index` is 1, `password` is a string, `i` is 1, and `char` is the second character in `password`.**

Explanation: The code sets `last_digit_index` to the value of `i`, which is initially 1. The other variables (`password`, `i`, and `char`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
