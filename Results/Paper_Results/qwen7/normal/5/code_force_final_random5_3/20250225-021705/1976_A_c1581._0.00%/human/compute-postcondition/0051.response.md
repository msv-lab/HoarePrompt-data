Postcondition: **The `last_digit_index` variable still holds the value -1, indicating that no digit was found in the `password` string. The function did not return 'NO' during any iteration, implying that every character in the `password` string is not a digit. Additionally, the `digits` list is either empty or contains elements that are already sorted. The `letters` list is sorted.**
