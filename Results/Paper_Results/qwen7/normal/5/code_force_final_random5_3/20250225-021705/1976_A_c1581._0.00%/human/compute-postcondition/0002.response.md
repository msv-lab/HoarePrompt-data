Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for char in password:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `char`, `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 <= n <= 20`, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
   - `digits` is an empty list.
   - `letters` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each character in the `password` string. For the loop to start executing, `password` must contain at least one character.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop depends on `password` having at least one character, we need to ensure that `password` is non-empty.
   - The values of `digits` and `letters` do not affect the loop's ability to start, as they are initialized to empty lists and will be populated during the loop iterations.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `password` must be a non-empty string.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of exactly n characters, where 1 <= n <= 20, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is an empty list.**
