Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of exactly \( n-2 \) characters, `char` is the current character from `password`, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit from `password` if the first character was a digit, otherwise it remains the same; `letters` is a list containing all the characters from the `password` string that are not digits plus one additional character which is `char`.**

The code appends the current character `char` to the `letters` list. The `password`, `digits`, and `char` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `letters` list now includes all characters from the `password` that are not digits, plus the current character `char`.
