Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` remains False, `i` is -1.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be decremented until it becomes -1 because the loop runs from `m-1` down to 0. Since the loop breaks when `ans` is set to `False`, `ans` will remain `False` throughout the loop's execution. The variable `m` will be reduced to 0 as the loop continues to decrement `i` from `m-1` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
