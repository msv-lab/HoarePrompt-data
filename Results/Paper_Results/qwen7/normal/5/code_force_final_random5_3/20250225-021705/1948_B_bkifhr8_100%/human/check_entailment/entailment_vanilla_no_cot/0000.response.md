Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Sorted Order**: The logic inside the loop checks if `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` and then tries to rearrange elements, but it doesn't fully address the problem's requirements. It only checks if the current element is less than the previous one and attempts to sort them, but it does not ensure that the entire array can be made sorted through the allowed operations.

2. **Misinterpretation of Operations**: The code incorrectly assumes that if `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, then it needs to check if the digits of `arr[i-1]` plus `arr[i]` can be sorted. This is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted as a whole.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Digits Operation**: The code attempts to split and recombine numbers, but it does not correctly simulate the process of breaking down larger numbers into their constituent digits and inserting them back into the array. The logic for determining if an array can be sorted after applying the operations is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should consider the following steps:
1. Convert each number in the array to its constituent digits.
2. Use a union-find data structure to group these digits and check if the array can be sorted.
3. Ensure that the operations allow merging of groups of digits in a way that maintains non-decreasing order.

Here is a more appropriate approach:

```python
def can_sort_array(arr):
    # Flatten the array into individual digits
    flat_arr = []
    for num in arr:
        flat_arr.extend(str(num))
    
    # Convert to integers
    flat_arr = [int(digit) for digit in flat_arr]
    
    # Union-Find to group digits
    parent = list(range(len(flat_arr)))
    
    def find(x):
        if parent[x] != x:
            parent[x] = find(parent[x])
        return parent[x]
    
    def union(x, y):
        rootX = find(x)
        rootY = find(y)
        if rootX != rootY:
            parent[rootY] = rootX
    
    # Process each digit
    for i in range(len(flat_arr)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(flat_arr)):
            if flat_arr[i] <= flat_arr[j]:
                union(i, j)
    
    # Check if all digits belong to the same group
    root = find(0)
    for i in range(1, len(flat_arr)):
        if find(i) != root:
            return "NO"
    
    return "YES"

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = can_sort_array(arr)
        print(result)

func()
```

This approach ensures that the array can be checked for being able to be sorted by considering the digits and using a union-find structure to manage the merging of digit groups.
