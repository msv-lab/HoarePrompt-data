Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is less than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers where each element has been processed according to the conditions inside the loop, `ans` is False, `i` is 0, `nums` is no longer defined as it is only used within the loop.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will eventually reach 0 because the loop starts from `m-1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration. The loop breaks when the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is false for all possible `i` values, meaning the array `arr` is non-decreasing or the loop couldn't find any such pair. Since `ans` is set to False as soon as the condition is violated, it remains False. The variable `nums` is only defined and used within the loop, so it is no longer defined after the loop completes.
