Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` changes the value of `ans` from `True` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
