Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
