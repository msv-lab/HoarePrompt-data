Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 2`, `arr[i - 1]` is either equal to the last digit of `arr[i-1]` (if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`), or `arr[i - 1]` is unchanged (if `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`), and `nums` is a list containing the last digit of `arr[i-1]` and the element `arr[i]`.
