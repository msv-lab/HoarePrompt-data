Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the last digit of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` sets the variable `ans` to the boolean value `False`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
