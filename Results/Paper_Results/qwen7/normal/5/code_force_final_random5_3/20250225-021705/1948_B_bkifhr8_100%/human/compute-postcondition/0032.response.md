Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 3`, and if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then the condition is checked and possibly breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, no change occurs.
