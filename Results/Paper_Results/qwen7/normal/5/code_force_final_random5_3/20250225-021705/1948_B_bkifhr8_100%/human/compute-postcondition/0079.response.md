Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and the current value of `nums` is not equal to the sorted version of `nums`.
