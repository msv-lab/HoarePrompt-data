Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` shifted by one and the current element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `ans`. The values of `i`, `m`, `arr`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
