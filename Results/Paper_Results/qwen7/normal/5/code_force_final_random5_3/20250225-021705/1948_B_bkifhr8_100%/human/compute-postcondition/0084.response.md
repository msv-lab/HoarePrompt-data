Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`, `arr[0]` is the first element of the array, and if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then the condition is checked and `i` is decremented by 1.
