Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` is set to False and `i` is decremented by 1. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` remains True and `i` remains `m - 1`.
