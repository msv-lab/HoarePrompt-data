Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers where the element at index `i-1` is now equal to the first element of `nums`, `ans` is False, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
