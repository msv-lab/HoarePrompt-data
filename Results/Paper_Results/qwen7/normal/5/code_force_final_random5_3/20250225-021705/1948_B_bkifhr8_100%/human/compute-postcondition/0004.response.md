Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is True.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected, so their initial states remain unchanged.
