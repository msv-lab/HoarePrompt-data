Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` remains False
   - `i` is `m - 1`
   - `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr` transformed into a list of integers
   - `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first element of `nums`

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `m - 1` to `0` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop starts from `m - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `m - 2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be greater than or equal to 0.

Given this information, let's update the states accordingly:

- `i` will be `m - 2`.
- `nums` will remain the same as it is not modified within the loop body.
- `arr[i - 1]` will be updated to the first element of `nums` since the loop continues to transform and update `arr[i - 1]` based on the current `nums`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr` transformed into a list of integers, and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first element of `nums`**.
