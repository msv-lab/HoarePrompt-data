Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is True, `i` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` is set to False and `i` is decremented by 1. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` remains True and `i` remains `m - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 2`, and `arr[i - 1]` is updated to either the last digit of `arr[i-1]` (if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`) or the last digit of `arr[i]` (if `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 3`, and `arr[i - 1]` is updated to either the last digit of `arr[i-1]` (if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`) or the last digit of `arr[i]` (if `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
