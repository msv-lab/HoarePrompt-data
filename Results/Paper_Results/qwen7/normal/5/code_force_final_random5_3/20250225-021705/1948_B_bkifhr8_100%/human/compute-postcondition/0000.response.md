Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from input and assigns it to `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. The value of `n` is now an integer input between 2 and 50, as specified by the condition in the code comment.
