Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is given as an input integer such that `2 <= n <= 50`, we know that `n` will always be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: The only state that needs adjustment is `n`, ensuring it meets the condition required for the loop to execute. The value of `t` is not relevant to the loop's execution and does not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` being greater than 0.

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0**
