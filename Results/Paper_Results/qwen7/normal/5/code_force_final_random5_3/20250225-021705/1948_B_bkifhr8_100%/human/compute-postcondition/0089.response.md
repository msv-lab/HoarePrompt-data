Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list containing the last digit of `arr[i-1]` and the element `arr[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no such loop or conditional was specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the context in which it was used. The values of `ans`, `i`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
