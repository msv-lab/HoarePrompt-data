Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list containing the last digit of `arr[i-1]` and the element `arr[i]`, and the if condition `nums != sorted(nums)` is satisfied, meaning `nums` is not sorted in ascending order. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains False.
