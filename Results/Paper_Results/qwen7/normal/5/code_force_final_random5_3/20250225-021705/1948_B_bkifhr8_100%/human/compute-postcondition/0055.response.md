Postcondition: **`ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr` transformed into a list of integers. If `nums` is not sorted, the loop or statement is broken; otherwise, no change occurs.**
