Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires rearranging a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that a specified value \(x\) is at the beginning of the permutation after performing a binary search. The binary search should ideally find \(x\) at position \(l\).
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line of space-separated integers and returns a map object.
   - `func_2()` converts the map object returned by `func_1()` into a list.
   - `func_3()`:
     - Takes \(n\) and \(k\) as input, where \(n\) is the length of the permutation and \(k\) is the target value.
     - Uses `func_1()` and `func_2()` to get the permutation list.
     - Finds the position of \(k\) in the permutation.
     - Performs a binary search to find the largest index less than \(k\).
     - Prints the number of operations needed (0, 1, or 2) and the required swaps.

3. **Binary Search and Swapping**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_3()` is implemented correctly, but it does not account for the necessary swaps to place \(k\) at the start.
   - The binary search part is supposed to work on a sorted array, but the problem allows us to perform up to 2 swaps to make the array effectively sorted for the binary search.
   - The function should identify the correct positions to swap to ensure \(k\) is at the start and the binary search works as intended.

4. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The current implementation of `func_3()` does not include the logic to perform the necessary swaps.
   - To fix this, we need to check if \(k\) is already at the start; if not, we need to find the correct positions to swap to move \(k\) to the start and ensure the binary search works correctly.

Given the current implementation, `func_3()` does not include the logic to perform the necessary swaps, which means it cannot meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
