### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
```python
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
```
- This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
- The result is a map object, which is then converted to a list in `func_2`.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
```python
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
```
- This function converts the map object returned by `func_1` into a list.
- The list contains integers representing the test case details and the permutation.

#### Function 3 (`func_3`):
```python
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```
- The function first reads the length of the permutation `n` and the target value `k`.
- It then reads the permutation `arr` as a list.
- It searches for the position of `k` in `arr` using a loop.
- The binary search logic is implemented within the `while` loop, but there is a critical flaw in the logic:
  - When `arr[mid] > k`, the code updates `high = mid`, which is incorrect. It should update `low = mid + 1` to continue the search in the lower half of the array.
- The set `st` is used to store mid values, but it is not necessary for the binary search and does not affect the outcome of the search.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code provides insights into the state of the program at different points.
- The loop in `func_3` correctly identifies the position of `k` in `arr`.
- However, the binary search logic is flawed, as mentioned in the original assessment.

#### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Binary Search Logic Flaw**:
   - When `arr[mid] > k`, the code updates `high = mid`, which is incorrect. It should update `low = mid + 1` to continue the search in the lower half of the array.
   - This error leads to incorrect results when searching for the position of `x`.

2. **Set Usage**:
   - The variable `st` is used to store mid values, but it is not necessary for the binary search and does not affect the outcome of the search.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
  - Input:
    ```
    6 3
    4 3 1 5 2 6
    ```
  - Expected Output:
    - The number 3 should be swapped with the number at position 2 (index 1) to make the permutation `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]` such that `p_l` is equal to 3 after the binary search.
  - Actual Output:
    - The program outputs `0`, indicating no swaps are needed, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality due to the flawed binary search logic. Specifically, the condition `high = mid` when `arr[mid] > k` is incorrect and leads to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
