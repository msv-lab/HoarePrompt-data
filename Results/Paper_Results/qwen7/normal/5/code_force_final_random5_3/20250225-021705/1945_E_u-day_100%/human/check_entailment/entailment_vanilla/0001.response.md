### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires rearranging the permutation `p` using at most 2 swaps so that the element `x` is found at the position `l` after performing a binary search.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The provided code attempts to perform a binary search on the permutation `p`. However, it does not actually perform any swaps to rearrange the permutation. Instead, it directly prints the index of `x` if found, or 0 if not found.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The problem statement mentions that the array must be sorted for binary search, but the provided code does not sort the array. Additionally, the provided code does not implement the logic to perform swaps to place `x` at the correct position.

4. **Output Format**: The output format requires printing the number of swaps and the indices of the elements being swapped. The provided code does not adhere to this format.

5. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
   - Identify the positions of `x` in the permutation.
   - Determine the necessary swaps to move `x` to the correct position.
   - Perform the swaps and then run the binary search.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps before performing the binary search. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
