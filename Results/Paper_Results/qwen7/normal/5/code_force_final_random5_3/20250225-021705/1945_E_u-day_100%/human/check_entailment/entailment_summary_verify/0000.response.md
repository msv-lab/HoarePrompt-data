### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Function Summaries:
- **Function 3**: Searches for the position of `k` in `arr` and performs a binary search to find the largest index less than `k` if `k` is not found. It prints either 0 or 1 based on whether `k` is found, and if 1 is printed, it also prints the indices of `k` and the largest index less than `k`.

#### Analysis of Function 3:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `pos = -1`: Initialize the position of `k` to -1.
   - `low = 0` and `high = n`: Initialize the binary search bounds.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - `mid = (low + high) // 2`: Calculate the middle index.
   - `st.add(mid)`: Add the middle index to a set (not used in the logic).
   - `if arr[mid] > k`: This condition checks if the middle element is greater than `k`.
     - **Incorrect Logic**: The code updates `high = mid`, which is incorrect. It should update `low = mid + 1` to continue the search in the right half.
     - **Correct Logic**: It should update `low = mid + 1` to continue the search in the left half.

3. **Finding the Position**:
   - After the loop, if `arr[low] == k`, it prints `0` and exits.
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and then prints the indices of `k` and the largest index less than `k`.

#### Detailed Example:
Consider the test case:
- Input:
  ```
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The number 3 should be swapped with the number at position 2 (index 1) to make the permutation `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]` such that `p_l` is equal to 3 after the binary search.

- Actual Output:
  - The program outputs `0`, indicating no swaps are needed, which is incorrect.

#### Corrected Implementation:
To fix the binary search logic, we need to update the `low` pointer correctly when `arr[mid] > k`.

```python
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n)
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the flaw in the binary search logic. The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality due to the incorrect update of the `low` pointer in the binary search loop. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
