Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` is used as the upper limit for the range function.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `pos` is -1.
   - `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
   - `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because the `range(n)` function will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to 0 since the loop starts iterating from 0.

5. **Final State After Adjustment**:
   - `pos` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` should be 0 initially.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`pos` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
