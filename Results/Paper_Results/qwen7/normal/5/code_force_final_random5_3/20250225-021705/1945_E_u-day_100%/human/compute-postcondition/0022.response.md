Output State: **`pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` is greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is added to set `st`.**

Explanation: The line `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which remains unchanged from its previous value. All other variables retain their initial conditions or relationships.
