Output State: **`pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` and `high` are updated based on the value of `arr[mid]` relative to `k`, `mid` is added to set `st` twice, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is added to set `st` again, and `low + 1 < high` must hold true; `mid` is reassigned to the value of `(low + high) // 2`**

This output state reflects that the line of code `mid = (low + high) // 2` updates the value of `mid` to the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
