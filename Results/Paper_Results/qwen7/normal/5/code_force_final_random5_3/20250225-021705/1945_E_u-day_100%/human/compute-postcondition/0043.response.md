Postcondition: `pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` and `high` are updated based on the value of `arr[mid]` relative to `k`, `mid` is added to set `st` three times, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, and `low + 1 < high` must hold true; `mid` is reassigned to the value of `(low + high) // 2. This means that after executing the if-else block, `pos` remains 2, `n` stays greater than 0, `i` is still `n-1`, and the search range for `k` is narrowed down by updating `low` and `high` accordingly, while `mid` is updated and added to the set `st` three times.
