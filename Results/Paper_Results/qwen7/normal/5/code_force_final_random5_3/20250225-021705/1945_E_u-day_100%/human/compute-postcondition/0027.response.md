Output State: **`pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` is equal to `mid`, `high` is greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is added to set `st`, and `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`**.

Explanation: The line `low = mid` updates the value of `low` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
