Output State: **`pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` and `high` are updated such that `high` is now equal to `mid`, `mid` is added to set `st` three times, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, and `low + 1 < high` must hold true; `mid` is reassigned to the value of `(low + high) // 2**.

Explanation: The code `high = mid` updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
