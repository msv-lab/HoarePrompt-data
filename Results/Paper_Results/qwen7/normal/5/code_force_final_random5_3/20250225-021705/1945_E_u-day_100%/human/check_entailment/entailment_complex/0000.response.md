Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a map object containing these integers. This is used to read the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function calls `func_1()` and returns a list generated by `func_1()`. Given that `func_1()` returns a map object, `func_2()` will convert this map object into a list. This list should contain the permutation `p` for each test case.
3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is supposed to rearrange the permutation `arr` so that the binary search can find the target value `k` at the start of the array `p`. The function performs the following steps:
   - Finds the position `pos` of `k` in `arr`.
   - Performs a binary search to find the largest index `m` in `arr` such that `arr[m] <= k`.
   - Depending on the result of the binary search, it prints the number of swaps needed (0 or 1) and the indices of the swaps if necessary.

Given the problem statement, the function `func_3` should rearrange the permutation such that the binary search starts with the target value `k` at the beginning of the array. However, the current implementation of `func_3` does not actually perform any swaps to achieve this. Instead, it performs a binary search and prints the result based on the outcome of the search. The binary search itself is not incorrect, but the function does not fulfill the requirement to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps.

Since the problem requires rearranging the permutation using at most 2 swaps, and `func_3` does not implement this part, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
