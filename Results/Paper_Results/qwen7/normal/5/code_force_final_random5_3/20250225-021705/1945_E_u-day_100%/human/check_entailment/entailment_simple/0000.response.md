### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined but their implementations are not provided. Based on the context, `func_1` likely reads and splits the input into integers, and `func_2` converts the result of `func_1` into a list.

2. **Main Function Logic**:
   - The main function `func_3` takes the length of the permutation `n` and the target value `k`.
   - It then finds the position of `k` in the permutation `arr`.
   - The binary search is performed to find the correct position for `k` using the indices `low` and `high`.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search logic is implemented correctly. It uses a set `st` to store the midpoints where the target value `k` is not found, which is unnecessary for the binary search itself but might be used for other purposes.
   - The loop continues until `low + 1 >= high`, and it correctly updates `low` and `high` based on whether `arr[mid]` is greater or less than `k`.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` indicating the positions to swap.

Given the provided comments and the logic of the code, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality. The binary search is performed correctly, and the necessary swaps are identified and printed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: **True**
