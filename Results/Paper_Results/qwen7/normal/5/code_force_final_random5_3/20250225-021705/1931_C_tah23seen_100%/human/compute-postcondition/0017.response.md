Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will continue to decrement until it reaches 0. Since the loop condition checks if `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`, once `j` reaches 0, the condition `j > 0` will fail, and the loop will stop. At this point, `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to the length of `arr`, indicating that there were no breaks in the sequence of identical elements from the start of the array up to the point where `j` is 0.
