### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(arr)` to calculate the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal.
   - The result of `func_1(arr)` is printed for each test case.
   - This part is also correct.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - However, the logic inside the function is flawed. Let's break it down step-by-step:
     - The function initializes `i` to 0 and `j` to the last index of the array.
     - It then tries to find the rightmost segment starting from the beginning where all elements are the same (`arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`).
     - Similarly, it tries to find the leftmost segment ending from the end where all elements are the same (`arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`).
     - The logic to set `i` and `j` is incorrect because it does not properly handle the case where the array has multiple segments of identical values.
     - If the first and last elements are the same, it returns the length of the segment from `i` to `j - 1`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of changing the entire array to a single value.
     - The logic to return the minimum cost between changing the entire array except the prefix of length `i` to the last element and changing the entire array except the suffix of length `n - j` to the first element is also incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of changing the entire array to a single value.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the array has multiple segments of identical values, the function may incorrectly determine the positions of `i` and `j`.
   - The function does not consider the scenario where the entire array can be made equal by a single operation, which is the simplest and most optimal solution.

5. **Output**:
   - The function does not output the correct minimum cost for all test cases. For example, in the test case `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the correct answer should be 4 (changing the array to `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`), but the function returns 0, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. The function `func_1` has logical errors and does not handle edge cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
