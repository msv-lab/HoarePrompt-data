Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not account for all possible scenarios where the minimum cost can be achieved.

Consider the following example:
- Input:
```
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
- Expected Output: `4`
- Actual Output: `4`

This example seems to work correctly, but consider another scenario:
- Input:
```
6
1 2 3 3 3 1
```
- Expected Output: `3` (We can change the entire array to the value `3` with one operation.)
- Actual Output: `4` (The program incorrectly calculates the cost as `4`.)

The program fails to handle cases where the minimum cost can be achieved by selecting a subarray that includes repeated values. The logic in `func_1` does not properly identify such cases, leading to incorrect results.
