You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical.
    #
    #This means that the loop continues to increment `i` as long as the current element is equal to the next one, effectively skipping over consecutive duplicates. Once `i` reaches a point where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or it reaches the second last element of the array, the loop stops. At the end, `i` will be at the position right after the last group of consecutive duplicates, or at the end of the array if there were no duplicates. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will eventually reach 0 because the loop decrements `j` by 1 each time it finds that `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`. Since the loop stops when `j` is no longer greater than 0, `j` will be 0 at the end. Also, since the loop only increments `i` when it skips over consecutive duplicates, `i` will always be equal to the length of `arr` because the condition to increment `i` is never met (as the loop only affects `j`). All elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` (which is the entire array) are identical due to the initial condition and the nature of the loop.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between j (which is 0) and i (which is the length of arr), minus 1.
    #State: `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` (which is the entire array) are not identical.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1 and j) and 0, where n is the length of the array arr, i is the length of arr, and j is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers. It returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between 0 and the length of arr, minus 1. In another case, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (length of arr - 1 and 0) and 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between j (which is 0) and i (which is the length of arr), minus 1.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1 and j) and 0, where n is the length of the array arr, i is the length of arr, and j is 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
