Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - The first while loop (`while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:`) increments `i` until it finds a non-duplicate element or reaches the second-to-last element of the array. This ensures that `i` points to the end of the first segment of duplicate elements.
   - The second while loop (`while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:`) decrements `j` until it finds a non-duplicate element or reaches the first element of the array. This ensures that `j` points to the start of the last segment of duplicate elements.
   - The logic then checks if the entire array consists of identical elements. If so, it calculates the cost as `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - If the entire array does not consist of identical elements, it calculates the cost as `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation in both scenarios is correct. If the entire array is uniform, the cost is the length of the segment that needs to be changed, which is `j - i - 1` (since `i` and `j` are at the boundaries of the segments).
   - If the array is not uniform, the cost is the minimum of changing the prefix or the suffix of the array, ensuring that the cost is minimized.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same and arrays with no uniform segments correctly.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

Correctness: **True**
