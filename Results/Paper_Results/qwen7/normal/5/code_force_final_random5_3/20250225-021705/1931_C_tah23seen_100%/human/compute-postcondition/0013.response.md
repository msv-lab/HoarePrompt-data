Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to the length of `arr`.
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 2.
   - All elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `j > 0` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` must be true.
   - Given that `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, `j` is non-negative (since `j` starts from the second last element of the array).
   - The condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` checks if the current element `arr[j]` is equal to the previous element `arr[j - 1]`.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, `j` is already set to a valid index where the comparison can be made.
   - The only way to ensure the loop continues is to maintain the condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` true. This means the elements `arr[j]` and `arr[j - 1]` must remain equal.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs adjustment is the value of `arr[j]` and `arr[j - 1]` to ensure they remain equal.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical, and `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`**.
