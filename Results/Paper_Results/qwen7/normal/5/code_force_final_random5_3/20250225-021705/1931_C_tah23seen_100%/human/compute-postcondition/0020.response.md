Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between j (which is 0) and i (which is the length of arr), minus 1.**

Given the initial state:
- `i` is equal to the length of `arr`.
- `j` is 0.
- All elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical.
- The first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`.

The expression `max(j - i - 1, 0)` simplifies as follows:
- Since `j` is 0, `j - i - 1` becomes `-i - 1`.
- Because `i` is the length of `arr`, which is a positive integer, `-i - 1` will always be less than 0.
- Therefore, `max(-i - 1, 0)` will return 0.

Thus, the program returns 0.
