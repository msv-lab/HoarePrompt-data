Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to the length of `arr`.
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 3.
   - All elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical.
   - `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

3. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on `j` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` is the length of `arr` - 3, for the loop to continue, `j` must be greater than 0. Currently, `j` is already set to `len(arr) - 3`, which means `j` is non-negative but we need to ensure it is greater than 0.
   - Additionally, `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]` for the loop to continue.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `j` is greater than 0 and `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `j` must be greater than 0.
- `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

State: **`i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` must be greater than 0, and `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`**
