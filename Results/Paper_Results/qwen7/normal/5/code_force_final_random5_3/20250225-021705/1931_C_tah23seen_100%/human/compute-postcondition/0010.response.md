Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical.

This means that the loop continues to increment `i` as long as the current element is equal to the next one, effectively skipping over consecutive duplicates. Once `i` reaches a point where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or it reaches the second last element of the array, the loop stops. At the end, `i` will be at the position right after the last group of consecutive duplicates, or at the end of the array if there were no duplicates. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
