Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is different from 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, 99999999, `x` is halved.**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides the current value of `x` by 2 using integer division (which discards the fractional part). Since `x` was initially different from 1, its new value is half of its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
