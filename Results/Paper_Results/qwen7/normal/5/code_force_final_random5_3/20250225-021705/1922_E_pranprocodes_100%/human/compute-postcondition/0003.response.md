Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value `-100000000` to the variable `min`. This changes the value of `min` but does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, or `max`. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
