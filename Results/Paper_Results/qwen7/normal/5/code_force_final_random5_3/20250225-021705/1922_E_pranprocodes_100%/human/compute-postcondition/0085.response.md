Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is set to 1.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1. Since `x` is already 1, `t` would be 0.
   - `max` is set to 99999997.
   - `min` is set to 1.
   - `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting from `max` and reversed. Given `max` is 99999997 and `min` is 1, `ans` would be `[99999997, 1]`.
   - `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations, so `i` would be 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

Given this information, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces. Since `ans` is `[99999997, 1]`, the output will be:

Output: **99999997 1**
