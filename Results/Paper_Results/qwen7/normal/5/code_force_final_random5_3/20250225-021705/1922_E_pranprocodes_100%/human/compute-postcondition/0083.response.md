Output State: **`x` is 1, `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1 following the given rules, `max` is 99999997, `min` is 1, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting from `max` and reversed, `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations.**

Explanation: The code `ans.reverse()` reverses the list `ans`. Since `ans` was initially a list containing alternating values starting with `max` and decreasing by 1 each step until `min`, reversing it will start with `min` and increase by 1 each step until `max`. All other variables remain unchanged.
