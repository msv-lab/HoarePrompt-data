Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is either `x` // 2 if `x` is even, or different from 0 if `x` is odd, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 if `x` is even or -100000000 if `x` is odd.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the line `t += 1`.
