Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is different from 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing -99999999**

Explanation: The variable `min` is incremented by 1. Initially, `min` was -99999999. After adding 1 to `-99999999`, the new value of `min` becomes `-99999998`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `x`, `max`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
