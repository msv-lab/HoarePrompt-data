Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans.append(max)
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans.append(min)
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `x` is either `x` // 2 if `x` is even, or different from 0 if `x` is odd, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 if `x` is even or -100000000 if `x` is odd.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 2, `x` is either 0 or halved if it was even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing either -99999999 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` was even or odd.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 3, `x` is a positive integer, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing 99999999 if `x` was initially an even number greater than 1, otherwise `ans` is a list containing -99999998 and `x` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
