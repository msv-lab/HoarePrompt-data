Output State: The value of `x` will eventually become 1, `t` will be equal to the total number of iterations (which is the number of times the loop executed), `ans` will be a list containing alternating values of `max` decremented and `min` incremented until `x` becomes 1, `max` will be equal to `-100000000 - t` and `min` will be equal to `100000000 + t`.

This means that as the loop progresses, `max` decreases by 1 each time `x` is even, and `min` increases by 1 each time `x` is odd, until `x` reaches 1. The total number of iterations `t` will be the count of how many times the loop ran, which is the sum of the decrements and increments applied to `max` and `min`.
