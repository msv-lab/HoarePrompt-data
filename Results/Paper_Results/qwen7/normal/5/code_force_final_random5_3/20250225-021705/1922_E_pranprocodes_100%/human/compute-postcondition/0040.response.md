Output State: **`t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is now 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing alternating values starting from `max` (99999998) and decreasing by 1 each time until `min` (-99999998), and `ans` has been reversed.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.reverse()` reverses the list `ans`.
- The values of `t`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged.
- The list `ans` is now in reverse order, meaning it starts from `-99999998` and increases by 1 each time until `99999998`.
