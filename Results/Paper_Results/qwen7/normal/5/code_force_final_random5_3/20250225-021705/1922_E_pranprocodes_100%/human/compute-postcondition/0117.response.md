Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1 divided by 2, `t` is an input integer increased by 2, `ans` is a list containing the function `max`, `max` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides the value of `x` by 2 using integer division. Since `x` is initially an input integer not equal to 1, after the operation, `x` becomes an input integer not equal to 1 divided by 2. The values of `t`, `ans`, and `max` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
