Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the value of `int(input())` is a non-negative integer. However, since the problem specifies that `t` (which is the input for `int(input())`) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), we know that `int(input())` will always return a valid non-negative integer within this range.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute. This means we need to set `t` (the input) to a value within the specified range. Since `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer between 1 and 1000, we can simply state that `t` must be within this range.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is a positive integer within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**
