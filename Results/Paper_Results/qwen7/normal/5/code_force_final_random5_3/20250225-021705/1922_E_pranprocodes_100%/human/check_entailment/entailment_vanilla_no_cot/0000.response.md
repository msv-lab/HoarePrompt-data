Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Generating Increasing Subsequences:**
   - The logic in the given program tries to generate an array where the number of increasing subsequences is equal to `x` by appending either the maximum or minimum value based on whether `x` is even or odd.
   - This approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `x` increasing subsequences. It may produce arrays with more than `x` increasing subsequences or fail to produce the exact count.

2. **Handling of Test Cases:**
   - For certain values of `x`, the program may not find a valid array and instead produce an incorrect result or an array with too many increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is a prime number greater than 2, which cannot be achieved with the current logic.

### Example Counter-Case:
Consider the input `x = 37`. The expected output should be an array of length 7 with the specific sequence `-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`, but the provided program does not produce this output.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, one would need to use combinatorial methods to construct the array. One possible method involves using factorization and combinatorial properties to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences is achieved.

Here is a conceptual outline of a correct solution:
1. Factorize `x` into its prime factors.
2. Use these factors to construct the array in a way that ensures the exact number of increasing subsequences.

Since the provided program does not implement this correct logic, it is marked as incorrect.
