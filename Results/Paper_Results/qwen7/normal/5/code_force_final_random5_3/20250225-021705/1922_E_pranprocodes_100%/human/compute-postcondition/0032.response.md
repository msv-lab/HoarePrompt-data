Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is an even number that has been halved and is now a positive integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing -99999998**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `min` is -99999998. After appending, the list `ans` will contain -99999998. All other variables remain unchanged.
