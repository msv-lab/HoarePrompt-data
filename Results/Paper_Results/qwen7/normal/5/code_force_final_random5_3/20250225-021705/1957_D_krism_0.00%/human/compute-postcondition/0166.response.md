Output State: **`ans` is increased by `pre[4][0] * suf[4][1] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][0]`, `j` is 30, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `pre[31][0]` is 2, `pre[31][1]` is 32, `suf[31][1]` is -32, `k` is 4, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, and `(c >> 31 & 1)` is 0**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Initially, `j` is 31, so `suf[31][0]` is decremented by 1. Since `suf[31][0]` was initially 2, after decrementing, its new value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
