Output State: `pre` is a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is [32, 0]; `suf` is a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is [0, 0]; `i` is 32; `n` is 32.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all 32 iterations, each sublist in `pre` will have its first element set to 32 (since `pre[i][0] += 1` was executed 32 times for each `i`), while the second element remains 0. The variable `suf` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to 32 (one past the last index processed in the loop), and `n` retains its initial value of 32.
