Output State: **`i` is 32, `j` is between 0 and 31 inclusive, and the current value of `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Since `j` must be between 0 and 31 inclusive, and the current value of `(cur >> j & 1)` is true, it means that `j` is one of the bits in the binary representation of `i` (which is 32) that is set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `suf[j][1]`.
