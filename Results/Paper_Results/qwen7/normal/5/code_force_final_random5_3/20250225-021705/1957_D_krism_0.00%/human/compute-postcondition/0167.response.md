Postcondition: `ans` is increased by either `pre[4][0] * suf[4][0] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][1]` or `pre[4][0] * suf[4][1] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][0]`, depending on whether the `j`-th bit of `c` is set to 1. Specifically, if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, then `ans` is increased by `pre[4][0] * suf[4][0] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][1]`, where `j` is 30, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `pre[31][1]` is 32, and `suf[31][1]` is -32. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `pre[4][0] * suf[4][1] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][0]`, where `j` is 30, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `pre[31][0]` is 2, `pre[31][1]` is 32, `suf[31][1]` is -32, and `k` is 4, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`.
