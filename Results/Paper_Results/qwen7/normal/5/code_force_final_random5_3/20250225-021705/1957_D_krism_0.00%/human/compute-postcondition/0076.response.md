Output State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 31, `cur` is the value of `prefix[30]`, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31, `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range, and `(cur >> j & 1)` is false; `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1 for each `j` from 0 to 31. Since `suf[j][0]` originally contains the count of bits set to 0 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31, incrementing it by 1 means it now contains one more zero bit in that range. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
