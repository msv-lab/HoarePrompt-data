Output State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 31, `cur` is the value of `prefix[30]`, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range.**

Explanation: The code `cur = prefix[i]` assigns the value of `prefix[30]` to the variable `cur`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `i` is now 30, `j` is still 31, and `cur` holds the value of `prefix[30]`. The counts stored in `suf[j][1]` and `suf[j][0]` for all `j` from 0 to 31 remain the same as they were before this assignment.
