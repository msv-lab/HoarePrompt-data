Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `v` and `arr`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `arr` contains at least one element.
3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `prefix` is `[0, v ^ 0]`
   - `arr` must contain at least one element

4. **Analyze what happens in each iteration**:
   - In each iteration, `v` takes the value of an element from `arr`.
   - After processing `v`, the element is removed from `arr`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `v` is used within the loop body but not stored or modified outside the loop, its value does not need to be adjusted.
   - For the loop to execute again, `arr` must still contain at least one element.

Given that `arr` must contain at least one element at the start of the next iteration, and assuming that one element has been processed (and thus removed) in the previous iteration, `arr` must now contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `arr` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`prefix` is [0, v ^ 0], `arr` must contain at least one element**
