Output State: **`i` is 32; `j` is 1; `suf[j][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the first element of the list `suf[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, `suf[j][0]` is equivalent to `suf[1][0]`. Since no initial value for `suf[1][0]` was provided, we assume it starts at 0. After executing `suf[j][0] += 1`, the value of `suf[1][0]` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
