Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `0` to `31`, inclusive.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 31.
   - `j` is 0.
   - The postcondition states that if `(cur >> j & 1)` is true, then `suf[0][1]` is 1. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is 1.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**:
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `31`, the next value of `j` after `0` would be `1`.

4. **Evaluate the Postcondition for the New Value of `j`**:
   - We need to check the condition `(cur >> j & 1)` for `j = 1`.
   - Based on the result of this condition, either `suf[0][1]` or `suf[1][0]` will be updated.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `j`, so we need to update `j` to `1`.
   - The values of `i` and the postcondition related to `suf` will remain as they were because they are not directly affected by the loop incrementing `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 31, `j` is 1**.

The postcondition will be evaluated based on the new value of `j` (`1`) during the next iteration.
