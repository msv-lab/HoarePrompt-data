Output State: **`i` is 31; `j` is 1; `suf[j][0]` is 1**

The code increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, `suf[j][0]` which was previously unspecified (but assuming it started as 0 since no initial value is given), is now 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
