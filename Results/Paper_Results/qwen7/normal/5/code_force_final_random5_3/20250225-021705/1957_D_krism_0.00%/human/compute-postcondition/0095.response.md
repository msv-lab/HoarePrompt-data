Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - According to the given state, `i` is currently 0.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `n`:**
   - The initial state of `n` is not explicitly mentioned. However, since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to adjust `i` to be 1.
   - We also need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
