Based on the initial state provided, the variables and objects are described as follows:

- `t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- The list `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).

The print statement in question is:

```python
print('-----------------')
```

This statement simply prints a string containing 13 hyphens.

Output: **-----------------**
