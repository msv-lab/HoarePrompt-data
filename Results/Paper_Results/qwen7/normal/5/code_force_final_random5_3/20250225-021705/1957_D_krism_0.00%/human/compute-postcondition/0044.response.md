Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` remains 32, `j` is 31, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, if the bit at position `j` in `i` (which is 32) is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is equal to the count of 1s at that bit position across all bits of `i`, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is equal to the count of 0s at that bit position.**

To break it down further:
- The variable `i` starts at 32 and does not change throughout the loop.
- The variable `j` starts at 0 and increments up to 31 over the course of the loop.
- For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, the loop checks if the bit at that position in the binary representation of `i` (which is 32, or `100000` in binary) is 1 or 0.
- Since `i` is 32, its binary form is `100000`, which has only one '1' at the 5th bit position (from the right, starting at 0).
- Therefore, `suf[j][1]` will be 1 for `j = 5` and `suf[j][0]` will be 1 for all other `j` values from 0 to 31.
