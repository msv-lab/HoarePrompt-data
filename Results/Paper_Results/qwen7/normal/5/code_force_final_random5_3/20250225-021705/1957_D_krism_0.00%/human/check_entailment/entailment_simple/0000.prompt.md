Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

# Annotated Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; and the list a is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    #This is printed: -----------------
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: The `prefix` list will contain the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to each index, starting with 0. Specifically, `prefix[i]` will be the result of `v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vi` for each `i` from 0 to the length of `arr`.
    #
    #For example, if `arr = [a, b, c, d]`, then after the loop completes, `prefix` will be `[0, a ^ 0, (b ^ a) ^ (a ^ 0), ((c ^ b) ^ (b ^ a)) ^ ((a ^ 0)), ((d ^ c) ^ ((c ^ b) ^ (b ^ a))) ^ (((c ^ b) ^ (b ^ a)) ^ ((a ^ 0)))]`, which simplifies to `[0, a, b ^ a, c ^ b ^ a, d ^ c ^ b ^ a]`.
    #
    #This means that `prefix[i]` represents the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to the `i`-th element.
    print(arr, prefix)
    #This is printed: Output:
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `pre` is a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is [32, 0]; `suf` is a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is [0, 0]; `i` is 32; `n` is 32.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all 32 iterations, each sublist in `pre` will have its first element set to 32 (since `pre[i][0] += 1` was executed 32 times for each `i`), while the second element remains 0. The variable `suf` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to 32 (one past the last index processed in the loop), and `n` retains its initial value of 32.
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `cur` is the value of `prefix[0]`, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the total count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur`, and `suf[j][0]` contains the total count of bits set to 0 in the same range.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all 32 iterations, `i` will be 0 (one past the last index processed in the loop), and `j` will be 0 (as the loop decrements `j` from 31 to 0). The variable `cur` will hold the value of `prefix[0]` since `cur` is initialized with `prefix[i]` and `i` starts from 32 and decreases to 0. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` will contain the total number of 1s in the binary representation of `cur` (since it counts 1s from position `j` to 31, and after 32 iterations, this covers all bits), and `suf[j][0]` will contain the total number of 0s in the same range.
    print(pre)
    #This is printed: prefix[0]
    print(suf)
    #This is printed: [[total_number_of_1s_in_val, total_number_of_0s_in_val]]
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        
        c = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is increased by `pre[4][0] * suf[31][0] + pre[4][1] * suf[31][1]`, where `pre[4][0]` is the count of bits set to 0 in the 4th bit position, `pre[4][1]` is the count of bits set to 1 in the 4th bit position, `suf[31][0]` is the count of bits set to 0 in the last 32 bits, and `suf[31][1]` is the count of bits set to 1 in the last 32 bits. After the loop completes, `pre[31][0]` is 32, indicating there are 32 zeros in the most significant bit position, and `suf[31][0]` is -32, indicating there are 32 more zeros than ones in the last 32 bits. The variable `j` resets to 31, and `k` remains at 4, with `c` and `y` retaining their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `ans` is updated based on the final counts of 0s and 1s in specific bit positions, and the counts of 0s and 1s in the last 32 bits are finalized. The variable `j` is reset to 31, and `k` remains at 4, with `c` and `y` holding their values from the last loop iteration.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is updated based on the final counts of 0s and 1s in the 4th bit position and the last 32 bits, with pre[31][0] being 32 and suf[31][0] being -32)
