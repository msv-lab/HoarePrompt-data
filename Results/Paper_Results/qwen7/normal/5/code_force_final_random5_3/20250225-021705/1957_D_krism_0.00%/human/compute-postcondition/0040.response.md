Output State: **`i` is 32; `j` is 1; `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1**

Given the initial state where `i` is 32 and `j` is 1, the code snippet `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Since `j` is 1, this means `suf[1][1]` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
