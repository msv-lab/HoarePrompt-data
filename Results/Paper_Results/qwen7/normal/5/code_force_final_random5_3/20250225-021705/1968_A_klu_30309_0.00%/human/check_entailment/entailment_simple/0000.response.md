Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` aims to find the optimal \( y \).
   - It iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2 (since \( y < x \)).
   - For each \( y \), it checks if \( x \% y == 0 \) (i.e., \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \)).
   - If \( y \) is a divisor and \( 2 * y \ge x \), it returns \( y \) immediately because this would maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
   - Otherwise, it updates `max_val` to the current \( y \) if it's larger than the current `max_val`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no \( y \) satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \), the function returns `max_val`, which is initialized to 1. This ensures a valid output even if no better \( y \) is found.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The program correctly prints the result of `func_1(x)` for each test case.
   - Given the constraints and logic, the function should work as intended within the specified range.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and should find the correct \( y \) for each \( x \) within the given constraints.
   - The approach of checking divisors and updating `max_val` ensures that the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is found.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
