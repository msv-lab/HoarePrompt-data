Output State: **The program returns the value of y, which must be a divisor of x and x must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 times the value of y.**

Given the initial conditions:
- `max_val` is 1 (though this variable is not directly involved in the return statement)
- `x` must be greater than 1 and divisible by `y`
- The current value of `x` is less than or equal to 2 times the value of `y`

The return statement simply returns the value of `y`. Therefore, the output state is that the program returns the value of `y`, which satisfies the conditions mentioned above.
