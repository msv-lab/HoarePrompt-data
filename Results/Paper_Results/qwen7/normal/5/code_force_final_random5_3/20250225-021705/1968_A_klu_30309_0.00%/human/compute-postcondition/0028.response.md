Output State: **The program returns max_val which is set to the largest value of y where 2 * y is less than or equal to x, if no such y exists, max_val remains 1.**

This means that the program returns the maximum value of `y` found during the loop's execution, under the condition that `2 * y` is less than or equal to `x`. If no such `y` exists, the value of `max_val` remains 1.
