Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the value of `x` for each test case and calls the function `func_1(x)` to find the appropriate `y`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function aims to find `y` such that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.
   - It iterates over possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to `2` (since `y` must be less than `x`).
   - For each `y`, it checks if `x % y == 0` (i.e., `y` is a divisor of `x`).
   - If `y` is a divisor and `2 * y >= x`, it returns `y` immediately because this condition ensures that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.
   - If no such `y` is found during the loop, it returns the last `y` that was checked (which is stored in `max_val`).

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `x = 2`, the only possible `y` is `1` since `1` is the only number less than `2`. The function correctly returns `1`.
   - For `x = 3`, the only possible `y` is `1` or `2`. Since `2` is not a divisor, the function returns `1`.
   - For `x = 4`, the divisors are `1` and `2`. Since `2` is a divisor and `2 * 2 >= 4`, the function returns `2`.

2. **General Case:**
   - The function iterates backward from `x-1` to `2` and finds the largest `y` that is a divisor of `x` and satisfies `2 * y >= x`.
   - This approach ensures that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized because the greatest common divisor will be maximized when `y` is a large divisor of `x`.

3. **Output Validation:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the expected behavior of the function.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible value of `gcd(x, y) + y` for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
