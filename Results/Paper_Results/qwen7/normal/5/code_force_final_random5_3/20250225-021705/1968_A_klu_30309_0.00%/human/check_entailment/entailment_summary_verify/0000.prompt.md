You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    10

    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        y = func_1(x)
        print(y)

def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:
                return y
            max_val = y
    return max_val



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer \( x \) such that \( 2 \leq x \leq 1000 \). It returns the largest integer \( y \) that satisfies one of the following conditions:
1. \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) and \( x > 1 \) and \( x \leq 2y \).
2. \( x \) is divisible by \( y-1 \) and \( 2(y-1) < x \).
3. \( y = x - 2 \) when \( x > 2 \).
If no such \( y \) exists, it returns 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always find the correct value of \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Specifically, consider the test case \( x = 10 \):

- The program will check values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
- For \( y = 9 \), \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
- For \( y = 5 \), \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).

Both \( y = 9 \) and \( y = 5 \) give the same maximum value of 10. However, the program returns \( y = 5 \) because it finds the first \( y \) that satisfies the condition \( 2 \cdot y \geq x \), which is true for \( y = 5 \) but not for \( y = 9 \).

Since the problem statement asks for any \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\), the program should return either 5 or 9, but it only returns 5. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
