Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `y` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `y` values starting from `x - 1` down to 2 (since the step is `-1`).

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_val` is `y`.
   - `x` must be greater than 1.
   - Either `x` is divisible by `y` with `2 * y` less than `x`, or there is no alternative action specified in the else part.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `y` by 1 each time, the next value of `y` will be `y - 1`.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The condition `x > 1` must still hold true.
   - The condition related to divisibility (`x % y == 0 and 2 * y < x`) must also still hold true if it was true in the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `max_val` becomes `y - 1`.
- `x` remains the same.
- `x` must still be greater than 1.
- The divisibility condition must still hold true if it was true before.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`max_val` is `y - 1`, `x` is the same, `x` must be greater than 1, and either `x` is divisible by `y - 1` with `2 * (y - 1)` less than `x`, or there is no alternative action specified in the else part.**
