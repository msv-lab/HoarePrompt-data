Functionality: **The function accepts an integer x such that 2 <= x <= 1000. It returns y under different conditions:**
- If x has a divisor y such that x > 1 and x <= 2*y, it returns y.
- If x is divisible by y-1 and 2*(y-1) < x, it returns y.
- If x > 2, it returns x - 2.
- Otherwise, it returns the largest value of y where 2 * y <= x, with a default of 1 if no such y exists.
