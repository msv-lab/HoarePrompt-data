Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value, `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1, `tleftZero` is 3 if `s[right]` is '0' and 2 if `s[right]` is '1', `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', `right` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, and `t` is `t-1`.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
