Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `mid + 2`, and `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The values of `total` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `total` is still 0, `i` is still `mid + 2`, and `rightZero` has been increased by 1.
