Output State: `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `\(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\)` and greater than or equal to 0, `trightZero` is less than or equal to 0, `trightOne` is less than or equal to 0, `tleftOne` is greater than or equal to `\(\left\lceil \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rceil\)` and less than or equal to `n`, and `left` is equal to 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the condition `right < n` will no longer be satisfied because `right` will be equal to `n`. The loop continues to increment `right` until it reaches `n`. During each iteration, `tleftZero` can either stay the same or increase by 1, but it must eventually be less than or equal to half of `n + 1` because the loop exits when `tleftZero` meets or exceeds this threshold. Similarly, `trightZero` and `trightOne` will be reduced until they are zero or negative, as the loop decreases these counters with each iteration. `tleftOne` will keep increasing until it reaches or exceeds half of `n + 1`, ensuring that the total number of ones on the left side of the split is at least half of the total number of elements. `left` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
