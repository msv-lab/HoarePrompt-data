Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is greater than 1, `leftZero` is 5, and `leftOne` is 4**

Explanation: The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Given that `leftZero` was either 4 or `leftOne` was 4 (and `leftOne` remains unchanged), after incrementing, `leftZero` becomes 5. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
