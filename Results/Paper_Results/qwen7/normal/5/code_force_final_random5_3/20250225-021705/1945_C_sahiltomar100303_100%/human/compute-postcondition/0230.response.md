Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `leftZero` must be less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `s[left - 1]` is not '0'**.

The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The condition that `s[left - 1]` is not '0' remains valid.
