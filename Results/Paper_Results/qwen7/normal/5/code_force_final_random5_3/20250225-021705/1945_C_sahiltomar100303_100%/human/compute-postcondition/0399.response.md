Output State: **`left` is `mid - 2`, `leftZero` is `trightZero + rightZero`, and `rightOne` is `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1. Given the initial condition `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`, after incrementing `rightOne` by 1, its new value is `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1`. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, `trightZero`, `rightZero`, and `n` remain unchanged.
