Postcondition: `right` is equal to `n`, `left` remains 0, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `trightZero` is greater than or equal to 0, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `tleftOne` is greater than or equal to 0. If `left == 0`, the postcondition holds under the following conditions: either `right != n`, or `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, or `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left != 0`, the postcondition holds with the additional adjustment that if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2` while keeping other conditions intact. Additionally, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.
