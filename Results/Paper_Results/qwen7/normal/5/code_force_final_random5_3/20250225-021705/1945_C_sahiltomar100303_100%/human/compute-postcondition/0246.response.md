Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n-4`, `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, `i` was `n-3`. After decrementing `leftOne`, `i` becomes `n-4`. The conditions for `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the operation.
