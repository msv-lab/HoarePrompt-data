Output State: **`left` is `mid - 2`, `leftZero` is `trightZero + rightZero`, and `rightOne` must satisfy the condition `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Since `left` was initially `mid - 1`, decrementing `leftOne` by 1 does not directly affect `left` but changes the value of `leftOne`. The value of `leftZero` remains unchanged, and `rightOne` still needs to satisfy the same condition as before because no operations directly affect it.
