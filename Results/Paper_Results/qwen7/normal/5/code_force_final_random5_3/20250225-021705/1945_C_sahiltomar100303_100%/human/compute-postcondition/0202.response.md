Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `mid`, `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightOne` is 1, the character at index `i` in `s` is not '0'**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is now irrelevant since it was incremented). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
