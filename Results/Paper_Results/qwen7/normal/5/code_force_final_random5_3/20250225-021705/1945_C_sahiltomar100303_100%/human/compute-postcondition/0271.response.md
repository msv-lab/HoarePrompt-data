Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 2, `tleftZero` is increased by 1 if `s[right-1]` was '0', otherwise it is decreased by 1; `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right-1]` was '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `trightOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[right-1]` was not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right-1]` was not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `right` has been incremented by 1, making it an index within the string `s` plus 2. The values of `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` have been updated based on the condition of whether `s[right-1]` is '0' or not.
