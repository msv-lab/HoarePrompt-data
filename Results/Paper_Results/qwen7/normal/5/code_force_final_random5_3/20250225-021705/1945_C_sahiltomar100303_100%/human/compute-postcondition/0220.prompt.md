Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value, `trightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is between 0 and mid inclusive, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is between 0 and mid inclusive, `right` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is `mid`, `s` is the input string, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is between 0 and mid inclusive, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (from `i = 0` to `i = mid - 1`), the variable `i` will be equal to `mid`. The loop increments `leftZero` and `tleftZero` for each '0' encountered in the string `s`, and increments `leftOne` and `tleftOne` for each '1'. Therefore, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` will be the counts of '0's and '1's in the first half of the string, respectively. The values of `trightOne`, `trightZero`, `right`, `n`, `t`, `mid`, `s`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, and `trightZero` will remain as they were initialized or updated within the loop body, but `i` will be `mid` after the loop completes. The value of `total` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is `mid`, `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', `rightZero` is 2. Otherwise, `rightOne` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is `mid + 1`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2. Otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is `mid + 2`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
