Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `mid` to `n-1`. The loop condition is that `i` should be less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `mid`.
   - `n` must be greater than `mid`.

4. **Loop Body Effects**:
   - If the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1.
   - If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0', then `rightOne` is increased by 1.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `mid + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `mid + 1` must be less than `n`.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be `mid + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `mid + 1`.

7. **Consider the Effects on `rightZero` and `rightOne`**:
   - These variables are updated based on the character at index `i` in `s`, but they do not affect the loop condition directly. Therefore, their values do not need to be explicitly mentioned in the state update.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`**
