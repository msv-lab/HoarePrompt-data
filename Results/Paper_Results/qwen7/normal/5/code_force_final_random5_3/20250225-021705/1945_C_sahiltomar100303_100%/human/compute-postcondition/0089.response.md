Output State: `i` is `0`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus a value between 0 and 3, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` and has been incremented by 1 if `s[left - 1] == '0'` for each iteration, `left` is `mid - k` where `k` is the number of iterations (which is equal to `n - 1`), `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - (n - 1)` which means it will be `leftZero - (n - 1)` and is less than `mid // 2`.

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `i` starts at `n - 1` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `0`. The `left` variable starts at `mid` and decreases by 1 with each iteration, ending at `mid - (n - 1)`. The `leftZero` variable decreases by 1 for each iteration, resulting in a total decrease of `n - 1`. The conditions on `rightZero` and `rightOne` depend on the characters being processed during each iteration, but they will adjust according to the loop's criteria.
