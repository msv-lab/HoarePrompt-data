Output State: **`tleftZero` retains its original properties, `t` retains its original properties, `n` retains its original properties, `s` retains its original properties, `mid` retains its original properties, `rightZero` retains its original properties, `trightOne` retains its original properties, `leftOne` is increased by 1, `i` is `i_current + 1`.**

This means that the variables `tleftZero`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `rightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `leftOne` is incremented by 1, and `i` is updated to `i_current + 1`.
