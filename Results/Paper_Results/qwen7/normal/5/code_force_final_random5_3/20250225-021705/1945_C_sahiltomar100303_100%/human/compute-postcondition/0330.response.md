Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0.**

The code simply initializes `tleftOne` to 0. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
