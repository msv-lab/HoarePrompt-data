Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `mid` to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at `mid` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently `mid`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `mid + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to `i`, which is now `mid + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `mid + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to `mid + 1`.

Given these steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid + 1`**.
