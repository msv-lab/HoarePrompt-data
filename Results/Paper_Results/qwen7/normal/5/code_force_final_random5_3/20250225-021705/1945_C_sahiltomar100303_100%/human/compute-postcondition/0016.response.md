Output State: **`tleftZero` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `rightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'**.

The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Initially, `tleftZero` was 1, so after executing the code, `tleftZero` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
