Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n // 2` to the variable `mid`. This means `mid` is the integer division of `n` by 2. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
