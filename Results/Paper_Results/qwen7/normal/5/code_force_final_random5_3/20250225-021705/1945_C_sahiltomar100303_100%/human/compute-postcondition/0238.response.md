Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be at least 2, `leftZero` must be less than (left + 1) // 2, and `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, `i` was `n-1`. After decrementing `leftOne`, `i` becomes `n-2`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
