Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be at least 2, `leftZero` must be less than (left + 1) // 2, `rightOne` is less than (n - left + 1) // 2 + 1**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `rightOne` was originally less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`. After incrementing, `rightOne` is now less than `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
