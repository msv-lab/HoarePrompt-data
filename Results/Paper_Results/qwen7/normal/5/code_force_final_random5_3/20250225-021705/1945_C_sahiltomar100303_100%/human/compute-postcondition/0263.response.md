Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 1, `tleftZero` is increased by 1 if the character at index `right-1` in string `s` was '0', otherwise `tleftOne` is increased by 1; `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if the character at index `right-1` in string `s` was '0', otherwise `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

This means that the `right` index has been incremented by 1, and the values of `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` have been updated based on the character at the previous index (`right-1`) in the string `s`.
