Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 3, `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `tleftOne` remains unchanged, `trightZero` remains unchanged, `trightOne` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
