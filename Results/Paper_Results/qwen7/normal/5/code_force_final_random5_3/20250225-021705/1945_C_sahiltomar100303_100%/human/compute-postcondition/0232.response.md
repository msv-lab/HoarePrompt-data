Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `leftZero` and `rightZero` adjust according to the value of `s[left - 1]`. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` decreases by 1 and `rightZero` increases by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` increases by 1 and `leftOne` decreases by 1. `leftZero` must still be less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, and `rightOne` must also be less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`.
