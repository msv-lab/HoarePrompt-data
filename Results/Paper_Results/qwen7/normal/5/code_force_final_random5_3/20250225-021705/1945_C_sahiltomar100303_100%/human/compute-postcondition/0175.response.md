Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value, `trightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, `right` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `mid` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the input string, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, and `s[i]` is not equal to '0'**.

Explanation: The line `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially 0, it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously mentioned states.
