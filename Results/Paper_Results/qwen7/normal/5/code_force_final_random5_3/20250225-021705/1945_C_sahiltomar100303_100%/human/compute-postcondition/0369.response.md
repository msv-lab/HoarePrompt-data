Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The line `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` was already increased by 1 before this line, it is now increased by 2 in total. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
