Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s`, and the character at index `right` in string `s` is not '0'; `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Since the initial state of `tleftOne` is not specified, we only know that it has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
