Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `right` is set to `n`, meaning it is the maximum index.
   - `left` is set to `0`.
   - The condition `tleftZero < (n + 1) // 2` does not hold, which means `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

2. **Condition for `right`:**
   - The condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` must still hold for `right` to be the maximum index.
   - Since `right` is `n`, let's check the condition with `right = n`:
     - `trightOne < (n - n + 1) // 2` simplifies to `trightOne < 1 // 2`, which is `trightOne < 0.5`.
     - For this condition to hold, `trightOne` must be less than `0.5`. Since `trightOne` is a count of '1's, it must be `0` (as counts are integers).

3. **Determine `right`:**
   - Given `right = n` and `trightOne = 0`, the condition `(trightOne < 0.5)` holds true.
   - Therefore, `right` is indeed the maximum index satisfying the condition.

4. **Value of `left`:**
   - The value of `left` is explicitly stated to be `0`.

5. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement is `print(left)`.
   - Since `left` is `0`, the print statement will output `0`.

Output: **0**
