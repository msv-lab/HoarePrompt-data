Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `mid + 1`, `rightZero` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or another number). Since it is incremented by 1, its new value is 1. The values of `total` and `i` remain unchanged.
