Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n-4`, `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is `1`, and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`.**

The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Given that `rightZero` was initially less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, after incrementing, its new value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
