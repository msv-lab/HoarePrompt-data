Output State: **`right` remains `mid`; - `n` remains unchanged; - `tleftZero` is increased by 1; - `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`; - The value of `s[right]` is '0'.**

The variable `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The condition for `trightOne` still holds as it is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`.
