Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `rightOne`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
