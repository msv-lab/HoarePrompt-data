Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states. The condition for `rightOne` remains the same, and the value of `s[left - 1]` also stays as '0'.
