Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` (it either increases by 1 or stays the same), `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` (it either stays the same or increases by 1), `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` (if `s[left - 1] == '0'`), and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1` (if `s[left - 1] != '0'`).
