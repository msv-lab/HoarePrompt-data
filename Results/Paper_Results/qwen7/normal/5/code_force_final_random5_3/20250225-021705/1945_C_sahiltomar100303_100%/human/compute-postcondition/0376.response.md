Output State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid + 2`, `rightOne` is increased by 1 (now `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`).**

Explanation: The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `rightOne`.
