Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `mid`, `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is 1, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was not defined before, it is initialized to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
