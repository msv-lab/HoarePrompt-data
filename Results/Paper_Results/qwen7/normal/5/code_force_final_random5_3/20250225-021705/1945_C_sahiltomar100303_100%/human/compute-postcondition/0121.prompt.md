Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `0`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus a value between 0 and 3, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` and has been incremented by up to 3 if `s[left - 1] == '0'`, `left` is `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 3` and is less than `mid // 2`, `right` is `mid`
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1 (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 1 less than its previous value if `s[right]` is '0', and `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', `right` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1 (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[right]` is '0' and 0 if `s[right]` is '1', `trightZero` is 1 less than its previous value, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', `right` is increased by 1, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must hold true.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1 (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[right]` is '0' and 1 if `s[right]` is '1', `trightZero` is 0 less than its previous value, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', `right` is increased by 1, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must hold true.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
