Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `rightOne`.
