Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is `0`, and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
