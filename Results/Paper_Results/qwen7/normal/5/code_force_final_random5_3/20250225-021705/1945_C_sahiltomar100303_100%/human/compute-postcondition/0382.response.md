Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` is equal to `trightZero + rightZero`, and `rightOne` is equal to `trightOne + rightOne`.**

Explanation: The line `leftMove = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `leftMove`. This does not affect the values of `left`, `mid`, `i`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne`, which remain as specified in the initial state. Therefore, these variables retain their respective values from the initial state.
