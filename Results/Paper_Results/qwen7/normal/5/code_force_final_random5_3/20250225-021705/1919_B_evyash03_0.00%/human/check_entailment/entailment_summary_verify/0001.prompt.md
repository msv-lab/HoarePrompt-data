You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    parts = expression.split('-')
    result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))
    print(func_1(expression, result_length))

def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
    return count + (balance > 0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` consisting of '+' and '-' characters and an integer `length`. It counts the number of iterations the loop runs until the balance (difference between the number of '+' and '-') is greater than 0. If the balance becomes greater than 0, it returns the count plus 1; otherwise, it returns the count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty for a segment of the array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `expression`.
   - It splits the string `expression` at each `'-'` character, which means it considers segments between `'-'` characters as separate parts.
   - It then calls `func_1(expression, result_length)` with the `result_length` being the sum of lengths of these parts.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of segments that need to be considered for the penalty calculation. It does this by iterating through the string and counting changes in the balance (from positive to negative), which indicates the start of a new segment.
3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `count` is initialized to 0.
   - `balance` is initialized to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string:
     - If the character is `'+'`, it increments the `balance`.
     - If the character is `'-'`, it decrements the `balance`.
     - If the `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` and resets `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns `count` plus 1 if `balance` is greater than 0, indicating an incomplete segment at the end.
4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the number of segments needed to split the array to minimize the penalty.
   - However, the function does not actually compute the penalty; it only counts the number of segments.
   - The main function does not handle the actual penalty calculation based on the segments identified.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution because it only counts the number of segments but does not calculate the actual penalty as per the problem statement.
