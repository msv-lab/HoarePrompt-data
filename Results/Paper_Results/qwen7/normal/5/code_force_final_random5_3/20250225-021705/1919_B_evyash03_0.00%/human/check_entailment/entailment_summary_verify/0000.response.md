Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` in detail.

1. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - The string `s` is split into parts based on the '-' character, and the length of these parts is summed up.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `expression` and the sum of lengths of these parts as arguments.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `expression` and an integer `length`.
   - It initializes `count` to 0 and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `expression`:
     - If the character is '+', it increments the `balance` by 1.
     - If the character is '-', it decrements the `balance` by 1.
     - If the `balance` becomes less than 0, it increments the `count` by 1 and resets the `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

3. **Behavior and Correctness**:
   - The function `func_1` essentially counts the number of times the balance goes negative during the iteration through the string.
   - This count represents the number of times the sum of elements in a subarray becomes negative, which indirectly helps in splitting the array to minimize the penalty.
   - The returned value `count + (balance > 0)` ensures that even if the balance is positive at the end, it still adds 1 to the count, indicating an additional split needed to ensure the sum of elements in each subarray is non-negative.

Given the problem description, the goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays. The provided program seems to follow a logical approach to achieve this by counting the number of necessary splits based on the balance of '+' and '-' characters.

The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty, but upon closer inspection, the function `func_1` appears to be designed to count the necessary splits to ensure the minimum penalty. The logic of counting the splits where the balance goes negative and ensuring the final balance is positive aligns with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate, and the program is indeed correct based on the given problem description and the function summary.

Final: **True**
