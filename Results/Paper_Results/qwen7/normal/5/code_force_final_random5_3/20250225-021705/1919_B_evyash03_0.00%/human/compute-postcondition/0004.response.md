Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string, the first character of `expression` is '+', and `balance` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. Since `balance` was initially 0 (implied by the initial state where no specific value was given but the first character of `expression` being '+' and `char` being '+'), after executing the code, `balance` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so `expression` and `char` retain their initial states.
