Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` consisting of '+' and '-' characters and an integer `length`. It counts the number of iterations the loop runs until the balance (difference between the number of '+' and '-') is greater than 0. If the balance becomes greater than 0, it returns the count plus 1; otherwise, it returns the count.**
