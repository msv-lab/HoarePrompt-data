Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. Specifically, the program attempts to split the string into parts separated by '-' and counts the number of such splits, which does not align with the actual requirement of minimizing the penalty based on the sum of elements in each subarray.

For instance, consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The correct approach would be to split the string into `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` and then group consecutive '+' and '-' to minimize the penalty. However, the current implementation simply counts the number of '-' characters, which does not reflect the true minimum penalty calculation.

A correct solution would involve dynamic programming or a greedy approach to minimize the penalty by considering the sum of elements in each potential subarray and choosing the optimal splits.
