Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for char in expression:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `char` and `expression`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the `expression` string.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `expression` is a non-empty string.
   - `balance` is 0.
   - `count` is increased by 1 (implying it is now 1).

4. **Adjust the State for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `count` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, and it was 0 before the first iteration, after the first iteration, `count` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `expression` must still contain at least one character. If `expression` had only one character initially, it would now be an empty string, and the loop would terminate.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `expression` still contains at least one character for the loop to continue. Therefore, `expression` must be a non-empty string, and `count` must be 1.

**Final State**:
- `expression` is a non-empty string.
- `balance` remains 0.
- `count` is 1.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string, `balance` is 0, and `count` is 1**.
