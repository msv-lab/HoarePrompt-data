Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `i` stays at 0. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` as an input integer, while `t` and `i` retain their initial values.
