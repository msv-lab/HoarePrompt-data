Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `q` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes a dictionary `q` with a list comprehension that creates a list of length `n + 1`, where each element in the list is set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `w`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
