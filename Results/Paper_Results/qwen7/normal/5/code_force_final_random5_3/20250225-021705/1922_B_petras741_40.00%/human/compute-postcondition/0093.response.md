Output State: **All elements in `q` are either 0 or greater than 0, depending on their presence and count in `w`. The list `eta` contains all unique integers from `w` that have a count greater than 0 in `q`, with each integer appearing once for each time it was found in `w`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (from `j = 0` to `j = n`), `q` will have been checked and incremented for each integer present in `w`. For each integer `j` in `w`, `q[j]` will be incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `j` in `w`. Therefore, `q[j]` will be greater than 0 for all integers `j` that appear in `w`, and 0 for all other indices. The list `eta` will contain each unique integer from `w` that has a non-zero value in `q`, with each integer appearing in `eta` as many times as it appears in `w`.
