Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `w` by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and `n` remains an input integer. The newly created list `w` contains the integers obtained from the split operation.
