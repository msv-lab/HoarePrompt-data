Output State: **`j` is greater than 1001, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1001, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1)`.**

Explanation: The variable `rho` is incremented by the value of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1)`. The values of `j` and `eta_ln` remain unchanged from their initial states. The exact value of `rho` depends on the value of `q[eta[j]]`, but it is clear that `rho` has been updated accordingly.
