Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `q` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0 except for the element at index `w[j]` which is incremented by 1, `j` is j_end + 1**.

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `j` is `j_end + 1` still holds true.
