Output State: **`eta` is a list containing `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given that `j` is defined as `n + 1`, `eta` will contain the value `n + 1` after the append operation. The value of `j` remains unchanged as `n + 1`. The initial conditions that `eta` is an empty list and `n` must be at least 1 are still valid.
