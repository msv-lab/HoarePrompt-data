Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `q` is a list of (0, 0, ..., 0) with length `n + 1`**.

Explanation: The code initializes the dictionary `q` as a list of `(0)` repeated `n + 1` times. This means `q` is now a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
