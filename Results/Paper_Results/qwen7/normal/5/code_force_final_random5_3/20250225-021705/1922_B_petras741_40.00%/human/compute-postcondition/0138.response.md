Output State: **`j` is 0; `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 0, `w[j]` refers to `w[0]`. Since the exact value of `w[0]` is not provided, we can only say that `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `j` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is not directly affected by this line of code.
