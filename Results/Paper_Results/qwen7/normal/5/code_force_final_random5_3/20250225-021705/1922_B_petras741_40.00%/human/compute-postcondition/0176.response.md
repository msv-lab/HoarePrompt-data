Output State: **`j` is greater than 1001, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1001, `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the value of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to its current value. Since `j` and `eta_ln` are both greater than 1001, their values remain unchanged. The updated value of `res` depends on the value of `q[eta[j]]`, which is not specified, but it is clear that `res` has been incremented by the given expression.
