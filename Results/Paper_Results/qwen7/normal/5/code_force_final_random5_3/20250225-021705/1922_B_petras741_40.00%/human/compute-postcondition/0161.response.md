Output State: **`eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `rho` is equal to the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `q` at the index specified by `eta[0]` to the variable `rho`. The other variables (`eta_ln`, `j`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
