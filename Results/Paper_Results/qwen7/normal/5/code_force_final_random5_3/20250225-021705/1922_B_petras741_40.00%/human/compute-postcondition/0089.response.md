Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `q` is a list of integers.
   - `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` from the previous iteration and the new value of `j`.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - If `q[j]` is greater than 0, the condition holds as is. If `q[j]` is not greater than 0, the condition still holds with `j` incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the New Value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - `eta` will include the new value of `j` (which is `j + 1`).

Given that `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration as `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

Since the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`, we need to ensure that `j` does not exceed `n`.

6. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `j` will be `k + 1`.
   - `eta` will include the new value of `j` (which is `k + 1`).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`q` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` from the previous iteration and the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

If `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be `k + 1`.
- `eta` will include the new value of `j` (which is `k + 1`).

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`q` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` from the previous iteration and the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
