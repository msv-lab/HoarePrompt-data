Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `w` remains the same**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1 and becomes an input integer, and `w` remains unchanged.
