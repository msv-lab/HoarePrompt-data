Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n-1`, and each element in the list `q` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the corresponding index in the list `w`.**

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `j` will have the value `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. Each element in the list `q` will be incremented by 1 for every time its index appears in the list `w`. This means if an index `k` appears `m` times in `w`, then `q[k]` will be `m`.
