Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n + 1`, `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, and `res` accumulates the contributions from each iteration of the loop, where each contribution is the sum of two terms: `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `rho` accumulates the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for each `j` from 1 to 1000. If `n` is less than 3, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `w` retain their original values.**
