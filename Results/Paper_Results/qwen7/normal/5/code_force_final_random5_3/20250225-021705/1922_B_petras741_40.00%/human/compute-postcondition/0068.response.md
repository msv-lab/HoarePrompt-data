Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `w`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` is an input integer as stated in the initial state.
