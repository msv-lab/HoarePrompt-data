Postcondition: `q` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` from the previous iteration and the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, the condition holds as is. If `q[j]` is not greater than 0, the condition still holds with `j` incremented by 1.
