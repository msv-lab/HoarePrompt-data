Output State: **`rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]]`, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `res` is the result of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * (`q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]]`)`, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `rho` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]]` to its current value, which was originally `q[eta[0]]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
