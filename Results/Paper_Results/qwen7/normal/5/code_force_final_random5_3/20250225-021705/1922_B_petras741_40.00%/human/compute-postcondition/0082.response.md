Output State: **`q[j]` is greater than 0, `q` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`, and all other variables retain their values from the precondition.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `q[j]` is greater than 0 and `q` is a list of integers, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `eta` now contains the value `j`.
