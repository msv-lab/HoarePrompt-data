Reasoning:
The provided program (function `func`) is designed to process multiple input strings `a` and check the count of '1's within each string. It then prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. However, the given problem description and the code snippet provided do not match. The problem description talks about generating files for HTML files in a specified directory range, whereas the code snippet provided is a completely different function that processes strings and prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

Given the mismatch between the problem description and the code snippet, the program (function `func`) does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
