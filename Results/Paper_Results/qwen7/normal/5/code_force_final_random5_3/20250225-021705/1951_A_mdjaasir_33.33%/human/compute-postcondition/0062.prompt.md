Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a.index('1') and a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string. The number of occurrences of '1' in the string `a` is either 0 or greater than 0. If the count of '1's in the string `a` is greater than 2 and even, then the count remains unchanged. Otherwise, the count of '1's in the string `a` is either exactly 2 and even under specific conditions (index of the first '1' exists and the character immediately following it is not '1', or the index of the first '1' does not exist or the character immediately following it is '1'), or the count is greater than 2 or even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If `count` is 0, the condition remains unchanged. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the condition remains unchanged. If `count` is not greater than 2 or not even, the condition also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, and `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If `count` is 0, the value of `count` remains unchanged. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, `count` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
