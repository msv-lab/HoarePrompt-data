Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes t test cases, where each test case consists of four lines of input representing the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns nothing explicitly but processes each test case to validate the coordinates and ensure they form a valid square.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving the coordinates of a square's corners. The function does not return any value directly but performs validation on the input coordinates to confirm they correctly define a square.
