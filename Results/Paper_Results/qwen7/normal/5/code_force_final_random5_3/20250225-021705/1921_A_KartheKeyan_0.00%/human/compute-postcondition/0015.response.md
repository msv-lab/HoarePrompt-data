Output State: `n` is 0, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[ (0, 0), (1, input integer), (x, y), (x, y) ]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations (4 times), `n` remains 0 because it was never modified inside the loop. The `coord` list will contain four tuples as each iteration adds a new tuple from user input. The variable `res` stays at 0 since no operation modifying `res` was performed within the loop. The variable `i` will be 2 after the last iteration of the loop, as the loop runs from `i` in `range(4)`.
