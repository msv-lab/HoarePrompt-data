Output State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning `x` to the first integer and `y` to the second integer. The values of `n`, `coord`, `res`, and the initial value of `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` remains 0, `coord` remains an empty list, `res` remains 0, and `x` and `y` are set to the input integers.
