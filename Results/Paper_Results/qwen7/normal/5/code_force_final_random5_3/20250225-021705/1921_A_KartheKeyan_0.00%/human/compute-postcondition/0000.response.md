Output State: **`n` is decreased by 1 after each iteration of the while loop, `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for each value of `l`, and `l` is an input integer for each iteration of the while loop.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l`, calculates `s` using the formula `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`, and prints the value of `s`. After processing each test case, `n` is decremented by 1. The values of `x_i` and `y_i` from the initial state are not used in the code and remain unchanged.
