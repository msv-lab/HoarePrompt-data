Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer; `coord` is a list containing one tuple (`x`, `y`).**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. It does not affect the value of `i` or the list `coord`. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers, and `coord` contains the tuple `(x, y)`.
