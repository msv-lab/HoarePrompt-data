Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, input integer), (input integer, input integer), (input integer, input integer), (input integer, input integer); `p1` is the sum of squared differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the first two points in `coord`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the Euclidean distance squared between the first two points in the `coord` list. The first point is (1, input integer) and the second point is (input integer, input integer). So, `p1` is calculated as `(input integer - 1) ** 2 + (input integer - input integer) ** 2`. However, since the second y-coordinate is the same as the first y-coordinate, the term `(input integer - input integer) ** 2` equals 0. Therefore, `p1` simplifies to `(input integer - 1) ** 2`. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `coord` remain unchanged.
