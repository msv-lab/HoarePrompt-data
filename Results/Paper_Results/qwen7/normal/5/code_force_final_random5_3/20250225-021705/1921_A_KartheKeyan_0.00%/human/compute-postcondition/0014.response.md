Output State: `n` is 0, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[ (0, 0), (1, input integer), (x, y), (x, y) ]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations (4 times in total), the variable `n` remains 0 as it was not modified within the loop. The list `coord` will contain four tuples representing the coordinates entered by the user. The variable `res` remains 0 since no operation was performed on it inside the loop. The variable `i` will be 2 because the loop runs from `0` to `3`, so after the last iteration, `i` equals `3 - 1`.
