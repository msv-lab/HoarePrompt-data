You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is equal to t-1, `s` is the last input string provided, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, and `b` is the second integer from the split string `s`. The loop has printed 'Bob' for every pair `(a, b)` where `(a + b) % 2 == 0` and 'Alice' otherwise.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing one coin from their wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., a move that results in a non-zero coin count) loses.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Analyzing the Outcome Based on Coin Counts:**
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob will win because:
     - Alice starts with an odd number of moves (since `a + b` is even, the first player will always be able to make the last move if the total is even).
     - Bob can mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he always has a move when it's his turn.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice will win because:
     - Alice starts with an even number of moves.
     - Alice can ensure she makes the last move by always swapping wallets when it's her turn, forcing Bob into a position where he cannot make a valid move.

3. **Evaluating the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it splits the input string to get the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints the corresponding winner.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in the code correctly identifies whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - Based on the parity of the sum, it correctly determines the winner according to the game rules.
   - The code handles multiple test cases as required.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the code is correct.
