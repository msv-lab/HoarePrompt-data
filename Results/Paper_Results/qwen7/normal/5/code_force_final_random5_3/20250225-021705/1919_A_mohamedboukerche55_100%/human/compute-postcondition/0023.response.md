Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is \(i + 2\), `s` is the input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the split string `s`.**

Explanation: The code splits the string `s` into a list using `split()` and then converts the second element of the resulting list to an integer, assigning it to `b`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 2, `s` remains the original input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, and now `b` is the integer value of the second element from the split string `s`.
