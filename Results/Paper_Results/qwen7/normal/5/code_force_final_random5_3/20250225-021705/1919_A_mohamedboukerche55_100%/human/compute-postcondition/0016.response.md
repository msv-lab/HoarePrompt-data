Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is \(i + 1\), `s` is an updated input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string `s`.**

Explanation: The code splits the string `s` into a list using `split()` and then converts the second element of the list (which is the second part of the split string) into an integer and assigns it to `b`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and `s` is updated to the new input string. The value of `a` remains the first integer from the original split string, and `b` now holds the second integer from the split string.
