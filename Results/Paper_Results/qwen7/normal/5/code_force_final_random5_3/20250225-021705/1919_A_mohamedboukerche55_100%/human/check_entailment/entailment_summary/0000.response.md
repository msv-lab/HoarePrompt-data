Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking whether the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. However, the logic used to determine the winner is incorrect. According to the problem statement, the key factor in determining the winner is whether the total number of coins (a + b) is even or odd, but the actual game mechanics need to be considered.

According to the game rules:
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, the first player (Alice) will lose if both players play optimally because she will always end up in a position where she cannot make a valid move.
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, the first player (Alice) will win because she can always force the game into a state where the second player (Bob) cannot make a valid move.

The provided program incorrectly checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even and prints 'Bob' in that case, which is the opposite of what the correct logic should be. It should print 'Bob' when the sum is odd and 'Alice' when the sum is even.

Given this analysis, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
