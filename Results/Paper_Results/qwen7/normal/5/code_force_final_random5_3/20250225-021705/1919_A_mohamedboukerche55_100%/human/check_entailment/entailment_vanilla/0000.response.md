### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing one coin from their wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., a move that results in a non-zero coin count) loses.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Analyzing the Outcome Based on Coin Counts:**
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob will win because:
     - Alice starts with an odd number of moves (since `a + b` is even, the first player will always be able to make the last move if the total is even).
     - Bob can mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he always has a move when it's his turn.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice will win because:
     - Alice starts with an even number of moves.
     - Alice can ensure she makes the last move by always swapping wallets when it's her turn, forcing Bob into a position where he cannot make a valid move.

3. **Evaluating the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it splits the input string to get the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints the corresponding winner.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in the code correctly identifies whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - Based on the parity of the sum, it correctly determines the winner according to the game rules.
   - The code handles multiple test cases as required.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the code is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
