Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes values for t, a, and b where t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^9. The function returns information based on the values of a and b for each test case.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters when called, instead it seems to handle multiple test cases internally, each defined by values of `a` and `b` within specified ranges, and processes these values to produce some output for each test case.
