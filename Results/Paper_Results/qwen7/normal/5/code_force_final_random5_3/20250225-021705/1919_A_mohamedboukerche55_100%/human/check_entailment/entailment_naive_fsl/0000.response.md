Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. According to the problem description, the game is won by the player who cannot make a valid move, and both players play optimally. The program incorrectly determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in both wallets being even or odd.

For example, consider the test case `1 1`:
- According to the problem description, Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob also starts with 1 coin.
- Alice can choose not to swap wallets and remove 1 coin, leaving her with 0 coins.
- Bob, now with 1 coin, can choose to swap wallets, but since Alice has no coins, he cannot remove a coin from an empty wallet and thus loses.
- Therefore, Bob should win, but the program incorrectly prints "Bob".

Another example is the test case `1 4`:
- Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with 4 coins.
- Alice can choose not to swap wallets and remove 1 coin, leaving her with 0 coins.
- Bob, now with 4 coins, can choose not to swap wallets and remove 1 coin, leaving him with 3 coins.
- Alice, now with 0 coins, cannot make a valid move and thus loses.
- Therefore, Bob should win, but the program incorrectly prints "Alice".

These examples demonstrate that the program does not correctly implement the game logic, hence the correctness is **False**.
