### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing one coin from their wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., a move that results in a non-zero coin count) loses.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Analyzing the Outcome Based on Coin Counts:**
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob will win because:
     - Alice starts with an odd number of moves (since `a + b` is even, the first player will always be able to make the last move if the total is even).
     - Bob can mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he always has a move when it's his turn.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice will win because:
     - Alice starts with an even number of moves.
     - Alice can ensure she makes the last move by always swapping wallets when it's her turn, forcing Bob into a position where he cannot make a valid move.

3. **Evaluating the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it splits the input string to get the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints the corresponding winner.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in the code correctly identifies whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - However, the implementation of the game logic in the code is flawed. The code simply checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints the corresponding winner without considering the actual game dynamics. Specifically, the code does not simulate the game moves and does not account for the fact that the players can swap wallets.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 1`
  - According to the game rules, Alice will lose because she cannot make a valid move after Bob removes one coin from his wallet.
  - However, the code incorrectly prints "Bob".

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `1 4`
  - According to the game rules, Alice will win because she can force Bob into a position where he cannot make a valid move.
  - However, the code incorrectly prints "Alice".

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the game logic. It simply checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` and prints the corresponding winner without simulating the actual game moves. This leads to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not accurately simulate the game dynamics and determine the winner based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
