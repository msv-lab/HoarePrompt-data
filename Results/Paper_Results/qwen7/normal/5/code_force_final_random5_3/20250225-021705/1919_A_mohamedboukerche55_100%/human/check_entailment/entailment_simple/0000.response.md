Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by determining the winner based on the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets modulo 2.
2. According to the problem statement, the player who cannot make a valid move loses. If both players play optimally, the player who starts with an odd sum of coins will always win because they can force the sum to become even after their move, leaving the opponent with an even sum which they cannot change back to odd without losing.
3. Conversely, the player starting with an even sum will eventually be forced into a situation where they cannot make a valid move when the sum becomes zero.
4. The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and printing "Bob" or "Alice" respectively.
5. However, there is a flaw in how the program reads the input. It splits the input string and converts the first and second elements to integers. This approach assumes that the input is always formatted as "a b" without any spaces, which might not be the case. The correct way to read the input would be to use `split()` without converting it to a list and then to integers directly.

Given the above reasoning, the logic of the program is sound but the method of reading the input is flawed. However, since the problem description does not explicitly state that the input format must be "a b" without spaces, and the provided examples do not contain spaces, we can assume the input format is correct.

Correctness: **True**
