Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    a = int(list(s.split())[0])
    b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is an input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string `s`. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd depending on the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is \(i + 1\), `s` is an updated input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string `s`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged regardless of the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is \(i + 2\), `s` is the input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the split string `s`. The postcondition does not change regardless of whether `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is true or false, as both the if and else parts do not modify these variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
