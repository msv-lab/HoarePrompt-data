Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. According to the problem statement, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time is determined by the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period of \(m+1\) minutes.

The program correctly calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period using the formula:
\[ \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2 \]

Here's a breakdown of why this formula works:
- \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor\) gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period.
- \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor\) gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period.
- Adding 2 accounts for the fact that fireworks launched exactly at the start and end of the visibility period (at 0 and \(m\)) will be counted twice.

The program processes each test case correctly and prints the result for each test case. Given the logic and the implementation, the program should work as intended for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
