State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, qi is 0** 

Explanation:
- The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- The variable `qi` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. It will increment with each iteration but does not affect the condition for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is valid and `qi` is set to its initial value before the loop starts.
