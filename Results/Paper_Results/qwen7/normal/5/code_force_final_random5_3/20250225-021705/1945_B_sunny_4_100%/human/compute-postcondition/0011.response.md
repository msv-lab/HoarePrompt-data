Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `qi` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`, `a` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer, `m` is updated to an input integer**.

Explanation: The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The values of `t`, `qi`, `ans`, and the original values of `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged, but the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are now updated to the input values.
