### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky. Each installation launches fireworks at regular intervals, and each firework remains visible for \(m + 1\) minutes after launch. The key is to determine the number of fireworks from both installations that are visible at the same time.

#### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation separately and then sums these values plus 2 (to account for the possibility of simultaneous launches):

```python
t = int(input())
for qi in range(t):
    a, b, m = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    ans = m // a + m // b + 2
    print(ans)
```

#### Correctness of the Formula
The formula `ans = m // a + m // b + 2` is indeed incorrect. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Assumption**: The formula assumes that each installation will launch fireworks at the exact moment they become visible, which is not necessarily true. The formula does not account for the overlap of launch times between the two installations.

2. **Overlap Consideration**: The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\), and then determining how many fireworks from each installation are visible at those LCM times. Additionally, we need to count the fireworks that are visible immediately before and after these LCM times.

#### Example Analysis
Let's revisit the example provided in the original assessment:

- **Input**: `a = 6`, `b = 7`, `m = 4`
- **Expected Output**: `2`

Using the provided formula:
- `A = m // a + 1 = 4 // 6 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `B = m // b + 1 = 4 // 7 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `ans = A + B = 1 + 1 = 2`

This seems correct because the first installation launches at 6, 12, 18, etc., and the second installation launches at 7, 14, 21, etc. The only time both installations launch fireworks simultaneously is at 42 (LCM of 6 and 7), making it possible to see 2 fireworks at the same time.

However, the provided formula does not account for the possibility of overlapping launches at other times, such as when one installation launches just before the other.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Find the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\).
2. Determine the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible at the LCM times.
3. Count the fireworks that are visible immediately before and after these LCM times.

The correct formula would involve more complex logic to handle the overlaps and simultaneous launches.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen simultaneously. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
