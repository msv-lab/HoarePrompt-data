Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input, `y4` is the second integer from the input, and `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns it to `res`. Since `y1` is less than `y2`, `res` will be `y2 - y1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
