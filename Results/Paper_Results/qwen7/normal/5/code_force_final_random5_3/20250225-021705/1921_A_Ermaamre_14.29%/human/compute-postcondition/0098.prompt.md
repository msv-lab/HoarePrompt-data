You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. Each testcase is described over four lines, where each line contains two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. There are t such testcases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and it is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
            if y1 < y3:
                res = abs(y3 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y3)
        elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        
        print(res ** 2)
        
    #State: a is an input integer, i is equal to a-1 (since the loop runs from 0 to a-1), x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, and y4 are input integers from the last iteration of the loop, and res is the absolute difference between y3 and y1 if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4 hold true, otherwise res is the absolute difference between y2 and y1 if x1 == x2 and x3 == x4 or x1 == x4 and x3 == x2 holds true, and res remains unchanged in other cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no input parameters and returns the coordinates of the vertices of a square defined by given points with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
