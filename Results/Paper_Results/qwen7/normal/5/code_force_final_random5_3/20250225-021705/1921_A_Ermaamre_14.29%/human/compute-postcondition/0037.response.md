Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input, `y4` is the second integer from the input, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, and `(x1 == x4 and x3 == x2)`, and `y1 >= y2`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `res`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `(x1 == x4 and x3 == x2)` and `y1 >= y2` are preserved.
