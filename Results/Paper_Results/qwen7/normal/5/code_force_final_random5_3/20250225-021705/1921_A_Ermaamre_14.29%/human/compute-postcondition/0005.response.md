Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input, `y4` is the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers. These integers are then assigned to `x4` and `y4`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`) remain unchanged.
