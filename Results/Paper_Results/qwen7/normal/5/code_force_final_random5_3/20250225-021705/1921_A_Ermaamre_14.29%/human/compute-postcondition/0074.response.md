Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers from the second input, `x3` and `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are input integers, `res` remains unchanged**

The code `x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x3` and `y3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
