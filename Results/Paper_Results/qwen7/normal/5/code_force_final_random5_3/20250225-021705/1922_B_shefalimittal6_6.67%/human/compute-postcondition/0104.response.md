Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one value, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the value of `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary except for the value of `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
