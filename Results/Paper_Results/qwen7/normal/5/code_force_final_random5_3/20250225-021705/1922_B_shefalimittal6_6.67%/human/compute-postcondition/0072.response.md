Output State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`; if `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged; `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`; `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. The value of `total_sum` remains the same as before, which is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`. The value of `num_of_lens` and whether `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3 remains unchanged. The updated value of `res` now includes the additional contribution from `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.
