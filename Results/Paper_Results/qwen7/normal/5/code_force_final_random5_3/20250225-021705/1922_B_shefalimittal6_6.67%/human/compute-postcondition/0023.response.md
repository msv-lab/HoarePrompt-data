Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is not an empty dictionary, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` or `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, and the value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`.
