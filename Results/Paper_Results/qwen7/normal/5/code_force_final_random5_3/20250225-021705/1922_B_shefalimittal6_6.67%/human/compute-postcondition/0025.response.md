Output State: **`res` is the original value of `res` plus the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`**.

In this state, the variable `res` has been updated to include the result of adding the combination of `cnt` choose 3 (denoted as `math.comb(cnt, 3)`) to its original value. The variable `cnt` remains unchanged from its previous state, and the mathematical function `math.comb(cnt, 3)` has been evaluated and added to `res`.
