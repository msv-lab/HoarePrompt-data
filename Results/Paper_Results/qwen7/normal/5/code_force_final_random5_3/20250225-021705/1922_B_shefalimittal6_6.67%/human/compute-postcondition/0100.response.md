Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one value, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list, and the count (`cnt`) is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code increments `res` by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Since `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `math.comb(cnt, 3)` is a specific value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
