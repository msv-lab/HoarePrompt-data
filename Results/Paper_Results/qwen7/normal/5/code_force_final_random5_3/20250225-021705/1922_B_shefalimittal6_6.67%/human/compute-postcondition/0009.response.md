Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `next_x` and value 2.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `nums`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `nums` must have at least 1 element.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least 2 elements because one element is processed in each iteration.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `num_of_lens` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `nums` must now have at least 2 elements.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `next_x` and value 2, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements.**

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `next_x` and value 2, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements**
