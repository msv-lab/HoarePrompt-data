Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair.
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.
- If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens` using `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`.

### Analysis
- The loop variable `cnt` is derived from the values in `num_of_lens`.
- The loop variable `res` is modified based on the value of `cnt`.

### States to Adjust
- Since `num_of_lens` is the dictionary being iterated over, its structure (number of key-value pairs) does not change within the loop. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `num_of_lens`.
- The variable `res` might change depending on the value of `cnt`. We need to consider both cases: when `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 and when `cnt` is less than 2.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Initial State**: `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated.
   - If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.

Since the loop will continue as long as there are more values in `num_of_lens` to iterate over, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `res`.

### New State
- `num_of_lens` must still have at least one key-value pair.
- `res` will either remain unchanged or be updated based on the current value of `cnt`.

Given that the loop will continue as long as there are more values in `num_of_lens`, the new state should reflect that `num_of_lens` still has at least one key-value pair and `res` is updated according to the current value of `cnt`.

### Final Answer
State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; if `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.**
