Output State: **`res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` is updated to the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` is the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the current value of `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the current value of `cnt`. This sum is stored in `total_sum`. The conditions for updating `res` and `cnt` remain unchanged. The value of `num_of_lens` itself does not change. The next value of `cnt` in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()` is used after this operation.
