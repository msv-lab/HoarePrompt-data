Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `nums`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key `x` and value 1.
   - `res` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `x` is the first element of `nums`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `x` is the first element of `nums`, after the first iteration, `x` will be set to the second element of `nums`.
   - The list `nums` will still have at least one element (since it had at least one element initially).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `num_of_lens` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `res` remains 0 as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `x` will now be the second element of `nums`.
   - `nums` must still have at least one element.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key `x` and value 1, `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the second element of `nums`**
