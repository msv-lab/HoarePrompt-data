Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`. The key variable here is `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are values in `num_of_lens` that satisfy the condition `cnt >= 3`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one value.
   - `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.
   - `t` is 0 or negative.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is an empty list.
   - `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the values in `num_of_lens`, the next `cnt` value should be the next available value in `num_of_lens.values()` that satisfies the condition `cnt >= 3`.
   - If the current `cnt` was used in the previous iteration and it was greater than or equal to 3, then `res` would have been updated. Therefore, for the next iteration, `cnt` should be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` that meets the condition.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `num_of_lens` still contains at least one value.
- `res` remains the same unless the new `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, in which case `res` would be updated.
- `t` remains 0 or negative.
- `n` remains the same input integer.
- `nums` remains an empty list.
- `cnt` becomes the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` that satisfies `cnt >= 3`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `cnt` from the previous iteration, we can only say that `cnt` will be the next valid value from `num_of_lens.values()`.

**Final State**:
State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one value, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` that satisfies `cnt >= 3`**.
