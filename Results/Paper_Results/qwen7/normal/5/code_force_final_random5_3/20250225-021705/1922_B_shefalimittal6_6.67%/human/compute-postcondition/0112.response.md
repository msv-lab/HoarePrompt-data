Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one value, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding `cnt`, and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`**.

Explanation:
- The code calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`. This means `total_sum` is updated based on the current values in `num_of_lens`.
- The value of `res` remains unchanged unless `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, in which case `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, and `cnt`) remain in their original states.
