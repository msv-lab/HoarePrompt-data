Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
2. A triangle can be formed if and only if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.
3. Given the nature of the stick lengths (powers of 2), directly checking the triangle inequality condition would be complex.
4. The provided solution instead uses combinatorial methods to count the valid combinations:
   - It counts how many times each stick length appears.
   - For each unique stick length that appears 3 or more times, it adds the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of that length.
   - For each unique stick length that appears 2 or more times, it adds the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of that length and multiplies by the sum of the frequencies of all other stick lengths.
5. This approach leverages the fact that if there are at least three sticks of the same length, any combination of three of those sticks will form a degenerate triangle (a straight line), which is not allowed. Therefore, the method focuses on combinations involving different stick lengths.
6. The solution correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution appears to be correct and follows the logic required to solve the problem.
