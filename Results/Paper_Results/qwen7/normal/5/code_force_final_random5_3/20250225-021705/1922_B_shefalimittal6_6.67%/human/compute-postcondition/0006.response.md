Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` and value 1 more than the previous count of `x`, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by incrementing the count of the key `x` by 1. Since `x` is not specified in the initial state, it is assumed to be one of the elements in the list `nums`. The value of `t` and `n` remains unchanged, and the structure of `num_of_lens` and `nums` is preserved, with `num_of_lens` now containing the updated count for `x`.
