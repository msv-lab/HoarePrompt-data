Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `res` will be the sum of several terms based on the values in `num_of_lens`. Specifically, for each key `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, `res` will be incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Additionally, for each `cnt` that is greater than or equal to 2, `res` will be further incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.**

This means that `res` accumulates contributions from combinations of counts in `num_of_lens` that meet certain criteria, reflecting the operations performed within the loop over all its iterations.
