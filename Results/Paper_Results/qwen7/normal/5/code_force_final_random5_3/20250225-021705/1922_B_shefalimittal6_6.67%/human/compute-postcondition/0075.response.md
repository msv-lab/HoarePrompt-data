Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`. Therefore, the only variable we need to consider is `cnt`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair. Additionally, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `cnt`**: Since `cnt` is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`, it will be the next value in the sequence of values in `num_of_lens`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `num_of_lens` must still have at least one key-value pair because the loop continues as long as there are more values to iterate over.
   - `res` will either remain unchanged or be updated based on the new value of `cnt`.
   - `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` excluding the current `cnt`. This means we need to exclude the current `cnt` from the calculation of `total_sum`.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `num_of_lens` must still have at least one key-value pair.
- `cnt` will be the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `res` will be adjusted based on the new `cnt` (either unchanged or updated).

Since we don't know the exact value of `cnt` until the loop runs, we can only say that `cnt` will be the next value in the sequence. However, we can express the state in terms of the conditions that must hold for the loop to continue.

**State:**
- `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair.
- `cnt` will be the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `res` will remain unchanged or be updated based on the new `cnt`.

Thus, the final state can be expressed as:

State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` will be the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`, and `res` will remain unchanged or be updated based on the new `cnt`**.
