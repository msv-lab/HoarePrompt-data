Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from the list `nums` is mapped to its frequency in `nums`, `res` is 0, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `res = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `res`. Since `res` was previously the sum of combinations, setting it to 0 does not affect the dictionary `num_of_lens`, the list `nums`, the variable `t`, or the variable `n`. The dictionary `num_of_lens` remains unchanged as it reflects the count of each integer in the original `nums` list, which is now an empty list. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables and the updated value of `res`.
