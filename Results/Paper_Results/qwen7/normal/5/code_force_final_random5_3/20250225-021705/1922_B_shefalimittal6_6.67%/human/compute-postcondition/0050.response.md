Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key `x` and value 2, `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the second element of `nums`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num_of_lens[x]` by adding 1 to its current value (which is initially 1). Therefore, the new value of `num_of_lens[x]` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
