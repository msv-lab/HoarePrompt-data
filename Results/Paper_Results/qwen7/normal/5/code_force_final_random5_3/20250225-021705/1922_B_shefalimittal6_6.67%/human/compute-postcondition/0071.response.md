Output State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged; `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all values in the dictionary `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`. This sum is stored in the variable `total_sum`. The conditions related to `cnt` and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `total_sum` and retains the original conditions for `cnt` and `res`.
