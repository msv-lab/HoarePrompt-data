State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The upper limit of `t` is given as \(10^4\), so `t` must be less than or equal to \(10^4\).
4. No other variables or states need to be adjusted since `_` is just a placeholder and `t` is the only variable used in the loop condition.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `t` meets the required conditions for the loop to execute.
