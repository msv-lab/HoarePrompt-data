Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` contains the sum of combinations, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code initializes `num_of_lens` as an empty dictionary. This operation does not affect the values of `res`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
