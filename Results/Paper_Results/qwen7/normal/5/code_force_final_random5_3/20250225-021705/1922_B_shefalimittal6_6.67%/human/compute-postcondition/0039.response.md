Postcondition: `res` is the original value of `res`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to the original value of `res` plus the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` times `total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.
