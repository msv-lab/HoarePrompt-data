Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` and its value is 2, `res` contains the sum of combinations, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num_of_lens[x]` by incrementing it by 1. Initially, `num_of_lens[x]` is 1. After executing the code, `num_of_lens[x]` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
