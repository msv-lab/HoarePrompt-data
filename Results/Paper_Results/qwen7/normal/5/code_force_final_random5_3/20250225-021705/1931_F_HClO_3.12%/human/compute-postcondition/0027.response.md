State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `n` must be greater than 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 (as `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n-2`).
3. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. This means `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run at least once.
4. **List the states that need adjustment**: The only variables directly involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Since `i` is set to 0 initially, we don't need to adjust it. However, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `n` must be greater than 1.
