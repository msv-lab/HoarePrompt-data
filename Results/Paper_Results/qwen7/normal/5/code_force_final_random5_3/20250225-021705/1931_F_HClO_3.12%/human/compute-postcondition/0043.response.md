Output State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is -1, `n` is greater than 1, the value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `l1[i + p1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
