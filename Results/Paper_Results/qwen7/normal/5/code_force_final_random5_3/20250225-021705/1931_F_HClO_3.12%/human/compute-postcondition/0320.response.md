Output State: **Postcondition: `m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `i + max(p1, p2)` is `n - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
