Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `a3` is the first integer from the input split and `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split, the list `val` now contains this single tuple. The values of `a3` and `l3` remain unchanged, and the list `val` is updated to include the new tuple.
