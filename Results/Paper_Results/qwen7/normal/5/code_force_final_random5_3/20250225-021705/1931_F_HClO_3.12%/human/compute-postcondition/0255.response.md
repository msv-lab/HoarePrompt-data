Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer entered, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers entered, `m` retains its original value, `t` retains its original value, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index 2, `l` is now a reference to `l1`**.

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns `l1` to `l`. This does not change the contents or values of any variables, but it changes the reference of `l` to point to the same list as `l1`. All other variables retain their initial states.
