Output State: **`a3` is the first element of the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the third tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`, and `m` is equal to 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `a3`, `l3`, `val`, or `m`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
