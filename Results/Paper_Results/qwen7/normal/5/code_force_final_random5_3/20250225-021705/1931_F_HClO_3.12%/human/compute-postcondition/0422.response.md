Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `m`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0, meaning `m > 2`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a3` is the first integer from the new input split.
   - `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input split.
   - `val` is a list containing two tuples `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`.
   - `m` must be greater than 3.
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating `m - 2` times, after each iteration, `m` is decreased by 1.
   - After the previous iteration, `m` was greater than 3, so it must have been at least 4.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 3, but now it will be `m - 1`.

Given this, if `m` was 4 before the previous iteration, it will be 3 after the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input split, `val` is a list containing two tuples `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, `m` must be greater than 3 and equal to 4**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input split, `val` is a list containing two tuples `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, `m` must be greater than 3 and equal to 4**.
