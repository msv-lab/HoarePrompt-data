Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are both 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, then `p2` becomes 1 if `p1` is not already 1. If the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` is met, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `p2` is set to 1 if `p1` is not 1.
