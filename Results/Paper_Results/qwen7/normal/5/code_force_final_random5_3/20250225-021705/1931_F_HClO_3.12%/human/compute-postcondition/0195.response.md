Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, and `i` is 0. If the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` is true, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to 0. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
