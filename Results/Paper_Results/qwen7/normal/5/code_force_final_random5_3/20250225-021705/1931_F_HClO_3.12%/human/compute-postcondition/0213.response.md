Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, and `i` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, `p1` is 1, and `p2` is 1. Otherwise, `p2` becomes 1.
