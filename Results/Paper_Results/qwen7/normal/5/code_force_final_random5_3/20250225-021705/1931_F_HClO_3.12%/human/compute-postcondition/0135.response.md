Output State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input converted to int, the current list `l3` is not equal to a new list created by taking all elements from `l` except those equal to `a3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `m`, `a3`, or `l3`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no new lists are created or modified, `l3` remains unchanged in terms of its elements and condition relative to `l`.
