Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `n`, and the conditions on `m` and the equality of `l1[i + p1]` being `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` being `a1` remain unchanged.
