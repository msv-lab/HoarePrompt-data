Output State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `n` is greater than 1, the value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, or `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `l2[i + p2]`.**

Explanation: The variable `p2` is assigned the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions involving `n`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, and `l2` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
