Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split**.

The code splits the input into two integers using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
