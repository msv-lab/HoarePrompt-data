Output State: **`m` must be at least 5; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `idx1` and `idx2` to -1. The condition regarding `l11` and `l22` is not affected by this code, so the precondition that if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop remains unchanged. Therefore, the only changes are that `idx1` and `idx2` are now both set to -1.
