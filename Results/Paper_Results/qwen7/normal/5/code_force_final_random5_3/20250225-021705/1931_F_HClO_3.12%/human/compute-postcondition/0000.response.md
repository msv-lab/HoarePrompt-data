Output State: **`t` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer, the input must also be a positive integer. All other variables (`n` and `k`) remain undefined and unchanged from their initial state.
