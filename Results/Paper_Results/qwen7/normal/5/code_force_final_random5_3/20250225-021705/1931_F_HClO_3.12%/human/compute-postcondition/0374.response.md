Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, or `i+1`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `p1 = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `p1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
