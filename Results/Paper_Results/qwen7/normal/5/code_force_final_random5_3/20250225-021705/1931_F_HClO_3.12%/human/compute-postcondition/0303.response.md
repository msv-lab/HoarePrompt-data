Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `t` must be greater than `current_index + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer (`a1`), `m` is the second integer from the input split and converted to an integer (not included in the list `l1`), `a2` is the third integer from the input split and converted to an integer, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split and converted to integers, `l11` is a list comprehension resulting in a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` which contains all elements from the original list `l1` except for `a2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
