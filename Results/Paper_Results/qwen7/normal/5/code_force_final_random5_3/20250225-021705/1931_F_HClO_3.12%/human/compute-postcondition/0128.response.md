Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes the input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. It does not affect the values of `m` or `val`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `m` and `val` remain unchanged, while `a3` and `l3` are updated based on the input.
