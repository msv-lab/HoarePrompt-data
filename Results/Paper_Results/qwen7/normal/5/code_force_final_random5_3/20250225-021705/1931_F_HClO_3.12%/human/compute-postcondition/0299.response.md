Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `t` must be greater than `current_index + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer, `m` is the second integer from the input split and converted to an integer, an empty line is read, we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement in the code simply moves the control to the next iteration of the loop without executing any further statements in the current iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the loop continues.
