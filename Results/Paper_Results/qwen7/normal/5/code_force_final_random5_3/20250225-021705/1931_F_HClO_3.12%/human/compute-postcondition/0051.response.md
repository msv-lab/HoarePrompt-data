Postcondition: `p1` and `p2` are either 1 and 0 respectively, or 0 and 1 respectively. `idx1` and `idx2` are either `i` and -1, or -1 and `i` respectively. `n` is greater than 1, the value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is `i`, and `idx2` is -1. Otherwise, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is -1, and `idx2` is `i`. Additionally, both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative.
