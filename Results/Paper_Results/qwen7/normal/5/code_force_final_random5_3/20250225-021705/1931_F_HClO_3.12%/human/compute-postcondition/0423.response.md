Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input split, `val` is a list containing two tuples `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, `m` is equal to 4**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. The variable `m` remains unchanged and is still equal to 4. The value of `val` remains the same as it was before the execution of the code.
