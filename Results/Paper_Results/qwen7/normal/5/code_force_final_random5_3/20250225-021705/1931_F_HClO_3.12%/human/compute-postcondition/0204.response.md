Output State: **`idx1` is 1, `idx2` is unchanged, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, and `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `idx1`. The value of `i` does not change, and none of the other variables (`idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t`) are affected. Therefore, they retain their original values.
