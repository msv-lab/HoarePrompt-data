Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is unchanged, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code sets `idx1` to the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables (`idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
