Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are both `i`, or `n-1` and `n-1`, or `n` and `n-1`, or `n-1` and `n`; `n` is greater than 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, or `n`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while noting that we have exited the relevant control structure.
