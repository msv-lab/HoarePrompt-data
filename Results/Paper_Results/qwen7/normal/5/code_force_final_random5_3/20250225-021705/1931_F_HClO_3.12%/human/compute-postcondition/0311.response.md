Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, input received but not stored or used.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `m` must be at least 5 because the loop runs `m - 2` times. The `input()` function is called during each iteration but the inputs are not stored or used in the given code.
