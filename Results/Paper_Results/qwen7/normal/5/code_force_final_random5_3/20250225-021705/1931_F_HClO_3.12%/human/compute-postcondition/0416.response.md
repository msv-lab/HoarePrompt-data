Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input. It converts each integer in the input into an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The first integer is assigned to `a3`, and the rest are collected into a list `l3`. The `*` operator is used to unpack the remaining integers into a list. Therefore, after executing this code, `a3` will hold the first integer, and `l3` will be a list of the remaining integers from the input.
