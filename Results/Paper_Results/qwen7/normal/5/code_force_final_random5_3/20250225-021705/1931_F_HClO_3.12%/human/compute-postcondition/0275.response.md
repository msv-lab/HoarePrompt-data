Output State: **`m` must be at least 4, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple: (`a3`, `l3`). After appending, `val` now contains two identical tuples: (`a3`, `l3`). All other variables remain unchanged.
