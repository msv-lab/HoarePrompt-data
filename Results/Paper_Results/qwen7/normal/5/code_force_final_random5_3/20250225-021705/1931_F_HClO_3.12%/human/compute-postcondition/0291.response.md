Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `a3` or `l3`, but it indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
