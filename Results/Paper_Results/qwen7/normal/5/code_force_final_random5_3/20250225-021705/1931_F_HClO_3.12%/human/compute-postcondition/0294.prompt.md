Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` must be at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `val` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), the second tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the third tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`).
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers. If the list `l3` does not contain all elements except `a3`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, and if `l3` does not contain all elements of `l` except `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
