Output State: `a3` is the first element of the fifth tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the fifth tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing five tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`, and `m` is equal to 3.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `a3` will be the first element of the fifth tuple added to the `val` list, and `l3` will be the second element of that same tuple. The `val` list will contain exactly five such tuples. Additionally, the variable `m` will be reduced to 3 after processing all inputs according to the logic within the loop.
