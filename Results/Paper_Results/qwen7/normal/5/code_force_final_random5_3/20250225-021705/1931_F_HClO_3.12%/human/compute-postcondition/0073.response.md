Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` and `n-1`, or `n` and `n-1`, or `n-1` and `n`; `n` is greater than 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that was being checked. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `n` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variable values.
