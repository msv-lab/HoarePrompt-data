Output State: **`m` must be at least 5 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement and the precondition that `m` must be at least 5 remains unchanged, the only information updated is that the loop will continue.
