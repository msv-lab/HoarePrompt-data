Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `m` is equal to 1, `a3` is the first integer input, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers input.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is decremented by 1, so `m` is now equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
