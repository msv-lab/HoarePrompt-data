Postcondition: `p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are either both `i`, or `n-1` and `n-1`, or `n` and `n-1`, or `n-1` and `n`; `n` is greater than 1. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
