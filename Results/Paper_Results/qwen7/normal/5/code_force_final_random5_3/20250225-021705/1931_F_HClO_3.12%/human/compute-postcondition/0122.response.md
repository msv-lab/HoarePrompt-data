Output State: **`m` must be at least 3, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input. It converts each element to an integer and assigns the first integer to the variable `a3`. The rest of the integers are collected into a list and assigned to `l3`. The precondition that `m` must be at least 3 remains unchanged.
