Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The code sets `idx1` and `idx2` both to the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, and `i` are updated, while the other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t`) retain their original values. The condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not relevant to the output state since the values of `i`, `p1`, and `p2` are known and no further calculation is needed for this condition.
