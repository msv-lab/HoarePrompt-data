Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`.
2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the condition `range(n - 1)` must be valid. This means `n - 1` must be a non-negative integer (greater than or equal to 0).

Given the initial states:
- `m` must be at least 5
- `idx1` is -1
- `idx2` is -1
- `p1` is 0
- `p2` is 0

We need to focus on adjusting the state of the variable `n` such that `n - 1` is a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
