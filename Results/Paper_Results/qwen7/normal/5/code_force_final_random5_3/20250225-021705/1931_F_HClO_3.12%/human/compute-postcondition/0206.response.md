Output State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, `i` is 1, `idx2` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `idx2` is also set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
