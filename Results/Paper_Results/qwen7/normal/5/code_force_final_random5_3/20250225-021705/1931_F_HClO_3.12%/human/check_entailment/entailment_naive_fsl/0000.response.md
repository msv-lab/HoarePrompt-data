Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to correctly validate the order of participants across multiple screenshots when the initial orders differ significantly.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
4 3
1 2 3 4
2 3 1 4
3 2 1 4
4 2 3 1
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
NO
```

This happens because the program incorrectly assumes that the initial order of participants must match exactly between the first two screenshots. In this case, the first screenshot shows `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, but subsequent screenshots show different initial positions for the same participants, leading the program to incorrectly conclude that no consistent order exists.

To correctly handle such cases, the program needs to ensure that the relative order of participants remains consistent across all screenshots, not just the initial order. The current implementation fails to account for this requirement, making it incorrect for the given problem description.
