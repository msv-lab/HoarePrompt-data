Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The loop variable `_` is an underscore, which is a common practice when the loop variable is not needed within the loop body. However, the loop itself depends on the value of `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop runs `m - 2` times. For the loop to execute one more time, `m - 2` must be greater than 0, which means `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: The state is given as `m` must be greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be such that `m - 2` is still greater than 0. This means `m` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`m` must be greater than 3**.
