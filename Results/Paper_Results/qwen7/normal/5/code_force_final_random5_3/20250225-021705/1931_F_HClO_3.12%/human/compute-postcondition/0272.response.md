Output State: **`m` must be at least 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(a3, l3)`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple `(a3, l3)`. After executing the line `val.append((a3, l3))`, `val` now contains two tuples: the original tuple and the newly appended tuple. All other variables remain unchanged.
