Postcondition: **`m` is at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, ..., or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, ..., or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and we continue the loop.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `m == 2` is true or false, the variables retain their constraints and the loop continues.
