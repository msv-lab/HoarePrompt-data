Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**

Explanation: The code sets `idx1` and `idx2` both to `i`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
