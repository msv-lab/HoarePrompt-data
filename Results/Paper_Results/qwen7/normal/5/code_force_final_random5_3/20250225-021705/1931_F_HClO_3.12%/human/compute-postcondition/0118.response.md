Postcondition: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, the value of `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)` or `l` is a reference to a list `l1` with an element `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `m` is equal to 1, `a3` is the first integer input, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers input.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If the condition `idx1 > idx2` is true, then `val` will contain a tuple as described in the if part. Otherwise, `l` will be a reference to a modified list `l1` as described in the else part.
