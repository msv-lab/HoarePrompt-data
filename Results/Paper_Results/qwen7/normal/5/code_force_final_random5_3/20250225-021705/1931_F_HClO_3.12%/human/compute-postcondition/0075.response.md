Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are both `i`, or `n-1` and `n-1`, or `n` and `n-1`, or `n-1` and `n`; `n` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `idx1` and `idx2` to the same value `i`. This means that regardless of the initial values of `idx1` and `idx2`, they will now both be equal to `i`. The conditions involving `p1`, `p2`, and `n` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on these variables.
