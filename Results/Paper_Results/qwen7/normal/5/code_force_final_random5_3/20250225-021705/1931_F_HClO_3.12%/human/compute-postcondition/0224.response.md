Output State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, `i` is 2, `idx2` is 2.**

Explanation: The code sets `idx2` to the value of `i`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
