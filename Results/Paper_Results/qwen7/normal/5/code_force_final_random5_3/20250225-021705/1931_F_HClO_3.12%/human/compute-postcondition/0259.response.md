Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer entered, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers entered, `m` retains its original value, `t` retains its original value, and `a1`, `a2`, and `l11`, `l22` retain their original values. `l2` is assigned to `l`, meaning `l` now refers to the same list as `l2`.**

In this case, the code simply assigns `l2` to `l`, which means `l` now points to the same list as `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
