Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, `val` is an empty list, `m` is equal to 2, `a3` is the first integer input, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers input, `l2` has had the element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l` is a reference to `l2`**.

The code `l = l2` does not change the values of any variables but rather creates a new reference `l` that points to the same list as `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
