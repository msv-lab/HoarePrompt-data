Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input split, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is 1, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, and `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` takes the input split into a list, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a2` and the rest to `l2`. The initial values of `a1`, `l1`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
