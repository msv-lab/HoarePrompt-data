Output State: **`success` is `False`, `i` is `t-1`, `distance` is `abs(position)'`, `time_available` is `abs(position)'`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `total_bullets_used` plus `bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `position` and `health` are assigned the values from `monsters[i]`**.

Explanation: The line `success = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `success`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `distance`, `time_available`, `bullets_needed`, `total_bullets_used`, `position`, and `health` remain unchanged from their initial states.
