Output State: **`i` is 0; `bullets_needed` is `health`; `position` is its original value; `health` is its original value; `distance` is the absolute value of `position`; `time_available` is equal to `distance`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `health` to `bullets_needed`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, and `time_available` remain unchanged.
