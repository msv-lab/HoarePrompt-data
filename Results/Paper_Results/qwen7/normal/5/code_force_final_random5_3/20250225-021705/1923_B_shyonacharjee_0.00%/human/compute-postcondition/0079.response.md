Output State: `success` is False, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `i` is -1, `bullets_needed` is the `health` of the current monster (which is now the last monster since `i` is -1), `position` is the `position` of the current monster (which is now the last monster's position), `health` is the `health` of the current monster, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is `distance`, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will decrement to -1 because it starts from `n-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1. The loop checks if adding the current monster's bullets needed (`bullets_needed`) to `total_bullets_used` exceeds `time_available`. Since the condition `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available` was met at some point (as indicated by the first three outputs where `success` is False), the loop breaks, and `success` remains False. The `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters because the loop adds the health of each monster to `total_bullets_used` without any further additions or subtractions once the loop breaks. The `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster, `position` is the position of the last monster, and `health` is the health of the last monster. `distance` is the absolute value of the last monster's position, and `time_available` is also equal to `distance`.
