You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
        total_bullets_used = 0
        success = True
        for i in range(n):
            (position, health) = monsters[i]
            distance = abs(position)
            time_available = distance
            bullets_needed = health
            if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
                success = False
                break
            total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
        print('YES' if success else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, k, a sequence of health values, and a sequence of positions. For each test case, it calculates whether it's possible to defeat all monsters within the given constraints. If it's possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple monsters can be within the same distance from the player. Specifically, the program sorts the monsters based on their absolute positions and then checks if the total bullets used exceed the time available to kill them. However, it does not account for the fact that multiple monsters can be within the same distance and require the same number of bullets to be killed. This can lead to an incorrect conclusion about whether the player can survive.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 2
1 1 1
-1 1 1
```

In this case, the player can kill all monsters in the first second by firing 2 bullets at the monsters at position 1. However, the program would incorrectly conclude that the player cannot survive because it does not account for the fact that both monsters at position 1 can be killed with the available bullets in the same second.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the total number of bullets required to kill all monsters within the same distance does not exceed the available time. This can be achieved by grouping monsters by their distances and ensuring that the total bullets needed for each group do not exceed the time available.
