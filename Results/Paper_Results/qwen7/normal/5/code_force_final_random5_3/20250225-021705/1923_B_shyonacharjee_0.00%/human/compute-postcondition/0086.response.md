Output State: **`success` is False, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `i` is t-1, `bullets_needed` is 0, `position` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is abs(position), `time_available` is distance, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions, `positions` is a list of integers read from the input using `map(int, input().split)`; `monsters` is now a list of tuples where each tuple contains a position and a health, sorted by the absolute value of the position.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `monsters` list by the absolute value of their positions. The original values of `success`, `total_bullets_used`, `i`, `bullets_needed`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, `healths`, `n`, `k`, and `positions` remain unchanged. The `monsters` list is updated to reflect the new order based on the absolute value of the positions.
