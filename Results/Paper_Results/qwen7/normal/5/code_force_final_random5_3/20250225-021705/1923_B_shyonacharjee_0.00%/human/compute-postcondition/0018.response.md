Output State: **`i` is 0, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `position` is its original value, `health` is its original value, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `health`, and `success` is False.**

Explanation: The code `total_bullets_used += bullets_needed` increments the value of `total_bullets_used` by the value of `bullets_needed`. Given the initial state, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`. Therefore, `total_bullets_used` is updated to `health`. All other variables remain unchanged.
