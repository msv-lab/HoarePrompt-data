Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4; the value of t is now an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
    positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
    total_bullets_used = 0
    success = True
    for i in range(n):
        position, health = monsters[i]
        distance = abs(position)
        time_available = distance
        bullets_needed = health
        if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
            success = False
            break
        total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
    print('YES' if success else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `bullets_needed` is `health` for the last monster in the list, `position` is the position of the last monster in the list, `health` is the health of the last monster in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, and `success` is False.

This is because the loop iterates over each monster in the list, and for each iteration, it calculates the necessary bullets needed, updates the `total_bullets_used`, and sets `success` to False as soon as the condition `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available` is met. Since the loop breaks as soon as this condition is satisfied, `success` remains False throughout the entire process, and `total_bullets_used` accumulates the health of all monsters up to the point where the condition is first met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `success` is False, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `i` is -1, `bullets_needed` is 0, `position` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is `distance`, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is a positive integer, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have been decremented until it reaches -1, as the loop runs from `n-1` down to 0. The `success` variable remains False because the condition `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available` was met at some point during the loop's execution, causing the loop to break. The `total_bullets_used` variable accumulates the sum of the healths of all monsters, and since the loop breaks before considering any further monsters, `bullets_needed` becomes 0. The `position` and `health` variables hold the values of the last monster in the list, and `distance` is calculated as the absolute value of this position. The `time_available` is set to this distance. All other variables retain their values from the final iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `success` is `False`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the `health` values of all monsters, `bullets_needed` is the last `health` value, `position` is `monsters[n-1][0]`, `health` is `monsters[n-1][1]`, `distance` is `abs(position)`, and `time_available` is `distance`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n-1` since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The loop breaks as soon as the condition `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available` is met, which happens at the second iteration based on the given output states. Therefore, `success` remains `False`. The `total_bullets_used` accumulates the sum of all `bullets_needed` (which is equivalent to the sum of all `health` values) up until the point where the loop breaks. The `position` and `health` variables hold the values of the last monster in the `monsters` list, and `distance` and `time_available` are calculated based on these values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
