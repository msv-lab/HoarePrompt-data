Output State: **`success` is False, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters plus `bullets_needed`, `i` is `i-1`, `bullets_needed` is the `health` of the current monster, `position` is the `position` of the current monster, `health` is the `health` of the current monster, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is `distance`, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions, the current `position` and `health` are assigned from the tuple `monsters[i]`.**

In this output state, the variables `success`, `total_bullets_used`, `i`, `bullets_needed`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, `healths`, `n`, `positions`, and `monsters` retain their initial conditions except for `i`, which is decremented by 1, and `position` and `health`, which are now specific values from the tuple `monsters[i]`.
