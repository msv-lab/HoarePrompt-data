Output State: **`success` is True, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `i` is `n-2`, `bullets_needed` is `health` for the last monster in the list, `position` is the position of the current monster, `health` is the health of the current monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the current monster, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions.**

Explanation: The line `position, health = monsters[i]` unpacks the tuple `monsters[i]` into the variables `position` and `health`. Since `i` was initially `n-1`, after this line, `i` is updated to `n-2`. The values of `position` and `health` are set to the position and health of the current monster, which is the one at index `i` in the `monsters` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
