Output State: **`success` is True, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `i` is t-1, `bullets_needed` is 0, `position` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is abs(position), `time_available` is distance, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions, `positions` is a list of integers read from the input using `map(int, input().split)`, `total_bullets_used` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `success = True` sets the variable `success` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
