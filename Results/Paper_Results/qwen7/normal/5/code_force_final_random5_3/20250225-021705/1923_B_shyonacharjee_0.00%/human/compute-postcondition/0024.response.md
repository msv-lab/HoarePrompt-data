Output State: **`i` is 1, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `position` is updated to `monsters[1][0]`, `health` is updated to `monsters[1][1]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `health`, and `success` is False.**

Explanation: The line `success = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `success`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `bullets_needed`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, and `total_bullets_used` remain unchanged from their initial states.
