Postcondition: `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `position` is `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is `distance`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + health`, and `success` remains `False` because either the condition `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available` is true, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no else part which would change these values.
