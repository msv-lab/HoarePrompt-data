Output State: **`bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `position` is `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is `distance`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + health`, and `success` is `False`**

Explanation: The line `success = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `success`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
