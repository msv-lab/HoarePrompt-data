Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `mex` is updated to the minimum value between `mex` and `p[i]`
   - `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop starts from `n - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`.

4. **Current Iteration**: Since the loop is iterating backwards, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 1`. Therefore, the current value of `i` is `n - 2`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will now be `n - 2`.
   - `mex` remains unchanged because the update to `mex` happens inside the loop, but we don't know the exact value of `mex` yet.
   - `p[i]` (which is `p[n-2]`) will be updated to the minimum value between `mex` and `p[n-2]` if the loop body updates it.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the new value of `i` and the potential update to `p[i]`:

**State:**
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `mex` is updated to the minimum value between `mex` and `p[n-2]`
- `p[n-2]` is `mex - a[n-2]`

However, since we don't know the exact value of `mex` from the previous iteration, we can only definitively say that `i` will be `n - 2`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `n - 2`**
