Output State: **`i` is `n-1`; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Here, `i` is initially `n-1`, and `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is set to `n-1`, `i` remains `n-1`. The value of `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` and `a[i]` are not specified further, so they remain as they are.
