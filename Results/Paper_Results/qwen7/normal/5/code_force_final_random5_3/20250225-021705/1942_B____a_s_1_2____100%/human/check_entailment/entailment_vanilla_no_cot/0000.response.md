Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors and does not correctly implement the algorithm to find the permutation \( p \).

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The logic to calculate the MEX is flawed. The current implementation tries to compute the MEX in reverse order, which is not correct. The MEX should be computed for the prefix of the array up to index \( i \), not in reverse.

2. **Setting `mex` to `n`**: The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which might not always be the correct value for the MEX calculation. It should be dynamically updated based on the values in the permutation array \( p \).

3. **Updating `mex` Incorrectly**: The `mex` value is being updated incorrectly. It should be updated based on the values already placed in the permutation array \( p \).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used.add(p[i])
        
        print(*p)
```

This corrected version ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated for each position in the permutation array \( p \). It uses a set to keep track of the used values and iterates to find the correct MEX for each position.
