Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The initial state of `t` being greater than 0 and `n` being an input integer remains unchanged. The new variable `a` is created and assigned the list of integers obtained from the input.
