Based on the initial state described, let's break down the process:

1. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `n-1` down to `0`, updating the list `p` and the variable `mex` according to the rules provided.
2. **Final Values**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `-1`, meaning the loop has processed every index from `n-1` down to `0`.
3. **List `p`**: Each element `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]` during the loop, and `mex` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `p[i]` for each iteration.
4. **Output**: The `print(*p)` statement will print the contents of the list `p`.

Given that the exact values of `a` and `mex` are not specified, we can only describe the final state of `p` in terms of the operations performed on it.

Output: **p (where p is a list of values calculated as mex - a[i] for each i from n-1 down to 0, with mex being updated to the minimum value between its current value and p[i] for each iteration)**
