Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `mex` is updated to the minimum value between `mex` and `p[i]`; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum value between its current value and `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]`, the value of `p[i]` remains unchanged, but `mex` is updated based on the comparison.
