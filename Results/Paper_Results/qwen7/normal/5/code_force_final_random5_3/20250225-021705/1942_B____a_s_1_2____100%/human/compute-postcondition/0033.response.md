Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `p[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` will be equal to `mex - a[i]`. The variable `mex` will be the minimum value found among all `p[i]` after updating `p[i]` for every index `i`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `p` will contain the difference between `mex` and each element in `a`, and `mex` will be the smallest value in the updated `p` array.
