Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A list `p` of size `n` is initialized with `-1` values.
   - A variable `mex` is set to `n`, which will be used to find the MEX value.

3. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The loop runs from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the permutation `p`.

### Reasoning:

1. **Correct Calculation of MEX:**
   - The key idea is to calculate the MEX value for the suffix of the permutation starting from `i` to the end.
   - The value `mex - a[i]` ensures that the MEX value is correctly assigned to `p[i]` because `a[i]` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - This approach works because we are calculating the MEX from the end of the array towards the beginning, ensuring that the MEX value is correctly propagated.

2. **Updating MEX:**
   - The `mex` value is updated to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest unused index in the permutation.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles all edge cases as per the problem statement. It guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists, and the constraints are respected.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
