Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `p` of length `n` filled with the value `-1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
