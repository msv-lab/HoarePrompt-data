Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`. For each `i` from `n-1` down to `0`, the variable `p[i]` will be set to `mex - a[i]`, and `mex` will be updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `p[i]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `p`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `i` will have decremented past `-1`, meaning the loop has processed every index from `n-1` down to `0`. The list `p` will contain values calculated based on `mex` and the corresponding elements of `a`, with `mex` being the smallest value found among these calculations.
