Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (since the loop runs for `t` iterations, and each iteration reduces `t` by 1). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1**.

This means that after decrementing `t` by 1, `t` should still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.
