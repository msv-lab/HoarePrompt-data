Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
- `a` is a list containing 4 lists, each list contains integers inputted by the user.
- `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`.
- `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(dx * dx)
```

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression `dx * dx`:

1. `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.
2. Therefore, `dx * dx` is the square of this difference.

Since the exact values of the integers inputted by the user are not specified, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **dx^2 (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x)**
