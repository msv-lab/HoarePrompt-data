You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        print(dx * dx)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four points defining a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It calculates the side length of each square (the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates) and prints the square of this side length for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the program step by step to determine if it correctly calculates the area of the square given the coordinates of its corners.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates (x, y).

2. **Coordinate Extraction:**
   - It stores these coordinates in a list of lists `a`.
   - It extracts the x-coordinates into a separate list `x`.

3. **Calculating Side Length:**
   - The side length of the square can be determined by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.
   - This is because the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, so the side length is simply the distance between the farthest left and right points.

4. **Area Calculation:**
   - The area of the square is calculated as `dx * dx`, where `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.
   - Since the square is also aligned with the y-axis, the side length will be the same in both dimensions, ensuring the area calculation is correct.

### Verification:

Given the constraints and the problem statement, this approach should work correctly. Here’s why:

- The coordinates of the square's corners are given, and since the square is aligned with the axes, the differences in x-coordinates directly give the side length.
- The area of a square is the side length squared, which is exactly what the program does.

### Example Verification:

- For the first test case:
  - Coordinates: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
  - Maximum x-coordinate: 4
  - Minimum x-coordinate: 1
  - Side length: 4 - 1 = 3
  - Area: 3 * 3 = 9

- For the second test case:
  - Coordinates: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
  - Maximum x-coordinate: 1
  - Minimum x-coordinate: -1
  - Side length: 1 - (-1) = 2
  - Area: 2 * 2 = 4

- For the third test case:
  - Coordinates: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
  - Maximum x-coordinate: 45
  - Minimum x-coordinate: 17
  - Side length: 45 - 17 = 28
  - Area: 28 * 28 = 784

The program correctly handles all the examples provided.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the area of the square given the coordinates of its corners. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
