Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly identifies the side length of the square by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the four given points. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in the x-coordinates will be equal to the side length of the square, and similarly, the difference in the y-coordinates would yield the same side length. The program then squares this side length to get the area of the square and prints it for each test case.

However, the program only considers the differences in the x-coordinates to determine the side length. To ensure correctness, we should also check the differences in the y-coordinates. If the differences in both x and y coordinates are the same, it confirms that the points form a square. If they are different, the points do not form a square, which contradicts the problem statement.

Given that the problem guarantees the existence of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the current implementation is sufficient. The program correctly calculates the area of the square based on the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**
