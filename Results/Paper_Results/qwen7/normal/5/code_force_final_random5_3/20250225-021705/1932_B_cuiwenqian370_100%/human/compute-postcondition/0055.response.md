Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]), `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + a[2]) // a[2] * a[2])**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_year` to ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]), which simplifies to ((`last_year` + a[2]) // a[2] * a[2]). The values of `i`, `n`, `last_year`, and the expression for `next_year` remain as they were initially, except `next_year` now has the updated value.
