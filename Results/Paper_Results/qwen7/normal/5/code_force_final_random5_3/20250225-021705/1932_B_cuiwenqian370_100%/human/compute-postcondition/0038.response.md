Output State: **`i` is `i + 3`, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i+3] - 1) // a[i+3] * a[i+3]`, `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`**.

Explanation: The line `last_year = next_year` assigns the value of `next_year` to `last_year`. Therefore, `last_year` now holds the same value as `next_year`. The values of `i`, `last_year`, and `next_year` are updated according to their respective formulas, but since `last_year` is reassigned, its new value is the same as `next_year`.
