Output State: **`i` is 3, `last_year` is equal to (last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2], and `next_year` is not affected.**

Explanation: The code updates `last_year` to be equal to `next_year`. Since `next_year` was previously calculated as `(last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]`, the new value of `last_year` is now this expression. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `next_year` is no longer affected by the code since it is not reassigned.
