Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `last_year` is equal to `next_year`
   - `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration where `i` was 2, the next value of `i` would be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 2 (since it hasn't changed yet).

4. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 3
   - `n` must still be greater than 2
   - The values of `last_year` and `next_year` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])**
