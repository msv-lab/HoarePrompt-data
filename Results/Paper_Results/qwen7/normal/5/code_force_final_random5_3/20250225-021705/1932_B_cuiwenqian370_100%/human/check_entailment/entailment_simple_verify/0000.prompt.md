You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    #State: Output State: `i` is `n`, `last_year` is the final value obtained by applying the update rule `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]` for each `i` from `1` to `n-1`, and `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` for each iteration of T.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `index` will have advanced through the data list, `T` times, processing each set of `n` integers and their corresponding operations. The variable `last_year` will hold the final computed value after applying the given update rule for all elements in the list `a` for each iteration. Since the loop appends the final `last_year` value as a string to the `results` list in each iteration, `results` will contain the final `last_year` value as a string for each of the `T` iterations. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop completes, indicating that the loop has processed all `n` elements in the list `a` for each of the `T` iterations.
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur. Specifically, the logic used to determine the next year when a sign will occur is flawed. 

For instance, consider the input:
```
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

The program should calculate the year when the 6th sign will occur based on the sequential occurrence of the previous signs. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this sequential logic. 

To illustrate, let's walk through the example step-by-step:
1. The first sign occurs in year 50.
2. The second sign occurs in year 51 (since the first sign occurred in year 50, we start from year 51).
3. The third sign occurs in year 51 + 711 = 762 (since the second sign occurred in year 51, we start from year 51).
4. The fourth sign occurs in year 762 + 200 = 962 (since the third sign occurred in year 762, we start from year 762).
5. The fifth sign occurs in year 962 + 503 = 1465 (since the fourth sign occurred in year 962, we start from year 962).
6. The sixth sign occurs in year 1465 + 1006 = 2471 (since the fifth sign occurred in year 1465, we start from year 1465).

However, the program incorrectly calculates the next year for each sign, leading to an incorrect result. For example, the program might incorrectly calculate the next year for the third sign as 51 + 711, which is not correct because it should be the next multiple of 711 after 51. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the year when all signs will occur sequentially.
