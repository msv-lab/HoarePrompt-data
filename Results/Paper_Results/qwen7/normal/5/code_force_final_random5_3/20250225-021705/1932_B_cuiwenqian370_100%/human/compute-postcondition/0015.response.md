Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `last_year` is calculated as `(last_year + 1 - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, `i` must be 2 for the next iteration.
   - For `i` to be 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to update `i` to 2.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `last_year` remains unchanged from the previous state.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
