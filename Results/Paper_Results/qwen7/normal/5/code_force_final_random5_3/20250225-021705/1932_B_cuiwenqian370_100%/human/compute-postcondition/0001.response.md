Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
