### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It initializes an index variable to keep track of the current position in the data list.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It calculates the year when the last sign occurs by iterating through the periodicities and updating the `last_year` accordingly.

3. **Calculating the Year**:
   - For each periodicity `a[i]`, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur after the previous sign has occurred.
   - This calculation uses the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` to find the next multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

4. **Storing Results**:
   - It stores the final year for each test case in the `results` list.

5. **Output**:
   - It writes the results to the standard output, joining them with newlines.

#### Correctness Check

1. **Formula Verification**:
   - The formula used to calculate the next year is correct. It ensures that the next year is a multiple of `a[i]` and strictly greater than `last_year`.

2. **Logic Flow**:
   - The logic flow is correct. It correctly updates `last_year` for each sign and calculates the correct year when the last sign occurs.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases efficiently by reading all input at once and processing each one sequentially.
   - It correctly handles the periodicities and ensures that the years are calculated correctly.

#### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations

- **Initial State**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and the list `a` contains `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\).
- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  - For each test case, the program correctly extracts `n` and the list `a`.
  - It initializes `last_year` to `a[0]`.
  - It iterates through the periodicities `a[i]` for \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), updating `last_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
  - The formula ensures that `last_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
  - The final value of `last_year` after the loop is the year when the \(n\)-th sign occurs.

#### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the program and comparing it with the problem description and the provided annotations, we can confirm that the program correctly calculates the year when the \(n\)-th sign occurs for each test case.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
