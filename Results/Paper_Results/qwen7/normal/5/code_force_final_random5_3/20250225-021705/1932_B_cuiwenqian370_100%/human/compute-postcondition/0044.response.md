Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`, `n` is an input integer, `index` is increased by 1.**

In this case, the code `index += 1` simply increments the value of the variable `index` by 1. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `T`, `i`, `last_year`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
