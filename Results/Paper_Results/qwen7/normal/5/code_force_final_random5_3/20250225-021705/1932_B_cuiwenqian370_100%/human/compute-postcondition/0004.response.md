Output State: **`index` is 2, `T` is an integer from the data list at position 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.**

The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `T`, `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.
