Output State: **`i` is `i + 3`, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i+3] - 1) // a[i+3] * a[i+3]`, `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `next_year` based on the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. It does not affect `i` or `last_year` directly, but it uses them in the calculation. The value of `i` remains `i + 3` from the initial state. The value of `last_year` is updated according to the given formula using `a[i+3]`. Similarly, the value of `next_year` is updated using the formula involving `a[i]`.
