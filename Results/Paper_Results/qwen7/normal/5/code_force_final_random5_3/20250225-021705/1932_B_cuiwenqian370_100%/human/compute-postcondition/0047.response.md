Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `last_year` is `a[0]`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `a[0]`, `n` is an input integer, `index` is `index + n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`**.

Explanation:
- The code sets `last_year` to `a[0]`. This means the value of `last_year` is now the first element of the list `a`.
- All other variables (`T`, `i`, `results`, `n`, `index`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
