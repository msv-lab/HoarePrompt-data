Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 2; `a` has an additional element which is equal to `a[1] + T[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends to list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression becomes `a[1] + T[1]`. Since no specific values for `a` and `T` were provided, we know that `a` now includes this new element. The conditions for `n` and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
