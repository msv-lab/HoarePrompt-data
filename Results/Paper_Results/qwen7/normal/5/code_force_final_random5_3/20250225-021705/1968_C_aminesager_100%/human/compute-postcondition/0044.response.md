Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list with an additional element equal to `a[i - 1] + a[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends to the list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] + a[i - 1]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[i - 1]`. The initial state of `i` being `i + 2` is already updated, and `n` remains as an input integer. The list `a` now has one more element, which is twice the value of the element just before the last element added.
