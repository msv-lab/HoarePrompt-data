Output State: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from `T`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `n` will be the final value it was set to, which must be greater than 2. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The list `a` will contain `n` elements, where each element `a[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements from the list `T`.
