Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is false, `T` is a list of integers converted from the input string `line`, `line` is the input string entered by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` converts the input string `line` into a list of integers `T`. Each element in `T` is an integer obtained by splitting the string `line` and converting each part to an integer.
- The variables `n`, `i`, `a`, `result`, `t`, and `line` remain unchanged from their initial states.
