Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by the variable `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, where `n` represents the number of elements in a sequence and `x` is a list of `n-1` integers. It then calculates the cumulative sum of the sequence starting from 1000 and appends each sum to a list `a`. Finally, it prints the list `a` as a space-separated string for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the cumulative sums for all provided sequences.**
