Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the first `i-1` elements from the list `T`, `result` is a string containing the cumulative sums separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code snippet performs the following operations:

1. The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`, updating the list `a` such that each element `a[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements from the list `T`.
2. After the loop completes, the `result` variable is assigned the string representation of the list `a`, with each element converted to a string and joined by spaces.

Since the loop has completed, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` contains the cumulative sums as described. The `result` variable now holds a string representation of these cumulative sums, formatted as specified.
