Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `a` is updated by appending the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to it.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`. Since `i` is less than `n`, `i - 1` is a valid index for both `a` and `T`. However, the specific values of `a` and `T` are not given, so we can only say that `a` is updated by adding this new element. The condition `i < n` remains true unless `i` is incremented or `n` is modified elsewhere in the code.
