Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` was incremented by 1 from the previous value).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list with an additional element equal to `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, the new value of `i` is `i + 1 + 1 = i + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 2` must be less than `n`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is an input integer.
   - The list `a` will have an additional element, but this detail does not affect the loop condition directly.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list with an additional element equal to `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`**
