Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the first `i-1` elements from the list `T`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`. The list `a` will contain `n` elements, where each element `a[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements from the list `T`. This is because in each iteration of the loop, `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` adds the next cumulative sum to the list `a`.
