You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer where 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are still characters in `num` that are '0' from the end of the string. After all iterations, `counter` will hold the total count of '0's from the end of `num` until it encounters a non-zero digit. If `num` consists entirely of '0's, `counter` will equal the length of `num`. If `num` does not contain any '0's, `counter` will be 0. The variable `i` will be set to -1 after the loop ends, indicating that the loop has completed all possible iterations.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `counter` variable will hold the number of trailing zeros in the integer `num` (if `num` is represented as a string). The `i` variable will be -1, signifying the end of the loop.
    return counter
    #The program returns the count of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`, and `i` is set to -1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter num, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9. It returns the count of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`, and sets `i` to -1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the count of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`, and `i` is set to -1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
