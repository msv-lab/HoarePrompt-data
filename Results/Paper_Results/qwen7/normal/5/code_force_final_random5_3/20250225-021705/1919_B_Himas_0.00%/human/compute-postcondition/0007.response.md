Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` equals '+', `P` is 1**.

The variable `P` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which was at least 0 since it's a non-negative integer). Given no specific initial value for `P` was mentioned, we can only say that `P` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
