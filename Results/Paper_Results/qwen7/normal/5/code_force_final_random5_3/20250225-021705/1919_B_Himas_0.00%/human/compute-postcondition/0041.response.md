Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `q` which iterates over each character in the string `e`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `e`. After each iteration, `e` becomes one character shorter.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `e` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before).
   - `q` is the next character in the string `e`.
   - `P` is 2 if `q` is '+', otherwise `M` is 2.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `e` is one character shorter, it means the next character `q` will be the next character in the shortened string `e`.
   - For the loop to continue, `e` must still be a non-empty string. Therefore, `e` must have at least one more character.
   - `P` or `M` will be set based on the value of the next character `q`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:

- `e` must be a non-empty string but now one character shorter than before.
- `q` will be the next character in the shortened string `e`.
- `P` will be 2 if `q` is '+', otherwise `M` will be 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `e` is a non-empty string (two characters shorter than before), `q` is the next character in the string `e`, `P` is 2 if `q` is '+', otherwise `M` is 2.**
