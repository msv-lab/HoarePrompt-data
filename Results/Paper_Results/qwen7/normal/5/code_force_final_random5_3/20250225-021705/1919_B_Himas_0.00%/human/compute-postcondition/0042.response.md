Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `q` is derived from the string `e`.
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `e`.

2. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - `e` is a non-empty string.
   - `q` is the next character in the string `e`.
   - `P` is 2 if `q` is '+', otherwise `M` is 2.

3. **Determine the Changes After One Iteration:**
   - Since `q` is the next character in `e`, after one iteration, `e` will be one character shorter.
   - `q` will now be the next character in the updated `e`.

4. **Update the States:**
   - `e` becomes a non-empty string that is one character shorter than before.
   - `q` becomes the next character in the updated `e`.
   - `P` remains 2 if `q` is '+', otherwise `M` remains 2.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`e` is a non-empty string that is one character shorter than before, `q` is the next character in the string `e`, `P` is 2 if `q` is '+', otherwise `M` is 2**.
