### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement step-by-step.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- Given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
- Convert `s` into an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
- The goal is to split `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty is minimized.
- The penalty of a subarray `b` of length `m` is `|sum(b)| * m`.

#### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())  # This should be the length of the string, not the string itself
        e = input()       # This should be the string 's'
        P = 0
        M = 0
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        print(P - M)
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The variable `s` is assigned the length of the string `e` instead of the string itself. This means `s` is an integer, not a string.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program counts the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string `e` and prints their difference (`P - M`). However, this does not align with the problem requirements. The program should calculate the penalty based on the optimal split of the array `a`.

#### Correct Approach:
- Convert the string `e` into an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
- Find the optimal way to split `a` to minimize the total penalty.
- The optimal strategy is to split the array at every position where the cumulative sum changes sign, as this minimizes the penalty.

#### Example Walkthrough:
- For the input `-----` (length 5):
  - The array `a` is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`.
  - The optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])`, resulting in a penalty of `5`.

- For the input `+-+` (length 3):
  - The array `a` is `[1, -1, 1]`.
  - The optimal split is `([1, -1], [1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`.

- For the input `--+++++++` (length 10):
  - The array `a` is `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - The optimal split is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, resulting in a penalty of `4`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It simply counts the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string, which does not align with the intended calculation of the penalty. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
