Output State: **`e` is an input string with at least one character, `P` is 1 if `q` was '+', and `M` is 2 if `q` was not '+'.**

Explanation: The variable `M` is incremented by 1. Since `M` was initially 1 if `q` was not '+', it now becomes 2. The value of `e` and the condition for `P` remain unchanged.
