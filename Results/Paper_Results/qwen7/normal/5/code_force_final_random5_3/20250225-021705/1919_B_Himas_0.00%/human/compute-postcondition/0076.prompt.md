You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length n.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        
        e = input()
        
        P = 0
        
        M = 0
        
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        
        print(P - M)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `P` will be equal to the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`, and `M` will be equal to the total number of '-' or any other character in the string `e`. The variable `i` will be equal to the number of test cases `t`, `s` will remain as the initial integer input, and `e` will be the last string input after all iterations.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `P` will count all the '+' characters, and `M` will count all other characters (including '-') from the last input string `e`. The variable `i` will reflect the total number of test cases, `s` will keep its initial value, and `e` will be the string input corresponding to the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. The function returns either a specific value or an error message based on the conditions provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
