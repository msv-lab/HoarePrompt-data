Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e`, `M` is incremented by 1**.

Given the initial state, `M` was either 2 or 1 depending on whether `q` was '+' or not. After executing `M += 1`, `M` is incremented by 1 regardless of its initial value. Therefore, `M` is now 3 if `q` was '+', and 2 if `q` was not '+'. However, since the exact initial value of `M` is not specified, we only know that `M` has been incremented by 1.
