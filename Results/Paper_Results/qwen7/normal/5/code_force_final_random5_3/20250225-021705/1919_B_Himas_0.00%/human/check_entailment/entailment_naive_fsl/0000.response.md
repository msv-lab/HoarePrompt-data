Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the string input as an array of characters representing +1 and -1 values. Instead, it treats the string as a sequence of digits and attempts to count the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not align with the intended calculation of the penalty.

To illustrate, consider the following test case from the example:

```
Input:
5
1
+
5
-----
6
+-+-
10
--+++++++-
20
+---++++-+++++---
```

The expected output is:

```
1
5
0
4
4
```

However, the provided program will produce incorrect results because it does not correctly interpret the string as a sequence of +1 and -1 values and does not perform the necessary calculations to find the minimum penalty. For instance, for the input `-----` (length 5), the program would incorrectly output 5 instead of the correct output of 5, as the optimal split would be `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])`, resulting in a penalty of 5.
