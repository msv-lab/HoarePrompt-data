Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `val_b` which is being iterated over in `main_ar`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `main_ar`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **`main_ar`**: Since the loop is iterating over `main_ar`, and it is mentioned that `main_ar` must contain at least one element and will have one less element than before each iteration, `main_ar` will have one less element at the start of the next iteration.
   - **`val_b`**: The value of `val_b` changes with each iteration, but the specific value is not relevant for the state adjustment since we are focusing on the loop head variables.

4. **Postcondition Consideration**: The postcondition mentions that if `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is updated. However, this does not affect the state adjustment for the loop itself; it affects the value of `sub_summ` inside the loop.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `sub_sum` remains unchanged for the state adjustment since it is modified inside the loop based on the condition.
   - `sec_arr` and `val_a` remain unchanged for the state adjustment since they are not part of the loop head.
   - `main_ar` will have one less element at the start of the next iteration.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`sub_sum` is the sum of all `val_a[0]` values in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` must contain at least one element and will have one less element than before.**

So, the final state is:

State: **`sub_sum` is the sum of all `val_a[0]` values in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` must contain at least one element and will have one less element than before.**
