Output State: **`b` is a list with an additional element 0, `c` remains unchanged, `d` is the sorted version of `c`, and `n` is the length of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `b`. The lists `c` and `d` remain unchanged because no operations were performed on them. The variable `n` also remains unchanged as it holds the length of `c`, which was not modified.
