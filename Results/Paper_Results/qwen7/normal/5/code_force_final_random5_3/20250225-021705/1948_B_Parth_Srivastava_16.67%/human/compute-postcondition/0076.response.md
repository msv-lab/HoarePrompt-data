Output State: **`a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is an integer equal to `a[1]` divided by 10, `c` is a list containing the value of `y`, and `c` has appended the value of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`. The value of `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, and `y` is the integer quotient of `a[1]` divided by 10. The list `c` originally contains the value of `y`. After appending `x`, `c` now contains both `y` and `x`.
