Output State: **`len(a)` is at least 1, the first element of `a` is not 0, there exists an index `i` greater than 0 such that the element at index `i` in `a` is greater than 10, and the current value of `i` is greater than 0; `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`; `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10.**

Explanation: The code divides the element at index `i` in `a` by 10 and assigns the integer part of the result to `y`. Since the element at index `i` is greater than 10, the integer part of its division by 10 will be an integer. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
