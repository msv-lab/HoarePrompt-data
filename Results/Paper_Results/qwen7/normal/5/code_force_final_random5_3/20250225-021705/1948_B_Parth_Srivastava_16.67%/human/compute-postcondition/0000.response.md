Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `k = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code.
