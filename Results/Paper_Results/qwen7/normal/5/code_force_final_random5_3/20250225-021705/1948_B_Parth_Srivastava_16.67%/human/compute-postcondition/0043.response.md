Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least one element, `i` is a non-negative integer, `n` is incremented by 1, and `c` contains either the last digit of `a[0]` with `n` being `n + 2` if `i` is 0, `a[i]` is greater than 10, and the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10 is less than or equal to the last digit of `a[0]`, or it contains `a[i]` with `n` being 1 if `i` is 0, `a[i]` is greater than 10, and the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10 is greater than the last digit of `a[0]`, or it contains the value of `a[i]` with `n` being `n + 1` if `i` is not 0 or `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10.
