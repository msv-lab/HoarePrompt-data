Output State: **`a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is an integer equal to `a[1]` divided by 10, `c` is a list with one more element which is `a[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `c`. Given that `i` is 1 initially, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. Therefore, `a[1]` is appended to `c`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
