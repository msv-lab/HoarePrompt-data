Postcondition: `len(a)` is at least 1, the first element of `a` is not 0, there exists an index `i` greater than 0 such that the element at index `i` in `a` is greater than 10 and the current value of `i` is greater than 0; `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`; `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10. Additionally, `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`, and either `y` is less than `x` and `n` is incremented by 1, or `y` is less than or equal to `x` and `n` is `n + 2`, or `c` now contains the value of `x`.
