Output State: **`n` is `n + 1`, `c` contains the value of `a[i]`, `len(a)` must be at least 1, `i` is a non-negative integer, and either `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is greater than 0.**

The value of `n` is incremented by 1, while the values of `c`, `len(a)`, `i`, and the condition regarding `a[i]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
