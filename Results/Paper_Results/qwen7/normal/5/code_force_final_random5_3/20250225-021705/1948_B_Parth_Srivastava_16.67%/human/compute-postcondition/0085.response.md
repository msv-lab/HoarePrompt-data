Output State: **`a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is an integer equal to `a[1]` divided by 10.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i]` divided by 10 to `y`. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`. The value of `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, which remains unchanged. The value of `y` is the integer division result of `a[1]` by 10. All other variables remain in their initial or previously calculated states.
