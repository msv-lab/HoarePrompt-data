Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `c` is a list containing elements from `a` plus an additional element `x`, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer value of `a[i]` divided by 10, `n` is incremented by 1 or `n + 2` depending on the conditions inside the loop.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(x)` adds the last digit of `a[i]` (which is stored in `x`) to the list `c`. The other variables (`y`, `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
