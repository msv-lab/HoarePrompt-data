Output State: **`a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is now 1, `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i] % 10` to `x`. Since `i` is now 1, `x` becomes the integer remainder when the first element of `a` is divided by 10. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
