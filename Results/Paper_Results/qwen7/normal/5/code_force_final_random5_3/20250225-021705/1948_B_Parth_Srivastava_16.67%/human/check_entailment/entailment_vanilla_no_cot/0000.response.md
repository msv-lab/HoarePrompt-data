Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Initialization of `b` List**: The list `b` is not initialized before use. This should be done within the loop that processes each test case.
2. **Reading Input**: The function `func_1()` is called without any parameters, but it expects input values. The input reading logic inside `func_1()` is also incorrect. Specifically, the line `a = input()` reads a string, but it should read an integer value for `k` and a space-separated list of integers for `a`.
3. **Logic for Splitting Digits**: The logic for splitting digits and checking if the array can be sorted is mostly correct, but there are some edge cases and simplifications that could be improved.
4. **Output Logic**: The output logic is incorrect. It checks the `b` list after processing all test cases, but it should check and print the result for each test case individually.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
m = int(input())
b = []

for i in range(m):
    k = int(input())  # Read the length of the array
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the array elements
    c = []
    for num in a:
        if num > 10:
            digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
            c.extend(digits)
        else:
            c.append(num)
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)

for res in b:
    if res == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version initializes the `b` list properly, reads the input correctly, and checks and prints the result for each test case individually.
