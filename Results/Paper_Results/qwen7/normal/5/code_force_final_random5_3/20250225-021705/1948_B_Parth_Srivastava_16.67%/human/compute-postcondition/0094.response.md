Output State: **`a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, `c` contains the element `a[1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is incremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was previously to `n + 1`. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `n`, we only know that `n` has been incremented by 1. The variables `a`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `i` is updated to 2 (since it was initially 1 and no operation changed it), and `c` still contains the element `a[1]`.
