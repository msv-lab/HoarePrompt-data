Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases \( m \).
2. For each test case, it calls `func_1()` but does not actually process the test case data.
3. The function `func_1()` processes the input for a single test case, splits the numbers into their individual digits if necessary, and checks if the resulting list is sorted.
4. The function appends 1 to the list `b` if the list is sorted, otherwise, it appends 0.
5. After processing all test cases, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.

However, the main issue is that the program does not process the test cases correctly. It calls `func_1()` without using its results and instead just prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on an empty list `b`. This means the program will always output 'NO', regardless of the actual input, because `b` is never populated with the correct values from `func_1()`.

Given this, the program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
