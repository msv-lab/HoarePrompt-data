Output State: **`len(a)` is at least 1, the first element of `a` is not 0, there exists an index `i` greater than 0 such that the element at index `i` in `a` is greater than 10, and the current value of `i` is greater than 0; `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(a[i] % 10)` calculates the last digit of the element at index `i` in list `a` and assigns it to variable `x`. Since `a[i]` is greater than 10, `a[i] % 10` gives the last digit of `a[i]`, which is then converted to an integer and assigned to `x`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
