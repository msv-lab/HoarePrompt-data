Output State: **`a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is now 1, `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(a[i] % 10)` assigns the value of the last digit of `a[1]` (i.e., `a[i] % 10`) to `x`. Since `i` is now 1, `x` will be the last digit of the element at index 1 in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
