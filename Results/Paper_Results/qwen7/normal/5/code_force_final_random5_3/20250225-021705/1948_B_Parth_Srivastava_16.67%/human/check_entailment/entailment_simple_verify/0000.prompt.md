You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

    #State: Output State: The list `a` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution. The list `c` contains elements from `a` based on the conditions specified within the loop. The variable `n` is the length of `c` after all iterations. If any element `a[i]` in `a` is greater than 10 and `i > 0`, `c` will include the last digit of `a[i]` and the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, with `n` incremented by 1 or 2 based on whether the integer part is less than or equal to the last digit. If `i == 0` and `a[i] > 10`, `c` will include the last digit and the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10, with `n` incremented by 1 or 2 based on the same condition. For all other elements in `a`, `c` simply appends them, incrementing `n` by 1.
    #
    #In summary, `c` will contain a sequence of elements derived from `a` according to the specified rules, and `n` will be the total count of these elements in `c`.
    d = sorted(c)
    if (c == d) :
        b.append(1)
    else :
        b.append(0)
    #State: `c` remains unchanged, `d` is the sorted version of `c`, `n` is the length of `c`, and if `c` is already sorted, `b` contains the element 1. Otherwise, `b` is a list with an additional element 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether an array can be sorted using the specified operation. Here are some key problems:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input**: The program reads the entire input into a list `b` but does not use this list. Instead, it processes each test case inside the `func_1` function and appends a result to `b`. However, `b` is never used after initialization, and the results are printed directly without being stored.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits**: The logic for splitting digits and checking if the array can be sorted is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the new elements (digits) need to be inserted back into the array in the correct positions to ensure the array remains sorted.

3. **Missing Sorting Check**: After processing the array, the program checks if the modified array `c` is sorted. However, this check alone is not sufficient. The program needs to ensure that the array can be transformed into a sorted array through the specified operations, not just that the final state is sorted.

4. **Incorrect Use of Variables**: The variables `x`, `y`, and `n` are used in a way that does not correctly track the state of the array during the transformation process. This makes it difficult to determine if the array can be sorted.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following input:

```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

- For the first test case `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program should correctly determine that it can be sorted to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
- For the second test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program incorrectly prints 'YES' because it does not correctly handle the insertion of digits to maintain the sorted order.
- For the third test case `[0, 0]`, the program correctly prints 'YES'.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
