Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `c` is a list containing elements from `a`, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `x = int(a[i] % 10)` calculates the last digit of the element at index `i` in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `x`. The variables `a` and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` is not affected by this line of code.
