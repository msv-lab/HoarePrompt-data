Output State: **The list `c` remains unchanged, `d` is the sorted version of `c`, and `n` is the length of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `d = sorted(c)` sorts the list `c` and assigns the sorted list to `d`. The list `c` itself does not change; only `d` gets updated to the sorted version of `c`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as the sorting operation does not affect its value. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged list `c`, the newly created sorted list `d`, and the unchanged value of `n`.
