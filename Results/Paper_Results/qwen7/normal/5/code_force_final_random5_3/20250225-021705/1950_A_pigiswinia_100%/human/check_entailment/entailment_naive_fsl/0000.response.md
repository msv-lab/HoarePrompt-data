Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal (i.e., `a == b == c`). According to the problem description, such a case should be classified as "NONE". However, the current implementation will incorrectly classify `0 0 0` as "STAIR" or "PEAK" depending on the order of comparison, which is not correct. For example:

- Input: `0 0 0`
- Expected Output: `NONE`
- Program Output: `STAIR` or `PEAK` (depending on the order of comparison)

To fix this, the conditions should be checked in a way that ensures equality is handled correctly. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This version explicitly checks for the case where `a == b == c` and prints "NONE" in that case, ensuring the program works correctly for all potential inputs.
