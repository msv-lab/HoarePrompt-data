Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and `t` is now the integer input from the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning this new value to `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, after executing the code, `t` will still satisfy this condition, but its specific value will be the one entered by the user.
