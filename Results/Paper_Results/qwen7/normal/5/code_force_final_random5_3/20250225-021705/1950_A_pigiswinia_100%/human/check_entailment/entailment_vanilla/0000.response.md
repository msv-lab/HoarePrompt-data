Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'NONE'.

3. **Conditions for Stair and Peak:**
   - A stair is defined as `a < b < c`.
   - A peak is defined as `a < b > c`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the specified range (0 to 9).
   - It correctly identifies when the numbers form a stair, a peak, or neither.

### Testing the Conditions:
- **Stair Condition (`a < b < c`):**
  - Example: `1 2 3` should print 'STAIR'.
  - Example: `1 5 3` should not print 'STAIR' because `5 > 3`.

- **Peak Condition (`a < b > c`):**
  - Example: `3 2 1` should print 'PEAK'.
  - Example: `3 4 1` should print 'PEAK'.
  - Example: `4 1 7` should not print 'PEAK' because `1 < 7`.

- **Neither Condition:**
  - Examples like `3 2 2`, `1 1 1`, etc., should print 'NONE'.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all the edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
