Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(t > 2\), `i` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces. Since the if condition `a < b > c` does not change the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
