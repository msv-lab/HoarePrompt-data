Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key's value is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of that key in the original list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty since one element is processed in each iteration. The dictionary `cnt` will contain the count of each unique integer present in the original list `a`, with each count incremented by 1 for every occurrence of that integer in the list.
Code of the loop:
for x in cnt.values():
    ans += x // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is 0 + x // 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary that must contain at least one non-zero value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is 0 + next_x // 3 + x // 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary that must contain at least one non-zero value

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is 0 + next_x // 3 + x // 3 + x // 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary that must contain at least one non-zero value, `x` is the next value from `cnt.values()`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
