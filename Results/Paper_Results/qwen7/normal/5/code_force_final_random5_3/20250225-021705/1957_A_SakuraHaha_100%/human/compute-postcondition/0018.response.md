Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt.values()` by 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary where each value represents the count of each unique integer in the original list `a` (each count incremented by 1 for every occurrence of that integer in the list).**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have been executed, the list `a` will be empty because one element is processed in each iteration. The dictionary `cnt` will contain the count of each unique integer present in the original list `a`, with each count incremented by 1 for every occurrence of that integer in the list. The variable `ans` will be the sum of each value in `cnt.values()` divided by 3.
