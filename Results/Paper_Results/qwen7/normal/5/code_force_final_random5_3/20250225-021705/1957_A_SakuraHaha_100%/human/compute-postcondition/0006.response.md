Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is 0
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers
   - `cnt` is a dictionary with each key's value incremented by 1 if the key exists, otherwise initialized to 1

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The variable `x` is the current element being processed in the list `a`.
   - After processing each element `x`, the loop moves to the next element in the list `a`.

5. **Determine the Next Element**:
   - Since `a` is a non-empty list, there will be at least one element left to process.
   - Let's assume the current element `x` was the last element in the list `a` before the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the list.

6. **Update the States**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `a` will now be the list without the first element (the one that was just processed).
   - `cnt` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `x` will be the next element in the list `a`.
- `a` will be the list `a` without the first element.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can denote it as the next element in the list `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (with the first element removed), `cnt` is a dictionary with each key's value incremented by 1 if the key exists, otherwise initialized to 1**.
