Reasoning:
- The provided program is designed to handle multiple test cases, which aligns with the problem statement.
- For each test case, it correctly reads the number of sticks `n`, the lengths of the sticks, and then counts the occurrences of each unique stick length using a dictionary.
- It calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by taking the floor division of each count by 3 (since a triangle is the smallest regular polygon and has 3 sides).
- However, there is a critical issue: the function `func_1()` is called with `t=1` before the loop that processes the test cases. This means that `func_1()` is executed once before the actual test cases start, which is not intended according to the problem description.

Despite this initialization issue, the logic within `func_1()` itself is correct for processing each test case after the initialization. The program will still produce the correct output for each test case after the initial incorrect call to `func_1()`. 

Given that the problem description specifies handling multiple test cases and the program correctly processes them after the initial incorrect call, the core functionality is sound.

Correctness: **True**
