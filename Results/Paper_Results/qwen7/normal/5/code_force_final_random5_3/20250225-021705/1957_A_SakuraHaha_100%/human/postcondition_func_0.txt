The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). It counts the occurrences of each unique integer in the list `a` and calculates the sum of the floor division of each count by 3. Finally, it prints the calculated sum.
