To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression being evaluated:

1. **`ans`**: This is defined as the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt.values()` by 3. Since `cnt` is a dictionary representing the count of each unique integer in the list `a`, and each count is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of that integer, the values in `cnt` represent the frequency of each integer in the list `a`.

2. **`cnt.values()`**: This returns the values of the dictionary `cnt`, which are the counts of each unique integer in the list `a`.

3. **Floor Division (`// 3`)**: For each value in `cnt.values()`, this operation divides the value by 3 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.

4. **Summing the Results**: The `ans` variable is the sum of these floor division results.

Given that `cnt` is a dictionary with values representing the counts of each unique integer in the list `a`, and since the exact contents of `a` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the floor division of each value in cnt.values() by 3)**
