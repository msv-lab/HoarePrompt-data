Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the splitting of digits from elements that are at least 10 properly. Instead, it uses a function `func_1` which checks if the list is sorted, but it does not perform the necessary operations to split and reinsert the digits.

Here is an example where the program fails:
Consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
```
The expected output should be "YES" because we can split the elements as follows:
- Split 12 into [1, 2]
- Split 45 into [4, 5]
- Split 67 into [6, 7]

So the final array would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], which is sorted.

However, the provided program does not perform these splits. It simply checks if the list is sorted after performing some operations, which is not sufficient. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required logic and thus is incorrect.
