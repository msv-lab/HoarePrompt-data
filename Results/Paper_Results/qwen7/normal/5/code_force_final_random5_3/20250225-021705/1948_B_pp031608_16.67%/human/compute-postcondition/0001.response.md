Output State: **The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**

This means the program checks if the list `lst` is already sorted (i.e., `lst` is equal to its sorted version `sorted_lst`). If `lst` is sorted, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
