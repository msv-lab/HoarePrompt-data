Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50; `sorted_lst` is a sorted version of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `lst` and assigns the sorted list to `sorted_lst`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged in terms of its content and length, but it is now referenced by two names: `lst` and `sorted_lst`. The values within `lst` are rearranged in ascending order in `sorted_lst`.
