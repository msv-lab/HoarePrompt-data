Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `c` is an input integer.
- The condition `a >= b` or `b >= c` holds true.
- `a != b` or `b != c`.
- The maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is equal to `b`.

The print statement is simply `print('PEAK')`.

Since the print statement is printing a string literal `'PEAK'`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **PEAK**
