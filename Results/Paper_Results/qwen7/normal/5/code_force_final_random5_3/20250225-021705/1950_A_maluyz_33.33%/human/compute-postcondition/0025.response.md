Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer. The maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is assigned to a variable (either `b` if the condition is met or the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` if the condition is not met).**
