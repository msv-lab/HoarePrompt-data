Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the conditions used to determine if the digits form a peak. Specifically, the condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` is not sufficient to correctly identify all peak cases. The condition should check if `a < b > c` instead of just `b` being the maximum value. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly identifies both stair and peak cases.
