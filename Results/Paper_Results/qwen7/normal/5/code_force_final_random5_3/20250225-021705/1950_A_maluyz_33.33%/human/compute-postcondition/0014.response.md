Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the condition `a >= b` or `b >= c` holds true. Additionally, the value of `max(a, b, c)` is either equal to `b` or not equal to `b`, depending on whether the if condition is met or not.
