Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is the first input integer.
   - `b` is the second input integer.
   - `c` is the third input integer.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `t` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer**
