You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be exactly equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is now `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last set of integers input by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split. Depending on the conditions met in the loop, the output printed during each iteration will be either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. After all iterations, the loop will have processed `t` sets of inputs, and the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will reflect the most recent input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes three integers a, b, and c within the range 0 to 9, and an integer t within the range 1 to 1000, and returns a value based on specific conditions.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
