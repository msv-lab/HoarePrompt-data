Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `c` is an input integer.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and the loop condition is `i < t`, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.

5. **Maintain the State of Other Variables**: The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change within the loop head. They are only modified within the loop body, but we are not given any information about their modifications in this context.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `t` remains the same (greater than 0).
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**.
