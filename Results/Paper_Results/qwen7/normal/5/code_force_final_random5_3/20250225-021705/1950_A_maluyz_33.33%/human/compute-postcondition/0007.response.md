Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `c` is an input integer.
- The condition `a >= b` or `b >= c` holds true.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal.

The print statement is:

```python
print('NONE')
```

Given that the condition `a >= b` or `b >= c` holds true and `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, this condition is inherently satisfied because if `a == b == c`, then both `a >= b` and `b >= c` are true.

Therefore, the print statement will simply output the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **'NONE'**
