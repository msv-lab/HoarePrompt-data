Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer obtained from the second line of input split and converted to integer, `k` is an integer obtained from the second line of input split and converted to integer, `s` is the next line of input.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts because neither part modifies the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `s`. Therefore, regardless of whether the condition `k >= 2` is true or false, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
