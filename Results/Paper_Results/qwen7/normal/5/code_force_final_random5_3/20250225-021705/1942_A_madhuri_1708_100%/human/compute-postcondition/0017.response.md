Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the integer obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to integer.
- `k` is the integer obtained from the same line after splitting and converting to integer.
- If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then either `k` equals `n` or `n` does not equal `k`.
- If `k` is less than 2, then `k` remains less than 2.

### Loop Statement
```python
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over each line of the input starting from the third line (since `[*open(0)][1:]` skips the first two lines).
- The variable `s` represents each line of input starting from the third line.

### States to Adjust
- Since the loop iterates over each line of input, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the current line being processed (`s`).

### Updated State
- After processing the current line `s`, the next line will be read.
- Therefore, `s` will be updated to the next line of input.

### New State
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to integer, `k` is the integer obtained from the same line after splitting and converting to integer, and `s` is the third line of input.**

However, since `s` is the line being processed, it will be updated to the next line in the subsequent iteration. For clarity, we can rephrase this as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to integer, `k` is the integer obtained from the same line after splitting and converting to integer, and `s` is the next line of input.**
