Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to integer, `k` is the integer obtained from the same line after splitting and converting to integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, s.split())` takes the second line of input (after slicing the initial `t` lines), splits it into two parts based on whitespace, and converts these parts into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it within this code snippet.
