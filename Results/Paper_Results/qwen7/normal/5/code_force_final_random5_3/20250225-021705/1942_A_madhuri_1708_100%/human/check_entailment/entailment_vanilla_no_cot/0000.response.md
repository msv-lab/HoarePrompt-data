Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here’s why:

1. **Case Analysis for `k >= 2`:**
   - The logic checks if `k >= 2` and then further checks if `n == k`. If `n == k`, it prints a sequence where all elements are equal to `k`. This works for some cases but fails for others.
   - For example, for input `3 2`, the expected output is `-1` because it's impossible to have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts for an array of length 3 with distinct values. However, the current implementation would incorrectly print `[2, 2, 2]`.

2. **Handling Other Cases:**
   - The logic for `k < 2` simply prints an increasing sequence from 1 to `n`. This does not cover all possible valid arrays for different values of `n` and `k`.
   - For instance, for `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the output should be an array where only one cyclic shift is sorted. The current implementation will generate an array like `[1, 2, 3]` where all cyclic shifts are sorted, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the properties of cyclic shifts and how to construct an array that meets the criteria. Here’s a revised approach:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k == 1:
            # Generate an array where only one cyclic shift is sorted
            if n == 1:
                print(1)
            elif n == 2:
                print(-1)
            else:
                print(*[i for i in range(1, n)], *[n])
        elif k == n:
            # All cyclic shifts are sorted
            print(*[i for i in range(1, n + 1)])
        else:
            # Impossible to have exactly k sorted cyclic shifts
            print(-1)

func()
```

This solution handles the edge cases more appropriately and ensures that the generated array meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.
