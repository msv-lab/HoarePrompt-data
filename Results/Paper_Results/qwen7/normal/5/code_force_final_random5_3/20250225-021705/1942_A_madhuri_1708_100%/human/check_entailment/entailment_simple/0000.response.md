Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the case when `k >= 2` and `n == k`. It prints an array where the first `k` elements are `k`, which ensures that all `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. When `k >= 2` but `n != k`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for `n > k`.
3. For the case when `k == 1`, the program prints an array where each element is its index plus one (`j + 1`). This ensures that only the original array (first cyclic shift) is sorted, as required.

Given these observations, the program correctly implements the logic for all described scenarios based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
