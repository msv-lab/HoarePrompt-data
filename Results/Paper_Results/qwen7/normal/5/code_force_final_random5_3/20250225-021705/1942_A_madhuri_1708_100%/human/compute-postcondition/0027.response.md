Output: **-1**

Explanation: The initial state describes that `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). The variables `n` and `k` are obtained from splitting the second line of input and converting them to integers, and `s` is the next line of input. However, the print statement simply outputs `-1` without relying on the values of `n`, `k`, or `s`. Therefore, regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, or `s`, the output will always be `-1`.
