Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the second line of input split and converted to integer.
- `k` is an integer obtained from the second line of input split and converted to integer.
- `s` is the next line of input.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(*[k for j in range(k)])
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The expression `[k for j in range(k)]` generates a list with `k` occurrences of the value `k`.
2. The `*` operator is used to unpack this list into separate arguments for the `print` function.
3. Therefore, the `print` function will print `k` copies of the value `k`.

Given the initial state, the value of `k` is determined by the second line of input split and converted to an integer. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the input.

Output: **k k ... k (k times)**
