Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is the integer obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to integer.
   - `k` is the integer obtained from the same line after splitting and converting to integer.
   - `s` is the next line of input.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*[k for j in range(k)])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The expression `[k for j in range(k)]` creates a list comprehension that generates a list of `k` elements, where each element is the integer `k`.
   - The `*` operator in the `print` function is used to unpack the list, so the `print` function will print the elements of the list separated by spaces.

Given the initial state, we know that `k` is an integer obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to an integer. Let's denote this integer as `k_value`.

Therefore, the list comprehension `[k for j in range(k)]` will generate a list with `k_value` elements, each being `k_value`. When this list is printed using the `print(*...)` syntax, it will print these elements separated by spaces.

Output: **k_value k_value ... k_value (k_value times)**
