Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `a` is `int(a)`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(a)` converts the value of `a` to an integer and assigns it back to `a`. However, since the initial value of `a` is given as `int(a)`, this operation does not change the value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
