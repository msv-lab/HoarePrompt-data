Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are digits.**

Explanation: The loop processes each character of the `password` string exactly once. After all iterations, `password` becomes an empty string because all its characters have been processed and removed (or moved to `letters` or `digits`). The `letters` list contains all characters from the original `password` that are not digits, and the `digits` list contains all characters from the original `password` that are digits.
