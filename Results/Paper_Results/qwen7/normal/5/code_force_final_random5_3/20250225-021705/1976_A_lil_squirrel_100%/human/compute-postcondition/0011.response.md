Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ch in password:`. The only variable being iterated over here is `ch`, which represents each character in the `password`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).
   - `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - `letters` is a list containing characters from the password that are not digits.
   - `digits` is a list containing characters from the password that are digits.

3. **Understand what happens in each iteration**:
   - In each iteration, the loop processes one character from the `password` string, assigning it to `ch`.
   - The lists `letters` and `digits` are updated based on the value of `ch`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `ch` is a character from the `password`, at the start of the next iteration, `ch` will be the next character in the `password`.
   - The lists `letters` and `digits` will be updated accordingly, but their overall properties (lengths, contents) will change based on the new character.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `password` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `letters` and `digits` will contain one more character each compared to the previous iteration, but the exact contents depend on the next character in the `password`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `n` remains the same.
- `password` remains the same.
- `letters` and `digits` will contain one more character each, but we cannot specify exactly what those characters are without knowing the next character in the `password`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing characters from the password that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing characters from the password that are digits.**
