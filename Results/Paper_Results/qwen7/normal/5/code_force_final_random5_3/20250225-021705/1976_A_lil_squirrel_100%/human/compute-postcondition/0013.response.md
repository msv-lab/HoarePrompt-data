Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing characters from the password that are not digits, `digits` is a list containing characters from the password that are digits, `ch` is appended to the `letters` list.**

Explanation: The code `letters.append(ch)` appends the character `ch` to the list `letters`. Since `ch` is a character from the password that is not a digit (as per the precondition), it is added to the `letters` list. The other variables remain unchanged according to their preconditions.
