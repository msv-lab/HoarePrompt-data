Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 19\), `password` is a string of length \(n-1\) consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing characters from the password that are not digits, `digits` is a list containing characters from the password that are digits, and `ch` is the first character of the remaining `password` string, `letters` now includes the first character of the remaining `password` string.**

Explanation: The code `letters.append(ch)` appends the first character of the remaining `password` string to the list `letters`. The values of `n`, `password`, `digits`, and `ch` remain unchanged.
