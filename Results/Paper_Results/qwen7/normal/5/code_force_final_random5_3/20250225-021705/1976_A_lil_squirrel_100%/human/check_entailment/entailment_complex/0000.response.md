Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly separates the characters into `letters` and `digits`.
2. It checks if the `letters` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. It checks if the `digits` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. It iterates through the `password` to ensure there are no instances where a letter is followed by a digit.
5. The logic flow is correct and aligns with the problem statement.
6. The function returns 'YES' only if all conditions are met, and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the annotated program and the reasoning above, the function correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
