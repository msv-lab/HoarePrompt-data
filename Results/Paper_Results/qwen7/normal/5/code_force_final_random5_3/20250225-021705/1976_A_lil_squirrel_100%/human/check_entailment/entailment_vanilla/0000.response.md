Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Password Parsing**: The program correctly separates the characters into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.
3. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if both `letters` and `digits` are sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function. If either list is not sorted, it returns "NO".
4. **Character Order Check**: The program iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. This check ensures that the password meets the requirement that after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends.
5. **Output**: If all checks pass, the program returns "YES".

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program logic appears to be correct and should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
