### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part of the assessment is accurate.
2. **Password Parsing**: The program correctly separates the characters into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits. This part of the assessment is also accurate.
3. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if both `letters` and `digits` are sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function. If either list is not sorted, it returns "NO". This part of the assessment is accurate.
4. **Character Order Check**: The program iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. This check ensures that the password meets the requirement that after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends. However, there is a subtle issue here. The current implementation only checks if a digit immediately follows a letter, but it does not account for the possibility of multiple letters followed by a digit. For example, the password "a1b2" would incorrectly pass the check because the digit '1' does not follow a letter directly. To fix this, the check should ensure that no digit is found after any letter until the end of the string. This can be done by ensuring that if a letter is found, all subsequent characters must be letters until the end of the string.
5. **Output**: If all checks pass, the program returns "YES". This part of the assessment is accurate.

Given the above points, the original assessment is mostly accurate, but there is a small flaw in the character order check. The current implementation only checks for immediate digit-following-letter, but it should ensure that no digit is found after any letter until the end of the string.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program needs to be modified to correctly handle cases where a digit might appear after a sequence of letters. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    i = 0
    while i < len(password) and password[i].isalpha():
        i += 1
    if i < len(password) and password[i].isdigit():
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This corrected version ensures that no digit is found after any letter until the end of the string.
