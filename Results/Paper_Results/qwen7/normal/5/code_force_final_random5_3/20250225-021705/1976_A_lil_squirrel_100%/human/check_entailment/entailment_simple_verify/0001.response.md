### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **Password Parsing**: The program correctly separates the characters into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits. This part is also correct.
3. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if both `letters` and `digits` are sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function. However, there is a flaw in this step. The `sorted()` function sorts the lists alphabetically and numerically, which means that if the original order of the digits or letters does not match the sorted order, the check will fail even if the digits or letters are already sorted. For example, if the password is "123", the `sorted()` function will sort it as "123", but if the password is "321", the `sorted()` function will return "123", causing the check to fail. Therefore, the sorting check is incorrect because it does not account for the original order of the digits and letters.
4. **Character Order Check**: The program iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. This check ensures that the password meets the requirement that after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends. This part is correct.
5. **Output**: If all checks pass, the program returns "YES". However, due to the flaw in the sorting check, the program may incorrectly return "NO" for some valid passwords.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the flaw in the sorting check, the program does not correctly verify the passwords according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

**Final: False**
