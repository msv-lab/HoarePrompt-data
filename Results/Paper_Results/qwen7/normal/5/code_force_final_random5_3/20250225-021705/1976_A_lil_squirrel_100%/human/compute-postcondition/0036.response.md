Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(password) - 2` (since it checks up to `len(password) - 1`).

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `password` is a non-empty string.
   - For all indices `i` in the string, either the character at index `i` is not alphabetic or the character at index `i + 1` is not a digit.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` from the previous value.

5. **Check the New Value of `i`**:
   - If the previous value of `i` was `k`, then the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < len(password) - 1`.

6. **Ensure the Condition Holds**:
   - The condition `i < len(password) - 1` must hold true for the loop to continue.
   - If `i` reaches `len(password) - 1`, the loop will terminate.

Given these points, let's adjust the state:

- If the previous value of `i` was `k`, then the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i < len(password) - 1`.

Since the exact previous value of `i` is not specified, we can denote it as `k`. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.

**State:**
State: **`password` is a non-empty string, and for all indices `i` in the string, either the character at index `i` is not alphabetic or the character at index `i + 1` is not a digit. If the character at index `i` is alphabetic and the character at index `i + 1` is a digit, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything. `i` is k + 1, where k is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**
