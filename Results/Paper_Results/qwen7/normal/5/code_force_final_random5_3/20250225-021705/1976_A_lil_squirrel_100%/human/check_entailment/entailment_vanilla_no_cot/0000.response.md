Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as specified in the problem description. It checks the following:

1. The password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. There is no digit that comes after a letter.

The function `func_1` processes the password character by character, separating letters and digits into two lists. It then checks if both lists are sorted and ensures that no digit follows a letter. If any of these conditions fail, it returns "NO"; otherwise, it returns "YES". The main loop correctly calls this function for each test case.
