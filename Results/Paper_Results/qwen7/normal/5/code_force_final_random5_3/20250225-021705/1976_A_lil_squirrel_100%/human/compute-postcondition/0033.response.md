Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(password) - 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(password) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `password` is a non-empty string.
   - For all indices `i` in the string, either the character at index `i` is not alphabetic or the character at index `i + 1` is not a digit.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was some value `k` (where `k < len(password) - 1`).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `k + 1`.
   - Since `i` is now `k + 1`, the new condition for the loop to continue is that `k + 1 < len(password) - 1`, which means `i` must still be less than `len(password) - 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `password` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `k + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `len(password) - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`password` is a non-empty string, and for all indices `i` in the string, either the character at index `i` is not alphabetic or the character at index `i + 1` is not a digit, `i` is `k + 1`, where `k + 1 < len(password) - 1`**.
