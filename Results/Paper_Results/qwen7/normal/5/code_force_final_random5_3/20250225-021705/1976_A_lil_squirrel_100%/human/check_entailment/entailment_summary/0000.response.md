Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password meets the specified conditions. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case.
2. **Password Validation**:
   - It separates the password into two lists: one for letters and one for digits.
   - It checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It ensures that no digit appears immediately after a letter.
3. **Returning Results**: Based on the above checks, it prints 'YES' if the password is strong, otherwise 'NO'.

Given the execution summary, the program correctly handles all the specified conditions:
- It checks if the letters are sorted.
- It checks if the digits are sorted.
- It ensures no digit follows a letter.

Since the provided code accurately implements the required functionality, the correctness of the program is verified.

Correctness: **True**
