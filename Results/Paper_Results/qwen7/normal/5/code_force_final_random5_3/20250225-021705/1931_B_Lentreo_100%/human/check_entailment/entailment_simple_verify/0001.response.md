### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index must be less than the destination container index.
2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, meaning the average amount of water per container is an integer. If we can achieve this average in every container, the answer is "YES". Otherwise, it's "NO".
3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container stored in `nums`.
   - It then calls `func_1(nums)` to check if it's possible to equalize the water in all containers.
4. **Function `func_1(nums)`**:
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns "NO".
   - It calculates the target amount of water per container (`mean`).
   - It iterates through the containers, maintaining a running difference between the current total and the target total. If at any point the running difference goes negative, it means it's impossible to reach the target distribution, so it returns "NO".
   - If the loop completes without returning "NO", it means it's possible to equalize the water, so it returns "YES".

The original assessment correctly identifies the key insights and the logic of the program. However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation that needs to be addressed.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Total Water Check**: The program correctly checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. This ensures that the average amount of water per container is an integer.
- **Running Difference Calculation**: The program maintains a running difference `curr` between the current total and the target total. If `curr` ever becomes negative, it implies that it's impossible to reach the target distribution, and the function returns "NO".
- **Final Return Statement**: The original assessment states that if the loop completes without returning "NO", it means it's possible to equalize the water, so it returns "YES". However, this is not entirely accurate.

### Issue with the Final Return Statement:

The final return statement in the function should not be "YES" if the loop completes without returning "NO". Instead, the function should return "YES" only if the loop completes successfully without encountering a negative `curr` value. The current implementation is correct in this aspect because the loop will only return "YES" if no negative `curr` values are encountered.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and the logic of the program. The implementation correctly handles the problem constraints and ensures that the program behaves as expected.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
