Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `curr` is `nums[0] - mean + nums[2] - mean`.
   - The postcondition checks if `curr` is less than 0, and if so, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, no change is made to the return value.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `range(n)`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `curr` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body (as per the given information).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variable that changes is `i`, which will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `curr` remains the same, but since it is not modified, we don't need to explicitly state it changing.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `curr` remains `nums[0] - mean + nums[2] - mean`.
   - The postcondition still applies, but since `curr` is not modified, the return value remains unchanged unless `curr` becomes less than 0 in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `curr` is `nums[0] - mean + nums[2] - mean`**
