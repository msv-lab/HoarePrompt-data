Output State: **`n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is `total // n`, `curr` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `curr` to 0. The values of `n`, `total`, and `mean` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `n` is still the length of `nums`, `total` is still the sum of the elements in `nums`, and `mean` is still `total // n`.
