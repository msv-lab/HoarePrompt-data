### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index must be less than the destination container index.
2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, meaning the average amount of water per container is an integer. If we can achieve this average in every container, the answer is "YES". Otherwise, it's "NO".
3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container stored in `nums`.
   - It then calls `func_1(nums)` to check if it's possible to equalize the water in all containers.
4. **Function `func_1(nums)`**:
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns "NO".
   - It calculates the target amount of water per container (`mean`).
   - It iterates through the containers, maintaining a running difference between the current total and the target total. If at any point the running difference goes negative, it means it's impossible to reach the target distribution, so it returns "NO".
   - If the loop completes without returning "NO", it means it's possible to equalize the water, so it returns "YES".

The provided annotated code and the original assessment accurately reflect the program's logic and its correctness. The program correctly checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers and ensures that the cumulative difference between the current total and the target total remains non-negative. If the cumulative difference ever becomes negative, it indicates that it is impossible to equalize the water, leading to a "NO" result. If the loop completes without any issues, the program correctly concludes that it is possible to equalize the water, returning "YES".

Given the analysis, the program logic matches the problem requirements and correctly implements the solution.
