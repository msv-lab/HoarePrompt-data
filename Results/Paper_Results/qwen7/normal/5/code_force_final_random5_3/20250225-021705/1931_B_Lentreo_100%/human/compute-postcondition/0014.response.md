Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n)`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `curr` is `nums[0] - mean` and it is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to update the state of `i` to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains as it was before, but since it is not specified, we assume it remains unchanged.
   - The value of `curr` does not change within the loop head, so it remains `nums[0] - mean` and is still greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0**
