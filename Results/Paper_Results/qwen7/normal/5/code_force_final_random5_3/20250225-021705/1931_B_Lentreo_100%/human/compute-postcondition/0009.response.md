Output State: **`i` is 1, `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is updated by adding `nums[i] - mean` to its current value. Initially, `i` is 0, so `nums[i]` refers to `nums[0]`. Since `mean` is not defined in the initial state, it remains as `mean`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `curr` is now `nums[0] - mean`. The length of `nums` (`n`) is unchanged.
