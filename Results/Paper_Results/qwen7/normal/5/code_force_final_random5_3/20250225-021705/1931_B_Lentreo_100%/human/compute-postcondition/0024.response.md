Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n`, `curr` is the sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and `mean` (i.e., `nums[0] - mean + nums[1] - mean + ... + nums[n-1] - mean`), and the function has not returned 'NO'.

In simpler terms, after running through all the iterations of the loop, the variable `curr` will hold the total sum of how much each element in the list `nums` deviates from the mean value of the list. The function does not return 'NO' unless `curr` becomes negative at any point during the loop's execution.
