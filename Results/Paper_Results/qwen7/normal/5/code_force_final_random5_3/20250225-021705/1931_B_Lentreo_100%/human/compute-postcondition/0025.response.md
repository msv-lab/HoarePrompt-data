Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n`, `curr` is the sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and the mean (`total // n`), and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.

In more detail, `i` will be equal to the length of `nums` (denoted as `n`), because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `curr` accumulates the sum of `nums[i] - mean` for each iteration of the loop. If at any point during these iterations, `curr` becomes less than 0, the function would return 'NO' immediately. Since we are considering the state after all iterations, it means that `curr` never became negative, and thus the function would return 'YES' (implied by the absence of a return statement before the end of the loop).
