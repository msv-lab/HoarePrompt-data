Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `node_u` is -1, `node_v` is -1
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)
        if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
            _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
            node_u = u
            node_v = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the first tuple in `edges`. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, then `parent_v` is updated to be the same as `parent_u`, `parent_u` remains unchanged, and if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, then `node_v` is updated to be the value of `v` from the first tuple in `edges`. Otherwise, `parent_v` is updated to be the same as `parent_u`, and `parent_u` is not equal to the original `parent_v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the root nodes of `node_u` and `node_v` in the DSU structure. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `node_v` is updated according to the condition: if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, then `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`; otherwise, `node_v` remains unchanged. `parent_u` and `parent_v` are united under the same root node. If `parent_u` does not equal `parent_v`, `parent_u` is updated to be the same as `parent_v` in the DSU structure.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the root nodes of `node_u` and `node_v` respectively. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the union operation has been performed between `u` and `v` with some weight `w`, and `_min_edge` is updated to be the minimum edge weight among all edges connected to `node_u`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
