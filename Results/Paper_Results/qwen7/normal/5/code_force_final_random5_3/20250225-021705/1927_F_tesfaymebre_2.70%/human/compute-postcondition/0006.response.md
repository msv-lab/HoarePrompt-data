Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_6()` is called, but since no changes are made to any variables within the function call itself, and no return values are specified, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged. The precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 is still valid after the function call.
