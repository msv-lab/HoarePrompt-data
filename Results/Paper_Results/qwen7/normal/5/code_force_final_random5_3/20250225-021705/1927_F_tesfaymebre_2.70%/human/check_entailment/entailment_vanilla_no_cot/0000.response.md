Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge using a greedy approach with a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. However, there are several issues with the implementation that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Use of DSU**: The DSU is used to detect cycles but not to find the minimum-weight cycle directly. The current implementation only merges sets and keeps track of the minimum edge weight within each set. This does not guarantee finding the minimum-weight cycle.

2. **Cycle Detection and Path Reconstruction**: The code uses DFS to reconstruct the path after finding a cycle. However, the logic to ensure the path is a simple cycle and to correctly identify the minimum-weight cycle is flawed. Specifically, the `dfs` function does not properly handle the cycle detection and reconstruction.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The solution assumes that the first cycle found will be the minimum-weight cycle, which is not necessarily true. The algorithm should ensure that the cycle found is indeed the one with the minimum lightest edge weight.

4. **Potential Infinite Loops**: The `dfs` function may lead to infinite loops if not properly handled, especially if the graph has complex structures.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to use a more sophisticated algorithm such as finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and then checking for cycles in the MST. Alternatively, you could use a more robust cycle-finding algorithm that ensures the cycle is simple and has the minimum lightest edge weight.

Here's a high-level outline of a correct approach:
- Find the MST using Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm.
- For each edge in the MST, check if removing it forms a cycle. If so, check if this cycle has the minimum lightest edge weight among all such cycles.

This approach ensures that you correctly identify the minimum-weight simple cycle in the graph.
