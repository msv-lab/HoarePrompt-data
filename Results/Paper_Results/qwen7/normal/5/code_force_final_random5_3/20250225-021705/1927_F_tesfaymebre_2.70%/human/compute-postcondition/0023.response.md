Output State: **The color of the vertex `curr` remains 1, `nei` is the next valid neighbor of `curr` that meets the conditions `colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`, the result `res` of the dfs function call is the return value of `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, and `node_v` is in the set `set_res`.**

Explanation: The code `res = dfs(nei, curr, path)` calls the `dfs` function with the arguments `nei`, `curr`, and `path`, and assigns the return value of this function call to `res`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
