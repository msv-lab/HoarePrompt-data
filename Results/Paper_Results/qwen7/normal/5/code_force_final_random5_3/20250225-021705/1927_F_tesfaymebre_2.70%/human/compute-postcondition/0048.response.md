Output State: **_min_edge is the minimum edge weight among all the edges connected to node_u; `node_u` is now `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`; `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`; `parent_u` is the root node of `node_u` in the DSU structure; `parent_v` is the root node of `node_v` in the DSU structure; `node_v` is updated to the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`; the DSU structure has united `node_u` and `node_v` under the same root node.**

In this output state, the value of `node_v` has been updated to the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
