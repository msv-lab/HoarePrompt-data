Postcondition: **`edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the root nodes of `node_u` and `node_v` in the DSU structure. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `node_v` is updated according to the condition: if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, then `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`; otherwise, `node_v` remains unchanged. `parent_u` and `parent_v` are united under the same root node. If `parent_u` does not equal `parent_v`, `parent_u` is updated to be the same as `parent_v` in the DSU structure.**
