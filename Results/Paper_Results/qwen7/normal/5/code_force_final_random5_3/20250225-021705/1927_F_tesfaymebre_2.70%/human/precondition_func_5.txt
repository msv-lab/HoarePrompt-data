(n, m) is a tuple of two integers where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2 * 10^5), edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v, w) represents an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, and DSU is a data structure representing Disjoint Set Union with additional attributes like `find`, `union`, and `min_edge`.
