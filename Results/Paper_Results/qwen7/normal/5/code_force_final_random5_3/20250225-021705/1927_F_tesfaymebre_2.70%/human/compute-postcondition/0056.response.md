Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is now the root node of `node_u` after union operation, `parent_v` is now the root node of `node_v` after union operation.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` function unites the sets containing `node_u` and `node_v` in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure. This means that `parent_u` and `parent_v` will both point to the same root node after the union operation. The values of `node_u`, `node_v`, and the list `edges` remain unchanged.
