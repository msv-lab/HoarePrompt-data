Postcondition: `edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the first tuple in `edges`. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, then `parent_v` is updated to be the same parent as `node_u`, `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`. Additionally, if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, then `node_v` is updated to be the value of `v` from the first tuple in `edges`. Otherwise, `parent_v` is updated to be the same as `parent_u`, and `parent_u` is not equal to the original `parent_v`.
