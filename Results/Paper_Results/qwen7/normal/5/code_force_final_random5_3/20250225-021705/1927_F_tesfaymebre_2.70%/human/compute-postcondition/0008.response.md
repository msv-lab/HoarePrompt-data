Output State: `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `test_cases` must still be greater than 0. This is because the loop continues to run as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0, and there is no operation within the loop that changes the value of `test_cases`. Therefore, if the loop runs for 1, 2, or 3 times, it implies that `test_cases` was initially greater than 0 and remained so throughout the loop's execution.
