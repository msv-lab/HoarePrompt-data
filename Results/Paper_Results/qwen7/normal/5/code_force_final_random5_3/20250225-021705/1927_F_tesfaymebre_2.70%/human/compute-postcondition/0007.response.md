Output State: `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `test_cases` must still be greater than 0. This is because the loop continues to execute as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0, and since the problem does not specify any operation inside the loop that would change the value of `test_cases`, it remains greater than 0 until the loop finishes all its iterations.
