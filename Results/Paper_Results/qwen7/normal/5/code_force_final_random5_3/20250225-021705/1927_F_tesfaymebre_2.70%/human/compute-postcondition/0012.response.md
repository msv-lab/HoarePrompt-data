Output State: **The program returns a set `res` containing the return value from the dfs function call, and `node_v` is in the set `res`**.

This means that the `dfs` function was called with the current vertex `curr` and its neighbor `nei`, and the result of this function call is stored in the set `res`. Since `node_v` is mentioned to be in the set `res`, it indicates that the `dfs` function returned a set containing `node_v`.
