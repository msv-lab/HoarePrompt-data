You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m) is a tuple of two integers where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2 * 10^5), edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v, w) represents an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, and DSU is a data structure representing Disjoint Set Union with additional attributes like `find`, `union`, and `min_edge`.
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: Output State: `edges` is now a list containing tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` for each iteration of the loop, `n` is the return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the return value of `func_3()`, and `graph` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `m-1`, `u`, `v`, and `w` are the return values of `func_3()`. After all iterations, `graph[u]` will contain all vertices `v` that are connected to `u` with their corresponding weights `w`, and vice versa for `graph[v]`. The length of `edges` will be equal to `m`, and `i` will be equal to `m - 1`.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: Output State: All nodes in the graph will be merged into connected components, and `node_u` and `node_v` will hold the values of the nodes that form the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph. Specifically, `node_u` and `node_v` will point to the two nodes that have the smallest edge weight among all the edges that were processed during the loop. The `dsu.min_edge` attribute will reflect the minimum edge weight within the connected component that `node_u` belongs to, and `_min_edge` will hold the overall minimum edge weight found during the entire execution of the loop.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the overall minimum edge weight found during the loop and len(res) is the number of nodes in the DFS traversal starting from node_u)
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: [node] ... [node] (where [node] represents the nodes visited during the DFS traversal starting from node_u)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but uses a pre-defined DSU data structure, a tuple (n, m) where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2 * 10^5), and a list of tuples edges where each tuple (u, v, w) represents an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. The function returns information based on the minimum edge found using the DSU data structure.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
