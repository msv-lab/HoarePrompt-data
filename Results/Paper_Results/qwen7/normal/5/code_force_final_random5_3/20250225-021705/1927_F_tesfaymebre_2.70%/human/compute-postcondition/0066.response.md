Output State: **`colors` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `node_u` and `node_v` point to the two nodes that form the MST, `dsu.min_edge` reflects the minimum edge weight within the connected component that `node_u` belongs to, `_min_edge` holds the overall minimum edge weight found during the entire execution of the loop, `res` is the result of the dfs function call `dfs(node_u, -1, [])`**.

In this case, the `dfs` function is called with `node_u` as the starting node, `-1` as the parent (indicating no parent for the root), and an empty list as the third argument. The `res` variable is assigned the return value of this function call. However, without knowing the exact return value of the `dfs` function, we cannot specify the exact value of `res`. Therefore, we state that `res` is the result of the function call, keeping all other variables as they were in the initial state.
