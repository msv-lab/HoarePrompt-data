Postcondition: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `curr` appended to it, the color of the vertex `curr` is now 1, `nei` is an integer representing a valid neighbor of `curr`, `graph[curr]` has at least one neighbor, the color of `nei` is not 2, and `nei` is not equal to `parent`; `res` is a set containing the return value from the dfs function call, and `node_v` is in the set `res`.**
