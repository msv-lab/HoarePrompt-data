Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is the root node of `node_u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `node_v` in the DSU structure, the DSU structure has united `node_u` and `node_v` under the same root node.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` function call unites the nodes `node_u` and `node_v` in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure. This means that both `node_u` and `node_v` now share the same root node in the DSU structure. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
