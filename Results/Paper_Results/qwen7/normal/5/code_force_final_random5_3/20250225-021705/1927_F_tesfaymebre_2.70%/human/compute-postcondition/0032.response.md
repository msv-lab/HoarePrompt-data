Output State: **`colors[curr]` is set to 2, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are unvisited neighbors (color != 2) of the current vertex (`curr`) that are not the parent vertex. For each such neighbor, the DFS function is called recursively. If at any point the DFS call returns a non-empty result containing `node_v`, the function will return that result. If no such result is found after all possible paths are explored, the function will eventually return `None`.**

In this state, the color of the current vertex (`curr`) is marked as visited by setting `colors[curr]` to 2. The loop and DFS calls remain as described in the initial state, continuing to explore the graph until all possible paths are exhausted or `node_v` is found.
