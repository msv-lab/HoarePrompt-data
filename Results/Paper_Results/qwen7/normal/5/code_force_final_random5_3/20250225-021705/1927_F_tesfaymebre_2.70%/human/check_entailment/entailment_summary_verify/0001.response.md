### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program step-by-step against the problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - This part is handled by `func_7()` and `func_6()`.

2. **Graph Representation:**
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`).
   - Edges are stored in a list (`edges`).

3. **Sorting Edges:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights using `edges.sort(reverse=True)`.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - A DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to keep track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component.
   - The DSU is initialized with `dsu = DSU(n + 1)`.

5. **Finding Minimum Edge in a Cycle:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges in reverse order.
   - For each edge `(u, v, w)`, it checks if `u` and `v` belong to the same connected component.
   - If they do, it updates the minimum edge weight and stores the nodes involved in the cycle.
   - If they don't, it unites the components and continues.

6. **Cycle Detection and Path Tracing:**
   - After finding the minimum edge in a cycle, it uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to trace the path from one of the nodes (`node_u`) to the other (`node_v`).
   - The DFS function ensures that no node is visited more than once to avoid cycles within the cycle.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It also prints the vertices in traversal order.

### Verification

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles multiple test cases correctly.
  - It correctly sorts edges in descending order of weights.
  - It uses DSU to efficiently find connected components and update minimum edge weights.
  - The DFS function correctly traces the path without revisiting nodes.

- **Correctness:**
  - The program logic is sound and follows the problem requirements.
  - It correctly identifies the minimum-weight edge in a cycle and traces the path.

### Function Summaries

- **Function 7 (`func_7`):**
  - Processes multiple test cases and calls `func_6()` for each test case.
  - Ensures that `test_cases` remains greater than 0 after processing all test cases.
  - Does not return any value.

- **Function 6 (`func_6`):**
  - Reads the number of vertices (`n`) and edges (`m`), and then reads the edges with their weights.
  - Initializes a DSU and processes the edges to find the minimum-weight edge in a cycle.
  - Uses DFS to trace the path and prints the result.

### Conclusion

Upon re-evaluation, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. The logic is sound, and the program handles all aspects of the problem as required.

**Final: True**

The program is correct.
