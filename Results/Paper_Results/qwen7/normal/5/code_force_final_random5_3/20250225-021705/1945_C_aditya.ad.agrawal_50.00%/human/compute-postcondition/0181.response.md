Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. `pos` will be equal to the length of the final `arr`, which is `n`. `o_r` and `o_l` will both be 0 because all ones have been processed. Similarly, `z_r` will be 0, and `z_l` will be the total number of zeros in `arr`. `b_d` will be the minimum absolute difference between `n / 2` and any position that meets the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`. `ans` will be the position that minimizes this distance.
