Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    input_string = input()
    arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
    z = arr.count(0)
    o = arr.count(1)
    z_r = z
    o_r = o
    z_l = 0
    o_l = 0
    dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
        b_d = dist
    else:
        b_d = 30001
    for i in arr:
        pos += 1
        if i == 0:
            z_l += 1
            z_r -= 1
        else:
            o_l += 1
            o_r -= 1
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(
            n / 2 - pos):
            ans = pos
            b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `z_r` is the total count of 0s in `arr` minus the count of 0s encountered up to the last element, `o_r` is the total count of 1s in `arr` minus the count of 1s encountered up to the last element, `z_l` is the count of 0s encountered up to the last element, `o_l` is the count of 1s encountered up to the last element, `b_d` is 30001 if no position satisfies the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, otherwise it is the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the position where the condition is met, and `ans` is the position where the condition is met if such a position exists, otherwise it remains 0; `t` is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is decreased by 1, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `o_l` is the total count of 1s in `arr`, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the total count of 0s in `arr`, `ans` is the position that minimizes the distance to `n/2` while satisfying the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is the minimum absolute difference between `n/2` and any position that meets the conditions, and `z_r` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `pos` is the length of `arr`, `o_r` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is 0, `z_l` is the total number of zeros in `arr`, `b_d` is 1, `ans` is `pos` minus the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`, `t` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
