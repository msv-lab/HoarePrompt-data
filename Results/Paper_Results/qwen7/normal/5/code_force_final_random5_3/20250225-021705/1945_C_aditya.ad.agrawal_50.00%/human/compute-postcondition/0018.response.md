Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in arr:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting each character of `input_string` to its corresponding integer value.
   - `i` is the current element being processed in the list `arr`.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. The loop body is omitted, but we need to ensure that the loop can execute properly.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `arr`, the initial state of `arr` should be such that it contains at least one element (otherwise, the loop would not execute).
   - The variable `i` will take on the values from the list `arr` during each iteration of the loop.

5. **Consider the constraints and conditions**:
   - The initial state of `arr` should be valid for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` is not specified, but it will be the first element of `arr` in the first iteration.

Given the above points, the necessary adjustments are:

- Ensure `arr` is a non-empty list.
- The value of `i` will be the first element of `arr` in the first iteration.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the first element of `arr`**.
