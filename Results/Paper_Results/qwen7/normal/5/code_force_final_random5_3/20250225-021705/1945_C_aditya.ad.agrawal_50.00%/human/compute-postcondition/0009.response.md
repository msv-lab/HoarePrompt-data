Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting each character of `input_string` to its corresponding integer value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0.**

The code initializes `z_l` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, or `o_r`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
