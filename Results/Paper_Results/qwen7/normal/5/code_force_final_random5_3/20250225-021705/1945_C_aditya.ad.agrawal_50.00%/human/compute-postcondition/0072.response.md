Output State: **`input_string` is a string read from input, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n / 2`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0**.

The code initializes three new variables: `dist`, `ans`, and `pos`. The value of `dist` is set to the absolute value of `n / 2`, which is currently undefined since `n` is not specified. The values of `ans` and `pos` are both set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
