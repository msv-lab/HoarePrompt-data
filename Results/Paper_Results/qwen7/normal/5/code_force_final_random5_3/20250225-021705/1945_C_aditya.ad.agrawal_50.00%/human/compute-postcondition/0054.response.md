Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the fifth element of `arr`, `pos` is 5, `z_r` is either 4 or one less than its original value, `o_r` is updated accordingly, `z_l` is 6, `o_l` are updated accordingly, `b_d` is 1, and `ans` is 5.**

Explanation: The line `ans = pos` assigns the value of `pos` (which is 5) to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
