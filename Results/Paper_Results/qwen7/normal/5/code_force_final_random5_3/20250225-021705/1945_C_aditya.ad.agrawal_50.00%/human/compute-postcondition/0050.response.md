Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the fifth element of `arr`, `pos` is 5, `z_r` and `o_r` are updated based on the value of `i`, `z_l` remains unchanged, `b_d` is 1, and `ans` is 4.**

Explanation: The code increments `o_l` by 1. Initially, `o_l` was part of the state where `z_l` and `o_l` were updated based on the value of `i`. Since no specific value for `o_l` was given initially, we know it was updated based on `i`, but its exact value is not needed for the final state. After incrementing `o_l` by 1, the new value of `ans` becomes 3 + 1 = 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
