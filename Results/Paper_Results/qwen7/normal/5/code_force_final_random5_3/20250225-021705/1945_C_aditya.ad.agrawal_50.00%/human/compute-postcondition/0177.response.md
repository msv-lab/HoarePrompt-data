Output State: **`pos` is the length of `arr`, `o_r` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is 0, `z_l` is the total number of zeros in `arr`, `b_d` is 1, `ans` is the position where `b_d` was last updated, which is `pos` minus the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `pos` will be equal to the length of the array `arr`. The counters `o_r` and `o_l` will both be 0 since they are decremented each time a non-zero element is encountered. Similarly, `z_r` will be 0 as it is only decremented when encountering zeros, and `z_l` will be the total count of zeros in the array `arr`. The variable `b_d` will remain 1 unless the condition `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` was never met during any iteration, in which case it would be the maximum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` seen during the loop. Finally, `ans` will be the position where `b_d` was last updated, which is `pos` minus the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.
