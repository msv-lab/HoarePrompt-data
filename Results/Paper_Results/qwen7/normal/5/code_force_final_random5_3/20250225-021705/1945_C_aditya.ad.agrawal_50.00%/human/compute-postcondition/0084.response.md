Output State: **`o_l` is 0 more than its original value, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `pos` is 2, and `o_r` is 1 less than its original value.**

Explanation: The variable `o_r` is decremented by 1. Since `o_l` was originally 1 more than its original value, it now is 0 more than its original value (assuming it was originally the same as `o_r`). The values of `i`, `pos`, and the original value of `o_r` remain unchanged.
