Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `i` is the third element of `arr`.
   - `pos` is 3.
   - `z_r` and `o_r` are updated based on the value of `i`.
   - `z_l` and `o_l` are updated accordingly.
   - `b_d` is 1.
   - `ans` is 3.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `arr`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `i` is 0, then `z_r` remains unchanged (or becomes 0), `o_r` becomes 1, and `z_l` is increased by 1.
   - If `i` is not 0, then `z_r` becomes 1, `o_r` remains unchanged (or becomes 0), and `o_l` is increased by 1.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is the third element of `arr` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will now process the fourth element of `arr`.
   - `pos` will be incremented to 4.
   - `i` will be the fourth element of `arr`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `arr` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` changes to the fourth element of `arr`.
   - `pos` changes to 4.
   - `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, and `o_l` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `b_d` remains 1.
   - `ans` remains 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the fourth element of `arr`, `pos` is 4, `z_r` and `o_r` are updated based on the value of `i`, `z_l` and `o_l` are updated accordingly, `b_d` is 1, and `ans` is 3.**
