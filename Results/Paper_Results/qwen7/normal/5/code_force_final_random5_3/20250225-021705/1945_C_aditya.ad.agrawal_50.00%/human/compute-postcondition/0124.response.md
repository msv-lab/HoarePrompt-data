Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers converted from `input_string`, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `o_l` is the total count of 1s in `arr`, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the total count of 0s in `arr`, `ans` is the position that minimizes the distance to `n/2` while satisfying the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is the minimum absolute difference between `n/2` and any position that meets the conditions, `z_r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `input_string` is the input read from the user; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `z = arr.count(0)` counts the number of zeros in the list `arr` and assigns the result to the variable `z`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
