Output State: **`i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 4, `o_l` is 0 more than its original value, `o_r` is 1 less than its original value, `z_l` is 1 more than its original value, `ans` is 2, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `z_l` is incremented by 1. Since `z_l` was originally 0 if `i` equals 0, otherwise it retained its original value, after incrementing by 1, `z_l` is now 1 more than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
