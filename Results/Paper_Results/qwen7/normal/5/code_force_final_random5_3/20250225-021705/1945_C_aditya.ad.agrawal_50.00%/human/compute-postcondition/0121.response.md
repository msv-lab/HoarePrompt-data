`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `pos`, `o_l`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `ans`, `b_d`, and `z_r`) remain unchanged from their initial states. 

Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `o_l` is the total count of 1s in `arr`, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the total count of 0s in `arr`, `ans` is the position that minimizes the distance to `n/2` while satisfying the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is the minimum absolute difference between `n/2` and any position that meets the conditions, `z_r` is 0, and `n` is an input integer.**
