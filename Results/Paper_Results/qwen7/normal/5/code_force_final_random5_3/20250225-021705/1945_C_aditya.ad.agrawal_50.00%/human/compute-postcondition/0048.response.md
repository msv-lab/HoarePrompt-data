Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the fifth element of `arr`, `pos` is 5, `z_r` and `o_r` are updated based on the value of `i`, `z_l` is 6 (since `z_l` was 5 and was incremented by 1), `o_l` are updated accordingly, `b_d` is 1, and `ans` is 3.**

Explanation: The variable `z_l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 5 to 6. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
