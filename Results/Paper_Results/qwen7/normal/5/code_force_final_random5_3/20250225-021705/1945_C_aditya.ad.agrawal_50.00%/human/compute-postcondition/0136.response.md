Output State: **`i` is now the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 1**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is set to be the first element of the list `arr`. The code `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. Since `pos` was initially 0 (as it is the index of the first element), after the increment, `pos` becomes 1. This means that `i` is now updated to be the element at index 1 of the list `arr`.
