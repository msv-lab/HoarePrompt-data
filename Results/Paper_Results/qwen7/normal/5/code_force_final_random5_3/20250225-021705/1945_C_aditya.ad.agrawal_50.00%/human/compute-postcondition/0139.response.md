Output State: **`i` is 0; `pos` is 1; `z_l` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `z_l` is incremented by 1. Initially, `z_l` was not specified, but since no other value was given, we assume it was 0 before this line of code. After executing `z_l += 1`, the value of `z_l` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `pos` remain unchanged.
