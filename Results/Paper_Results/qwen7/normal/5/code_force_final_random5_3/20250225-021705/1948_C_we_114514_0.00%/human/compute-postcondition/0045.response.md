Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `reachable_first_row` is either False or remains unchanged (depending on the value of `j`).**

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = True` updates the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`. The other variables (`results`, `reachable_first_row`, and `j`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
