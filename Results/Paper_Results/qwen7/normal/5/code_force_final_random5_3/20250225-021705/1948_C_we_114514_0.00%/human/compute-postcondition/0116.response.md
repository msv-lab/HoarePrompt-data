Postcondition: `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>', with no change to these variables since the if condition `j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>'` is not met.
