State: **`results` is an empty list, test_cases is a non-empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `test_case` and the iterable `test_cases`.
2. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `test_cases`.
3. The variable `results` is not involved in the loop condition or iteration, so its state does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `test_cases` must be a non-empty list.
