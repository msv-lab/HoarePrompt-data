Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_case` is split into `n` and a tuple `(row1, row2)` where `row1` and `row2` are elements of the tuple from `test_case`.**

This means that the first element of `test_case` is assigned to `n`, and the second element (which is expected to be a tuple) is unpacked into `row1` and `row2`. The `results` list remains unchanged and is still empty.
