Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is either False or remains unchanged, and `j` is `n`.**

The code simply reassigns `reachable_second_row` to `True`, which does not affect the values of `results`, `reachable_first_row`, or `j`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
