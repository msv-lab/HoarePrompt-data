Postcondition: `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>', regardless of the if condition, as the else part is not present and the if condition directly sets the value of `row2[j]` to '>' when `reachable_second_row` is True.
