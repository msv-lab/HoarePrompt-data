Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `test_case` in the `for` loop statement.
2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**: The given state at the end of the previous iteration is:
   - `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO']
   - `reachable_first_row` is False
   - `reachable_second_row` is True
   - `j` is equal to `n`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are more `test_cases` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `test_case` will be the next element in the `test_cases` list.
   - The variables `results`, `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, and `j` (which is equal to `n`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

Given that no modifications to these variables are specified in the loop body and they are not directly used in the loop condition, their values remain the same for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `j` is equal to `n`**.
