Postcondition: `j` is less than `n`, `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `test_case` is updated to contain the next element in `test_cases`, `row1` is the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the updated second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`, and `reachable_second_row` is True, the current value of `row2[j]` is '>', and `j` equals `n - 1`.
