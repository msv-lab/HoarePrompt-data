You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case in test_cases is a list containing three elements: an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even), and two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid, where each string consists of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>' indicating the direction of the arrow in each cell.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, (row1, row2) = test_case
        
        reachable_first_row = True
        
        reachable_second_row = False
        
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
        
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing either all 'YES' or a mix of 'YES' and 'NO', depending on the contents of `test_cases`. For each `test_case` in `test_cases`, if `reachable_second_row` is True at the end of the loop execution for that `test_case`, the corresponding element in `results` is 'YES'. Otherwise, it is 'NO'. The variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are reset to their initial states (False and False, respectively) before each new `test_case` is processed. The variable `j` is set to `n` at the end of each iteration through `test_cases`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain one 'YES' for every `test_case` where `reachable_second_row` was True at the end of processing that `test_case`, and 'NO' otherwise.
    return results
    #`results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether `reachable_second_row` was True at the end of processing each `test_case` in `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `t` and a list `test_cases`. For each `test_case` in `test_cases`, it processes an integer `n` and two strings representing the first and second rows of a grid. It returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether it was possible to reach the second row from the first row following the directions of the arrows.

```

Return Postconditions: `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether `reachable_second_row` was True at the end of processing each `test_case` in `test_cases`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
