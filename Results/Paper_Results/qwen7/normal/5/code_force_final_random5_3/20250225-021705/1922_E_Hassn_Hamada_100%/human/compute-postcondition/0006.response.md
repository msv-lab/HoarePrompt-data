Output State: **`size_overlap` is (0, 0), sequence must be non-negative, `i` is max(sequence, default=0), `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is set to `max(sequence, default=0)`.
- The code then assigns `size` the value of `i + 1`.
- It also assigns `value` the value of `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`, which simplifies to `2^(i+1) - 2^i = 2^i * (2 - 1) = 2^i`. Therefore, `value` is `2^i`.

Since no other variables are affected, the output state includes the updated values of `size` and `value`, along with the unchanged initial conditions.
