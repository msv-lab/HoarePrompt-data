Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is \((1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) \leq number\).

2. **Analyze the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `size`: This is derived from `i` as `size = i + 1`.
   - `i`: This is derived from `sequence` as `i = max(sequence, default=0)`.
   - `number`: This is an external variable not directly modified within the loop.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `size_overlap` is (0, 0).
   - `sequence` must be non-negative.
   - `i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`.
   - `size` is `i + 1`.
   - `value` is \((1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)\).

4. **Check the loop condition with the current state**:
   - Since `i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`, and `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` is at least 0.
   - Therefore, `size` is `i + 1`, which means `size` is at least 1.
   - The expression \((1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)\) simplifies to \(2^{size + 1} - 2^i\).

5. **Evaluate the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, \((1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) \leq number\) must be true.
   - Given `size` is at least 1 and `i` is at least 0, the smallest possible value for \((1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)\) is \(2^2 - 2^0 = 4 - 1 = 3\).

6. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - To ensure the loop executes the first time, `number` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `number` is at least 3.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`size_overlap` is (0, 0), sequence must be non-negative, `i` is max(sequence, default=0), `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is \((1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)\), and `number` must be at least 3**.
