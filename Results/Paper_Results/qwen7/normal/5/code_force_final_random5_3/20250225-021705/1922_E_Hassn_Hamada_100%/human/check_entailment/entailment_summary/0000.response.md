Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to generate an array of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences in the array equals a given integer \(X\). The program should handle up to 1000 test cases, each with a value of \(X\) ranging from 2 to \(10^{18}\).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers that will yield the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - It uses bitwise operations to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The function works recursively to build the sequence by appending numbers in a specific pattern.

3. **Execution Summary Analysis**:
   - The function correctly handles the base case where `number` is 0, returning two zeros.
   - For non-zero `number`, it calculates a `size_overlap` pair which helps in determining how many times a particular number should appear in the sequence.
   - It then appends these numbers to the `sequence` list in a way that ensures the desired number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The main loop reads the test cases and calls `func_1` to generate the sequence for each test case.
   - It prints the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles large values of \(X\) (up to \(10^{18}\)) using bitwise operations, ensuring efficient computation.
   - The generated sequences are within the specified range of \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to generate the required sequence for each test case. The function `func_1` is designed to handle the constraints and produce the correct sequences.

Correctness: **True**
