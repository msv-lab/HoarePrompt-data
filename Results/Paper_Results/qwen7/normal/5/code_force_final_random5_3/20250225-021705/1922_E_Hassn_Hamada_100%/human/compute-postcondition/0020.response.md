Output State: **`size_overlap` is (`i` + 3, `i`); `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` must be at least 2, `size` is `i` + 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their initial conditions remain unchanged.
