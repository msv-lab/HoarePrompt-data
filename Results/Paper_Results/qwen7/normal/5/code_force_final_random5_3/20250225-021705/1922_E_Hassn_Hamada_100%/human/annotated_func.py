    #
    #This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `size_overlap` will be set to (12, 0) because the loop continues to increment `size` until it reaches its maximum possible value given the constraints, which in this case is 12 when `i` is 0 and `number` is at least 128. The `value` calculated during the final iteration is 1022, and since `i` is now 0, no further changes occur to `size_overlap`.

    #State: Output State: `i` is 11, `size - overlap` is 12, `sequence` contains the values `overlap`, `i + overlap`, `i + 2 * overlap`, ..., `i + 11 * overlap`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - overlap - 1`, which means it will run 12 times since `size` is 12 and `overlap` is 0. After 12 iterations, `i` will be 11. During each iteration, the value `i + overlap` is appended to `sequence`. Since `overlap` is 0, the sequence will contain `0`, `1`, `2`, ..., `11`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `number` (where \(2 \leq number \leq 10^{18}\)) and a list of integers `sequence`. It generates a sequence of numbers based on `number` and modifies `sequence` accordingly. If `number` is 0, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a `size_overlap` pair and appends a sequence of numbers to `sequence` based on this pair. Finally, it recursively calls itself with updated `number` and `sequence` values. The function ultimately returns two zeros.
