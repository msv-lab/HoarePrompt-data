Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `size - overlap`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is given as 0.
   - `size` is 12.
   - `overlap` is part of the tuple `size_overlap`, which is (12, 0). Therefore, `overlap` is 0.

3. **Calculate the condition for the loop to start executing**:
   - The loop runs for `range(size - overlap)`.
   - Substituting the known values: `size - overlap = 12 - 0 = 12`.
   - Therefore, the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i < 12`.

4. **Check if the loop can start**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` should be less than `size - overlap`.
   - Given `i = 0` and `size - overlap = 12`, the loop can start because `0 < 12`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 0 and `size - overlap` is 12, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - The value of `size - overlap` is fixed at 12, so no adjustment is needed for this calculation.
   - The other variables (`size_overlap`, `number`, `sequence`, and `value`) are not involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the final state after adjusting the necessary variables is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `size - overlap` is 12**
