Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers based on a given number (`number`). The goal is to create a sequence that results in a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence. It starts by calculating a `size_overlap` pair, which helps in determining how many elements to append to the sequence.
   - The sequence is built by appending values in a pattern that ensures the desired number of increasing subsequences. This is achieved through the loop that appends values to the sequence based on the `size` and `overlap`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - When `number` is 0, the function returns two zeros, indicating the base case of recursion. This is a correct termination condition.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function calculates the `size_overlap` by iterating backward from the maximum value in the current sequence. This helps in determining the number of elements to append to the sequence.
   - The sequence is built by appending values in a way that ensures the desired number of increasing subsequences. The values are calculated using bitwise operations, which are correctly used to determine the number of elements to append.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The annotated program correctly prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself. The logic within the function ensures that the sequence generated will have the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified by the input `number`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `number` is 0 by returning immediately, which is correct.
   - The function also correctly handles larger values of `number` by recursively calling itself with updated parameters.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` and the overall program logic are correct in generating a sequence that meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
