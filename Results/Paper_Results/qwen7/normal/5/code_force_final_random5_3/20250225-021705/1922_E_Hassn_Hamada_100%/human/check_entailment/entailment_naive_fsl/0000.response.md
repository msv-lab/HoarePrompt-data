Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence based on the input number, but it does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. 

For instance, consider the input `X = 37`. The program attempts to generate a sequence, but it does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will have exactly 37 increasing subsequences. The logic within `func_1` is complex and does not seem to correctly map the input `X` to a sequence with the desired property.

To verify this, we can test the program with a few values:

1. For `X = 2`, the expected output is `[0]` since the only increasing subsequences are the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just `0`.
2. For `X = 5`, the expected output could be `[0, 1, 0]` because it has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[], [0], [1], [0, 1], [0]`.

However, the provided program does not generate these sequences correctly. For example, for `X = 37`, the program outputs a sequence that does not have exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
