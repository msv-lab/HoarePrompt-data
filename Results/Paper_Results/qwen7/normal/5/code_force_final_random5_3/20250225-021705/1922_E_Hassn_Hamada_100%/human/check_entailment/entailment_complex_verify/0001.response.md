### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The provided solution attempts to generate such an array using a recursive function `func_1`.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses bitwise operations to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The goal is to create a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `X`.

3. **Base Case and Recursive Case**:
   - If `number` is 0, the function returns immediately.
   - For non-zero `number`, it iterates backward from the maximum value in the current sequence to find the appropriate size and value for the next element in the sequence.
   - It updates the sequence and recursively calls itself with the updated `number`.

4. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The sequence generation logic seems to be based on powers of 2, which is a common approach to achieve specific counts of increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence is built by appending values that ensure the desired count of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output Handling**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It calls `func_1` to generate the sequence and prints its length and elements.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the base case correctly when `number` is 0.
   - It uses bitwise operations to efficiently determine the sequence structure, which is crucial for achieving the exact count of increasing subsequences.

7. **Validation**:
   - The provided code does not explicitly handle cases where it is impossible to generate the required sequence (e.g., when `X` is too large).
   - However, the approach seems sound for the given constraints.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Bitwise Operation in `func_1`**:
  - The bitwise operations used in the function do not correctly generate the sequence for all values of `X`. Specifically, the line `while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:` is problematic. This condition is not sufficient to generate the correct sequence for all values of `X`.
  - For example, consider `X = 37`. The function will not correctly generate a sequence that results in exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

- **Lack of Explicit Error Handling**:
  - The code does not handle cases where it is impossible to generate a sequence with the exact number of increasing subsequences. This can lead to incorrect outputs or infinite recursion.

### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Example Test Case Analysis**:
  - For `X = 37`, the function will not correctly generate a sequence. The sequence generation logic based on powers of 2 is insufficient to cover all possible values of `X`.
  - The function will either produce a sequence that does not meet the exact count or fail to terminate properly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X`. The bitwise operations and recursive approach are not sufficient to handle all edge cases and produce the correct sequences.

### Final:
**False**

The original assessment was inaccurate due to the identified issues with the sequence generation logic and the lack of proper error handling.
