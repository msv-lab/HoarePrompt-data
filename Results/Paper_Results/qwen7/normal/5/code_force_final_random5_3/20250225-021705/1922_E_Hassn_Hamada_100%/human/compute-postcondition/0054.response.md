Output State: **`size_overlap` is (12, 0), `size` is 12, `i` is 0, `number` must be at least 128, `value` is 1022.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values or affect the initial state of the variables. It simply exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.
