Output State: **`i` is 2, `size - overlap` is 12, `sequence` contains the values `overlap`, `i + overlap`, and `i + 2 * overlap`**

Explanation: The code `sequence.append(i + overlap)` appends the value of `i + overlap` to the list `sequence`. Given that `i` is 2 and `overlap` is part of the initial sequence, the new value to be appended is `i + overlap` which is `2 + overlap`. Therefore, the updated sequence now contains `overlap`, `i + overlap` (which is `2 + overlap`), and the newly added `i + 2 * overlap` (which is `2 + 2 * overlap`). The values of `i` and `size - overlap` remain unchanged.
