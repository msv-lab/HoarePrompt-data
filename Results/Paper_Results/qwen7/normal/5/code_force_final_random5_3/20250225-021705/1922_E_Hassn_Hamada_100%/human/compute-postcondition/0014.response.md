Output State: **`size_overlap` is (2, 1), `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` must be at least 1, `size` is `i + 3`, `value` is \(2^{i+3} - 2^i\), and `number` must be at least 12**.

Explanation: The code `size += 1` increments the value of `size` by 1. Initially, `size` was `i + 2`. After incrementing, `size` becomes `i + 3`. All other variables (`size_overlap`, `sequence`, `i`, `value`, and `number`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
