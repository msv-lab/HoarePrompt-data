Output State: **`size_overlap` is (1, 1), `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` must be at least 1, `size` is `i + 2`, `value` is \(2^{i+2} - 2^i\), and `number` must be at least 3.**

Explanation: The value of `value` is updated to \(2^{i+2} - 2^i\). The other variables (`size_overlap`, `sequence`, `i`, `size`, and `number`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
