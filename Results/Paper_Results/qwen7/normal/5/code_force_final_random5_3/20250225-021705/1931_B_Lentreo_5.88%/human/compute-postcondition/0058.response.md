Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the `nums` list.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over each element in `nums`, the initial value of `i` should be the first element of the `nums` list.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `nums`**: For the loop to execute, the `nums` list must contain at least one element. This ensures that there is something for `i` to iterate over.

4. **Consider the Given States**:
   - `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list.
   - `last` is the last element of the updated `nums` list.
   - `curr` is currently set as the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `curr` and `last` are derived from the `nums` list, but they don't directly affect whether the loop can execute. The loop can execute as long as `nums` has at least one element.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums` has at least one element.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `nums` must have at least one element.
- `i` should be the first element of the `nums` list.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list, `last` is the last element of the updated `nums` list, `nums` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of the `nums` list**.
