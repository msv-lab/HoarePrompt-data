Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the initial value of `last`. If `curr` equals 0, then `curr` remains 0. Otherwise, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the initial value of `last`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` but does not affect the values of `curr`, `nums`, or `last`. Therefore, the precondition regarding `curr` remains unchanged.
