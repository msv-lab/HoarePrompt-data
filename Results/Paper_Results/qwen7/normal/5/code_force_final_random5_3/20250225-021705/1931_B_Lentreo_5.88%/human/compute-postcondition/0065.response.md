Output State: **`curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list plus the value of `i` minus the last element of the updated `nums list`, `i` is the next element in the `nums` list.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` by adding the difference between `i` and the last element of the `nums` list to the current value of `curr`. The initial state of `curr` is defined as the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list. After executing the code, `curr` is updated to include the value of `i` minus the last element of the `nums` list. The value of `i` remains the next element in the `nums` list.
