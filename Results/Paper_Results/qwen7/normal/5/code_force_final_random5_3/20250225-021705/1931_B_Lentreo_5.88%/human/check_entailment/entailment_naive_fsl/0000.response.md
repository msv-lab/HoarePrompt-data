Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the program checks if the difference between each element and the last element is zero, which is not sufficient to determine the possibility of equalizing the water in all containers.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
1 2 3 4
```

The program would output "YES" because all elements are different from the last element, but it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water since the total amount of water (10) cannot be evenly distributed among 4 containers.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the average amount of water per container is an integer. This can be done by calculating the total amount of water and dividing it by the number of containers. If the result is an integer, it means the water can be evenly distributed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        avg_water = total_water / n
        if avg_water.is_integer():
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected program checks if the average amount of water per container is an integer, which correctly determines if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
