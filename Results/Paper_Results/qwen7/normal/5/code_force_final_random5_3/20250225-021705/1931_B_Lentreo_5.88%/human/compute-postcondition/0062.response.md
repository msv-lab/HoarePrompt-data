Postcondition: `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list. If the first element `i` of the `nums` list is not 0, then `curr` is adjusted by adding `i` and subtracting the last element `last` from `nums`. If `i` is 0, no change is made to `curr`.
