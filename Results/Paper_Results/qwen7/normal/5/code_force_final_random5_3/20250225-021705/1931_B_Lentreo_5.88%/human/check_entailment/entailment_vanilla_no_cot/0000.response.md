Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the program is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program checks if the sum of differences between each element and the last element is zero. This is not a correct approach to solve the problem.
2. **Correct Approach**: To solve this problem, we need to check if the average amount of water per container is an integer. If the total amount of water divided by the number of containers (n) results in an integer, then it is possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers.

### Correct Solution:
Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        avg_water = total_water / n
        
        # Check if the average is an integer
        if avg_water.is_integer():
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution calculates the total amount of water and checks if dividing it by the number of containers results in an integer. If it does, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
