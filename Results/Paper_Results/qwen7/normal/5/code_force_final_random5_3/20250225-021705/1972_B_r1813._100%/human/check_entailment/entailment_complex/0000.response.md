Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins (facing up or down).
2. The annotated program reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of the number of coins `n` and a string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
3. The program counts the number of 'U's (coins facing up) in the string `s` for each test case.
4. If the count of 'U's is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
5. The logic in the program correctly implements the rule that Alice wins if the count of 'U's is odd, and Bob wins if the count of 'U's is even.
6. The program processes all test cases as expected and prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic implemented in the program matches the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
