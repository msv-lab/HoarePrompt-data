### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is an efficient way to handle multiple test cases when the total input size might be large.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program iterates through each test case, extracting the necessary information (`n` and `s`) for each case.
3. **Counting 'U' Coins**: For each test case, the program counts the number of 'U' coins in the string `s`.
4. **Determining Winner**: The program checks if the count of 'U' coins is odd. If it is, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
5. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if Alice wins and "NO" if Bob wins.

### Analysis:

- The logic correctly identifies that if the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice can force a win by playing optimally. This is because Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of 'U' coins for Bob, ensuring she can always respond to Bob's moves until Bob is forced into a losing position.
- The implementation handles multiple test cases efficiently and correctly processes each case based on the given rules.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the number of 'U' coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
