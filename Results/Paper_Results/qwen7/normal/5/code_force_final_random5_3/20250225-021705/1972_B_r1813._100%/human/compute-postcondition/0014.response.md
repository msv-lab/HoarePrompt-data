Postcondition: `data` is a list with at least one positive integer as its first element, `n` is the integer at index 1 of `data`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `index` is 4, `count_u` is the number of 'U's in the string `s`. If the count of 'U's in `s` is odd, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If the count of 'U's in `s` is even, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
