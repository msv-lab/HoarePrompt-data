Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string from `sys.stdin.read` on whitespace.**

In this case, the variable `t` is updated to be the integer value of the first element in the `data` list. The values of `n`, `s`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial state.
