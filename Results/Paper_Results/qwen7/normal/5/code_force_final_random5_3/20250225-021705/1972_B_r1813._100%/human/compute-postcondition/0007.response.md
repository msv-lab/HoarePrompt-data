Output State: **`data` is a list with at least one positive integer as its first element, `n` is the integer at index 1 of `data`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `index` is 4, `s` is now the string at index 3 of `data`.**

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Initially, `index` was 2, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 4. The values of `data`, `n`, `s`, and their relationships remain unchanged.
