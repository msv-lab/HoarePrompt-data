Based on the initial state provided:

- `data` is a list with at least one positive integer as its first element.
- `n` is the integer at index 1 of `data`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".
- `index` is 4.
- `count_u` is the number of 'U's in the string `s`, and it is specified that `count_u` is odd.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
