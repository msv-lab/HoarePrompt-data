Postcondition: **`data` is a list with at least one positive integer as its first element, `n` is the integer at index 4 of `data`, `s` is the string at index 5 of `data`, `index` is 6, `count_u` is the number of 'U's in the string `s`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `count_u` is updated to the number of 'U's in the string `s`. If `count_u` is odd, no changes are made to `count_u`. If `count_u` is even, no changes are made to `count_u`.**
