Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` remains as the original positive integer, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits of `i`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each digit of the integer `i`, converting each digit to an integer and adding it to `sum_value_digits`. Once all digits have been processed, `sum_value_digits` will hold the total sum of all digits in `i`. The variable `x` will no longer be used after the loop completes, and `i` itself does not change during the loop.
