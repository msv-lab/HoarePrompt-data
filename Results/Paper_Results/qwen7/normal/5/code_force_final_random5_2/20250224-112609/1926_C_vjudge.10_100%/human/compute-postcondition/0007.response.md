Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `x` in the expression `for x in str(i):`. This means that `x` takes on each character (digit) from the string representation of `i`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` must be a positive integer and its string representation must be non-empty.
   - `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each digit in the string representation of `i`.
   - For each iteration, `x` represents a single digit from `i`.
   - `sum_value_digits` is updated by adding the integer value of `x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is a single digit from the string representation of `i`, the string representation of `i` remains unchanged.
   - `i` itself does not change within the loop, but `sum_value_digits` is updated.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - The string representation of `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of the current digit `x`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i`'s string representation remains the same, and `sum_value_digits` is updated by the integer value of the current digit `x`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` must be a positive integer and its string representation must be non-empty; `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of the current digit `x`**
