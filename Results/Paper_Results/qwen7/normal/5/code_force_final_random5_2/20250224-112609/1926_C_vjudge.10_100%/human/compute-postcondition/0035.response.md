Output State: `i` is a positive integer + 1, `x` is the last digit of the final string representation of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits in the string representation of `i`, `values[i + 1]` is `values[i] + sum_value_digits`.

In this final state, `i` remains a positive integer incremented by 1. The variable `x` holds the last digit of the final value of `i`. The variable `sum_value_digits` contains the sum of all digits in the complete string representation of the final `i`. Finally, `values[i + 1]` is updated to reflect the addition of `sum_value_digits` to its previous value, as determined by the loop's cumulative effect on all iterations.
