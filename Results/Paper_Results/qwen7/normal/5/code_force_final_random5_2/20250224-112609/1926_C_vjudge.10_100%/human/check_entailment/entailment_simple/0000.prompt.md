Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be 200001, `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of the digits of `i-1`, and `values[200001]` will be the cumulative sum of `sum_value_digits` for all integers from 1 to 200000.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, and `value` will be an input integer that has never been used within the loop during its execution. The variable `sum_value_digits` will hold the sum of the digits of `200000 - 1`, which is 18 (since 1 + 9 + 8 + 9 + ... + 1 + 9 + 8 + 9 = 18), and `values[200001]` will be the cumulative sum of `sum_value_digits` for all integers from 1 to 200000, which is 18 * 200000 / 2 = 1,800,000.
