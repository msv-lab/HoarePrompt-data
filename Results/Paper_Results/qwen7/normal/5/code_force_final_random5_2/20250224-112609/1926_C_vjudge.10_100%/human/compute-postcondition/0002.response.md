Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list named `values` with 200001 elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `inf` remain unchanged from their initial states.
