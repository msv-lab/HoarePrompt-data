You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be 200001, `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of the digits of `i-1`, and `values[200001]` will be the cumulative sum of `sum_value_digits` for all integers from 1 to 200000.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, and `value` will be an input integer that has never been used within the loop during its execution. The variable `sum_value_digits` will hold the sum of the digits of `200000 - 1`, which is 18 (since 1 + 9 + 8 + 9 + ... + 1 + 9 + 8 + 9 = 18), and `values[200001]` will be the cumulative sum of `sum_value_digits` for all integers from 1 to 200000, which is 18 * 200000 / 2 = 1,800,000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` within the range 1 to 200000. For each test case, it calculates the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `n` and prints this value. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program attempts to precompute the sum of the digit sums for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and store them in an array `values`. However, this approach is inefficient and unnecessary for solving the problem as described.

The problem requires calculating the sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to \(n\) for each test case. The current implementation uses a large array `values` to store precomputed results, which is not needed and can lead to incorrect results due to the way the array is populated and used.

A correct approach would involve directly computing the sum of digit sums for numbers from 1 to \(n\) without precomputing all possible values. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def sum_of_digit_sums(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += digit_sum(i)
    return total_sum

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print(sum_of_digit_sums(n))
```

This corrected program directly computes the sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to \(n\) for each test case, ensuring correctness for all inputs within the specified constraints.
