Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` in the range from 1 to infinity (`inf`). Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the specified range. Since the range is from 1 to infinity, the loop will continue as long as `i` is a positive integer.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is a positive integer.
   - `sum_value_digits` contains the sum of all digits of `i`.
   - `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i` is a positive integer, `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The value of `sum_value_digits` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.
   - The value of `values[i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and the newly calculated `sum_value_digits`.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of the digits of the new value of `i`.
   - `values[i]` will be `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is a positive integer (i + 1), `sum_value_digits` contains the sum of all digits of `i + 1`, and `values[i + 1]` is equal to `values[i] + sum_value_digits`**.
