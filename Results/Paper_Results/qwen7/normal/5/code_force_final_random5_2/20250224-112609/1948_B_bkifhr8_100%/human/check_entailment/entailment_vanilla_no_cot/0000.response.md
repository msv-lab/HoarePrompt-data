Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Sorted Order**: The logic to check if it's possible to sort the array does not correctly handle the transformation rules. Specifically, the code checks if the elements can be rearranged into a sorted order by comparing adjacent elements and splitting the larger one, but it doesn't fully account for the transformation process.

2. **Misunderstanding the Transformation Process**: The solution incorrectly assumes that if the numbers can be split and rearranged into a sorted order, it means the original array can be transformed into a sorted array. This is not always true because the transformation process involves inserting digits back into the array, which can change the relative order of elements.

3. **Incomplete Handling of Test Cases**: The function does not properly handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement. It reads all inputs at once and processes them in a loop, which is not aligned with the expected input format where each test case should be processed independently.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the transformation process for each test case and check if the array can be sorted after applying the operations any number of times. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def can_sort_array(arr):
    while True:
        sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
        if arr == sorted_arr:
            return True
        changed = False
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i] >= 10:
                num_str = str(arr[i])
                new_elements = [int(digit) for digit in num_str]
                arr[i:i+1] = new_elements
                changed = True
                break
        if not changed:
            return False

def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index]); index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index]); index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index+n])); index += n
        
        if can_sort_array(arr):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This solution reads the input for multiple test cases, processes each test case individually, and checks if the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the transformation operations.
