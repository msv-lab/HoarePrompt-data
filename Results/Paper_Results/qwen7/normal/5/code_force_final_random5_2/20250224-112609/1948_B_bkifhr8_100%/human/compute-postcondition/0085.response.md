Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The current state of `nums` is not sorted.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `arr[i]`, `arr[i-1]`, or `nums`. The condition that `arr[i]` is an integer less than `arr[i-1]` and that `nums` contains each digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]` remains unchanged. The list `nums` is also not sorted, as no sorting operation was performed.
