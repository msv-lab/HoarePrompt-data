Output State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is set to `False`, and `i` is now `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `ans`. The values of `arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i]`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition regarding whether `nums` is sorted or not does not affect the assignment of `ans` since `ans` is explicitly set to `False`.
