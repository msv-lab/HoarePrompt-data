Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `ans` is still set to False, and `arr[0]` remains unchanged.**

The code `m = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `m`. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, and `arr[0]`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
