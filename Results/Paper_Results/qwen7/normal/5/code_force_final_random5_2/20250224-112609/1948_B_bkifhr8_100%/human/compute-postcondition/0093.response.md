Output State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `nums` is sorted, the conditions remain the same as the precondition. Additionally, `i` is now `i - 1`; `nums` is updated to `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]`.**

Explanation: The code converts `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and appends `arr[i]` to it. So, `nums` is now a list of digits from `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The conditions regarding `arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i]`, `nums`, and `ans` remain the same as before, but `i` is decremented by 1.
