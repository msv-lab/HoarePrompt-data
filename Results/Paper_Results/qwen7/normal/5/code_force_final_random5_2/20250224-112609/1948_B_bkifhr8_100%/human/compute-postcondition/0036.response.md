Output State: **Postcondition: `ans` is `False`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is 0, and `arr[i - 1]` (which corresponds to `arr[-1]`) is updated to be equal to the integer value of the last element of `arr` concatenated with the element at index `m - 1` in `arr`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will decrement from `m-1` down to 0. The loop breaks when it finds an element that does not satisfy the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and sets `ans` to `False`. Since the loop has executed three times and `ans` is already set to `False`, it means the loop did not find any pair of elements where the current element is less than the previous one. Therefore, `ans` remains `False`. The final state of `arr` will have the last element of the original list concatenated with the element at index `m-1` in the list, as this is the last operation performed before the loop exits.
