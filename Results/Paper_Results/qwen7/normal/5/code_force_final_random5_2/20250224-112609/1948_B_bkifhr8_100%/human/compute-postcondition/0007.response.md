Postcondition: `ans` is `True`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is `m - 1`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`.
