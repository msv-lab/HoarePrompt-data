Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional statement is mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the context where it was used. The values of `ans`, `arr[i]`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
