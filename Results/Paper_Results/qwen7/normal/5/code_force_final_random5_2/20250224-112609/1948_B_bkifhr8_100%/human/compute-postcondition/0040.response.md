Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `m` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a string input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2) due to the nature of the code snippet provided, but the values of `ans`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
