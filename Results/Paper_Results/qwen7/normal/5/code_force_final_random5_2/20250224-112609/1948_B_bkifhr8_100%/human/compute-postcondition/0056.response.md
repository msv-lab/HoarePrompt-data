Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `m - 1` down to `1` (exclusive), with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts from `m - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `ans` remains False
   - `arr[1]` is `nums[0]`

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than 0. Since `i` will be 1, the loop will continue to execute.

6. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 1
   - `m` remains unchanged and is still greater than or equal to 1
   - `ans` remains False
   - `arr[1]` remains `nums[0]`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` remains False, and `arr[1]` is `nums[0]`**
