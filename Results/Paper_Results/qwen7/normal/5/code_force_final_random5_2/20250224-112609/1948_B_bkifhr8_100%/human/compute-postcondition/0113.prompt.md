Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is `False`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is 0, and `arr[i - 1]` (which corresponds to `arr[-1]`) is updated to be equal to the integer value of the last element of `arr` concatenated with the element at index `m - 1` in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` being 0, `m` remaining greater than or equal to 1, `ans` still set to False, and `arr[0]` updated according to the conditions within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop will continue to iterate from `m - 1` down to 1. For each iteration, if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, the elements `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` will be concatenated into a new list `nums`, which contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. This list `nums` is then checked to see if it is sorted. If it is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. If `nums` is sorted, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`.

After all iterations of the loop, if no break occurred (meaning `ans` remained `True`), the final state of the array `arr` will be such that for every pair of consecutive elements where the second element is less than the first, the first element has been updated to match the smallest value in the sequence formed by concatenating and sorting the digits of the two elements. If a break did occur, `ans` will be `False`, indicating that the condition was violated at some point during the loop's execution.

The variable `i` will be 0 after the loop completes, as the loop decrements `i` from `m - 1` to 0. The variable `m` will remain unchanged, and `ans` will either be `True` or `False` depending on whether the loop's condition was met throughout all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
