Output State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `nums` is sorted, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, while the rest of the conditions and variables stay the same as they were before the code execution.
