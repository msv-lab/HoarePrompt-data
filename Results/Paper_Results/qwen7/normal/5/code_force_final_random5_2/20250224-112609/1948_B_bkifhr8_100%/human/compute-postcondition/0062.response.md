Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` remains False, `arr[1]` is `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `nums[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates `arr[i - 1]` (which is `arr[0]` since `i` is 1) to be equal to `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `nums` was originally a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`, after updating `arr[0]` to be `nums[0]`, `nums` now contains the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `nums[0]`. All other conditions and values remain as stated in the initial state.
