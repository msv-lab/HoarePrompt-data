Output State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is set to `False`, and `i` is now `i - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are updated or reassigned, their states remain as they were before the `break` statement.
