Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `m` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `ans` is still set to `False`.
- `arr[0]` is updated according to the conditions within the loop, but this specific update does not affect the print statement directly.

The print statement is:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

Given that `ans` is `False`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` will evaluate to `'NO'` because `False` corresponds to the first element in the list, which is `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
