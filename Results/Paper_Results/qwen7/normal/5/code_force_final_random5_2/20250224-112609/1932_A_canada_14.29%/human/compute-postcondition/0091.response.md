Output State: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list, `thorn` is either 3, 2, or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `s`, `i`, or `thorn`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the variables retain their initial states.
