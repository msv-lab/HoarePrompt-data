Output State: **`thorn` is 0**

The condition `thorn == 0` checks if the variable `thorn` is equal to 0. Since `thorn` was initially 0, the condition is satisfied, but the condition itself does not change the value of `thorn`. Therefore, the value of `thorn` remains 0. All other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.
