Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters (consisting only of '.', '@', and '*') is read, with the first character being '.', indicating the start of an empty cell. The function returns a specific output based on the given conditions for each test case.**
