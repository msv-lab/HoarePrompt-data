Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character (minus the first character), `ret` is 1 if the character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 2 or 4 depending on whether the character `i` was not '*' before or was '*', respectively, and if the loop or if statement is broken, `thorn` remains as 2 or 4, otherwise `thorn` is reset to 0.
