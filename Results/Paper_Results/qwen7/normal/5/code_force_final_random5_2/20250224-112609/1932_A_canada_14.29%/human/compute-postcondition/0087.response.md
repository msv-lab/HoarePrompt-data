Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the list `s`. After each iteration, `i` takes the next character from the list `s`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a list of characters with at least one character.
   - `i` is the next character in the list.
   - `thorn` is either 2, 1, or 0.

4. **Consider the Possible Values of `i` and Their Effects**:
   - If `i` equals `@`, `thorn` becomes 0.
   - If `i` equals `*`, `thorn` becomes either 2 or 1 depending on its original value (0 or 1).
   - If `i` does not equal `*` or `@`, `thorn` is set to 0.

5. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `s` must still contain at least one character. Therefore, `s` should have at least one character left.
   - `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.
   - `thorn` will be adjusted based on the value of `i` as described above.

Given these points, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

- Since `s` must have at least one character left for the loop to continue, `s` must have at least one character.
- `i` will be the next character in `s`.
- `thorn` will be adjusted based on the value of `i` as per the given conditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list, and `thorn` is either 2, 1, or 0.**
