Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a list of characters entered by the user, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `len` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn == 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list of characters, `i` is the first character in the list `s`. If the first character `i` is '@', then `thorn` is 1 and `ret` is 1. If the first character `i` is '*', then `thorn` is 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `thorn` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the second character in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0 if `i` is not '*', and `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*'. Additionally, `ret` is 1 if `i` is '*', and `ret` is either `i` + 1 if `i` is '*' and `thorn` equals 2, or `ret` remains 0 if `i` is not '*'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the third character in the list `s`, `thorn` is either 2 (if `i` is '*', and the most internal loop or if statement is broken) or 0 (if `i` is not '*', or the else part is executed), and `ret` is updated to 0 if `thorn` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
