Output State: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list, `thorn` is either 2 or 1 based on the value of `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `s`, `i`, or `thorn`. It only indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and the only effect is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional structure.
