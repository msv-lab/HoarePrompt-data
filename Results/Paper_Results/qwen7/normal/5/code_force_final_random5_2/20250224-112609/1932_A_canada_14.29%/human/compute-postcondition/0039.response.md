Output State: **`thorn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character (minus the first character), `ret` is 1 if the character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 1 or 3 depending on whether the character `i` is not '*', and `thorn` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '*'**.

Explanation: The line `thorn = 0` sets the variable `thorn` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
