Output State: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list, `thorn` is either 3, 2, or 1.**

Explanation: The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1. Since `thorn` was initially either 2, 1, or 0, after adding 1, `thorn` will now be either 3, 2, or 1 respectively. The lists `s` and the variable `i` remain unchanged.
