Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character (minus the first character), `ret` is 1 if the character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the character `i` and the value of `thorn` after the if-else block executes. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1 and set to either 1 or 3, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `thorn` equals 2. If `i` is not '*', `thorn` remains 0.
