Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it is the length of `arr` minus 1. The condition that `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]` is also unchanged.
