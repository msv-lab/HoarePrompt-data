### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(arr)` to compute the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal and prints the result.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - It first finds the longest subarray where all elements are the same starting from the beginning (`i`).
   - Then, it finds the longest subarray where all elements are the same starting from the end (`j`).
   - If the entire array is already uniform, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum cost between two scenarios:
     - Changing the entire array except the prefix of length `i`.
     - Changing the entire array except the suffix of length `j`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases like when the entire array is already uniform or when the array is uniform from the start or end but not both.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the correct minimum cost for making all elements of the array equal.

However, there are several issues with the function `func_1` that make the program incorrect:

- **Incorrect Calculation of `i` and `j`**:
  - The loop to calculate `i` increments `i` until it finds a pair of elements that are not equal. This means `i` will be the index of the first element that is different from the previous one, which is not necessarily the length of the array minus one.
  - Similarly, the loop to calculate `j` decrements `j` until it finds a pair of elements that are not equal. This means `j` will be the index of the first element that is different from the next one, which is not necessarily zero.

- **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
  - The function incorrectly assumes that `i` and `j` represent the lengths of the subarrays from the start and end, respectively. However, `i` and `j` are actually the indices of the first differing elements.
  - The cost calculation should be based on the lengths of the subarrays from the start and end, not the indices.

- **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
  - The function does not handle the case where the entire array is uniform correctly. It should return 0 if the entire array is uniform, but it does not do so.

Given these issues, the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final:
**False**
