Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The execution summary describes a simplified version of what the function might do, but it does not match the actual logic in the `func_1` function.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initial Checks**: 
   - The initial checks in the `func_1` function only compare adjacent elements starting from the beginning and end of the array. This means it doesn't account for the possibility of having multiple segments of equal elements within the array.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`, the function would incorrectly identify that all elements from the start to the second last element are equal, leading to an incorrect result.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - The function does not calculate the minimum cost required to make all elements equal using the allowed operation. Instead, it seems to be checking if the first and last elements are the same and returning a value based on that.
   - The logic `return max(j - i - 1, 0)` and `return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)` does not reflect the correct approach to minimize the cost of making all elements equal.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - Given the example test cases, the function does not produce the correct results. For instance, for the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the expected output is 4 burles, but the function would not correctly compute this.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect in terms of solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
