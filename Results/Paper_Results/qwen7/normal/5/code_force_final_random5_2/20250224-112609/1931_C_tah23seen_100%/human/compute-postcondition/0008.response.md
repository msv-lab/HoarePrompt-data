Output State: **`i` is 4, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]`, and `len(arr)` must be greater than 4, and `arr[3]` must be equal to `arr[4]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
