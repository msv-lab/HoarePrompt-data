The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a non-negative integer. It first checks if all elements from the start to the second last element of the array are equal. If they are, it returns the maximum value between `j - i - 1` and 0, where `j` is 0 and `i` is the length of `arr`. If not all elements are equal, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j`, which is 0, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
