Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.
2. **Current state**: 
   - `i` is the length of `arr`.
   - `j` is `j - 1`.
   - `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition involves two variables: `j` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.
   - We need to ensure that both parts of the condition are met for the loop to continue.

4. **Analyze the condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be greater than 0.
   - Additionally, `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is currently `j - 1`, we need to ensure that `j` is still greater than 0.
   - We also need to ensure that `arr[j]` remains equal to `arr[j - 1]` for the next iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` must be greater than 0.
- `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

Therefore, the modified state is:
State: **`i` is the length of `arr`, `j` must be greater than 0, and `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`**.
