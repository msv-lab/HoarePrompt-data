Output State: `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` are equal.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the condition `j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` will eventually evaluate to `False` when `j` becomes 0. At this point, the loop terminates. Since the loop decrements `j` by 1 each time it finds consecutive equal elements, `j` will reach 0, meaning we have checked all elements up to the second last one. Therefore, `j` will be 0, and `i` will be the length of `arr`, indicating that the loop has completed without finding any unequal consecutive elements beyond the second last one.
