### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(arr)` to compute the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal and prints the result.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - It first finds the longest subarray where all elements are the same starting from the beginning (`i`).
   - Then, it finds the longest subarray where all elements are the same starting from the end (`j`).
   - If the entire array is already uniform, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum cost between two scenarios:
     - Changing the entire array except the prefix of length `i`.
     - Changing the entire array except the suffix of length `j`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases like when the entire array is already uniform or when the array is uniform from the start or end but not both.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the correct minimum cost for making all elements of the array equal.
