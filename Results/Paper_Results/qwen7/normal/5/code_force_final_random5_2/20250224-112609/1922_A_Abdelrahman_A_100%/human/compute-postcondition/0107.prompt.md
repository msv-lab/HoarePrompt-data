Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `no` is True, `i` is 2, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the input from the user, `c` is the new input string, `counter` is 0
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
        no = False
        print('YES')
        break
    counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `no` is False, `i` is 2, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the input from the user, `c` is the new input string that must have at least one character, `counter` is 1, `x` is not in the current element of `a` at index `counter` and `x` is not in the current element of `b` at index `counter`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `no` remains False, `i` is 2, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the input from the user, `c` is the new input string that must have at least two characters, `counter` is 3, and `x` is not in the current element of `a` at index `counter` or `x` is not in the current element of `b` at index `counter`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `no` remains False, `i` is 2, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the input from the user, `c` is the new input string that must have at least one character, `counter` is 4, and either `x` is not in the current element of `a` at index `counter` and `x` is not in the current element of `b` at index `counter`, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
