Postcondition: `counter` is incremented by 1, the value of `no` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x` is not found in both `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`, then `counter` is incremented by 1, the value of `no` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
