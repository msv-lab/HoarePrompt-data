Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3` is an input integer, `y3` is an input integer, `x4` is an input integer from the second input, `y4` is an input integer from the second input, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, and the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` does not equal `x3` or `x2` does not equal `x4`.
