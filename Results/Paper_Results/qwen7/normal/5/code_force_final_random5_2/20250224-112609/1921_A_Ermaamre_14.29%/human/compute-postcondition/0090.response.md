Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers.
- `res` is calculated based on specific conditions involving these input integers.

The value of `res` is determined as follows:
- If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.
- If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.
- If both `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.
- Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.

In any case, `res` will be one of the absolute differences between pairs of `y` coordinates based on the specified conditions.

When the code snippet `print(res ** 2)` is executed, it will square the value of `res` and print it.

Output: **the square of the absolute difference between y1 and y2 or y1 and y3 depending on the conditions (where res is the absolute difference between y1 and y2 or y1 and y3 based on the specified conditions)**
