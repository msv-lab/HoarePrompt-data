Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It processes t test cases, where each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns nothing (None).**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases without needing any input parameters. Each test case provides the coordinates of the corners of a square, and the function processes these coordinates to determine if they form a valid square with a positive area. However, since the specific processing logic is not detailed, the function's primary action is to receive and process these test cases, and it does not return any specific output.
