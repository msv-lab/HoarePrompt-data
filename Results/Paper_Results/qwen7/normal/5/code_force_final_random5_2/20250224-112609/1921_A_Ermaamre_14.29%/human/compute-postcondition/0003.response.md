Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning the first integer to `x2` and the second integer to `y2`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, and `y1` remain unchanged.
