Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y4` is the second integer from the input split by space, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` and assigns it to `res`. Since `y1` is greater than or equal to `y3`, `res` will be `y1 - y3`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
