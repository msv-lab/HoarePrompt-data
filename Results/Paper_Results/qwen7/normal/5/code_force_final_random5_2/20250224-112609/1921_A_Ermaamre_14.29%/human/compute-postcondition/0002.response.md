Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `x1` and `y1`. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
