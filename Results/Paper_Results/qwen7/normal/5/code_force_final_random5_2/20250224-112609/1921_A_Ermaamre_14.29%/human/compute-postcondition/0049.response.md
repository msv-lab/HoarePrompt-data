Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is the first integer from the input, `y1` is the second integer from the input, `x2` is the second integer from the input, `y2` is the second integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y3` is the second integer from the input split by space, `x4` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y4` is the second integer from the input split by space, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, `x3, y3` are assigned the integer values from the input, `x4, y4` are assigned the integer values from the input.**

Explanation: The code `x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `x4` and `y4`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
