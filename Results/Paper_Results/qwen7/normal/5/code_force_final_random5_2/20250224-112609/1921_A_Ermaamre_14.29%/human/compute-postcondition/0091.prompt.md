Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
    x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
        if y1 < y3:
            res = abs(y3 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y3)
    elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    print(res ** 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y4` is the second integer from the input split by space, and `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are assigned as per the input, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` is not equal to `x4` or `x3` is not equal to `x2`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, and `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3` is an input integer, `y3` is an input integer, `x4` is an input integer from the second input, `y4` is an input integer from the second input, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, and the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` does not equal `x3` or `x2` does not equal `x4`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
