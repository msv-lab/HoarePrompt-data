Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y4` is the second integer from the input split by space, and `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.
