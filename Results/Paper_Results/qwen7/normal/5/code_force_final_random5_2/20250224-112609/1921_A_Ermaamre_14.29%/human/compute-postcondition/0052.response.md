Postcondition: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are as defined, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.**
