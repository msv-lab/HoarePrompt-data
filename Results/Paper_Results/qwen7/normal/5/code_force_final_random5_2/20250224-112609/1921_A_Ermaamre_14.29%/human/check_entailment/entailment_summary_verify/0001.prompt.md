You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

    for i in range(a):

- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 100 test cases, where each test case involves four lines of input representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. Based on specific conditions related to the coordinates, it calculates the height of the square and prints the square of this height. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly computes the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, and `(x4, y4)`.

2. **Identifying Opposite Sides:**
   - The program checks if the points form a square by assuming that opposite sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - It uses three conditions to check if the points can form a square:
     - `x1 == x3 and x2 == x4`: This means the vertical distance between the points should be the same.
     - `x1 == x2 and x3 == x4`: This means the horizontal distance between the points should be the same.
     - `x1 == x4 and x3 == x2`: This means another possible configuration for the square.

3. **Calculating the Side Length:**
   - If the points satisfy any of the above conditions, the program calculates the side length of the square.
   - It assumes that the smaller `y` value is the starting point and the larger `y` value is the ending point for the vertical distance calculation.
   - Similarly, it does the same for the horizontal distance if the points are horizontally aligned.

4. **Area Calculation:**
   - Once the side length is calculated, the program squares it to get the area of the square.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Assumption:**
   - The program makes an assumption that the points will always be in a specific order (e.g., vertical alignment before horizontal). This is not necessarily true. The points could be in any order, and the program needs to handle all possible configurations.

2. **Handling All Configurations:**
   - The program only checks three specific configurations. There are other possible configurations where the points could still form a square but are not covered by these checks.

3. **No Validation for Square:**
   - The program does not validate if the points indeed form a square. It assumes the points are already in a valid configuration without checking the distances between all pairs of points.

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     1 2
     4 5
     1 5
     4 2
     -1 1
     1 -1
     1 1
     -1 -1
     45 11
     45 39
     17 11
     17 39
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     9
     4
     784
     ```

2. **Program Output:**
   - The program will output the correct area for the first and third test cases but might fail for the second test case due to the incorrect assumptions.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible configurations of the square points and does not validate if the points form a square. Therefore, the program cannot be considered correct for all possible inputs.
