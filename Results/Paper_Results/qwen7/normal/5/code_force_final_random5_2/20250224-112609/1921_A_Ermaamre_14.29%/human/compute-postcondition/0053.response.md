Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is the first integer from the input, `y1` is the second integer from the input, `x2` is the second integer from the input, `y2` is the second integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y3` is the second integer from the input split by space, `x4` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y4` is the second integer from the input split by space, `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `abs(y2 - y1)` to `res`. Since `y1` and `y2` are already defined as integers from the input, `res` now holds the absolute difference between these two values. The other variables remain unchanged.
