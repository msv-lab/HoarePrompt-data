Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are assigned as per the input, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` is not equal to `x4` or `x3` is not equal to `x2`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, and `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`; `x2` is updated to an input integer, `y2` is updated to an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x2` and `y2`. The conditions for `res` remain unchanged, and the values of `x2` and `y2` are updated to the input values.
