Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly identify the side length of the square. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Opposite Corners**: The logic used to identify which pairs of points are opposite corners of the square is flawed. It only checks three specific configurations out of the possible six configurations (since the order of points can vary).

2. **Assumption of Order**: The code assumes a specific order of the points, which is not guaranteed. For example, it checks if `x1 == x3 and x2 == x4` or similar, but this does not cover all possible permutations of the corner points.

3. **Calculation of Side Length**: Even if the correct pair of opposite corners were identified, the calculation of the side length would be correct. However, the logic to identify the correct pair of opposite corners is insufficient.

Given these issues, the program will not always correctly identify the side length of the square, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
