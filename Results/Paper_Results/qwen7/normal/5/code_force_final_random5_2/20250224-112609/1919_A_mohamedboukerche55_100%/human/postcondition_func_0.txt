The function reads a number of test cases (`t`) and for each case, it takes two non-negative integers (`a` and `b`). It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. Based on this check, it prints 'Bob' or 'Alice' respectively, for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints 'Bob' or 'Alice' a total of `t` times.
