### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The key observation here is that the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob wins. If it is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains the values of `a` and `b` separated by a space.
   - It splits the string `s` into a list and converts the first and second elements to integers, assigning them to `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'. Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in the code correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins.
   - The code handles multiple test cases as expected.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic when considering the optimal play strategy.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initial Assumption:**
  - The initial assessment assumes that the sum of `a` and `b` determines the winner based on the parity of the sum.
  - This assumption is correct in terms of the final outcome but does not consider the optimal play strategy.

- **Optimal Play Strategy:**
  - When both players play optimally, the game can be analyzed as follows:
    - If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, Bob can always force Alice to lose by ensuring that the sum remains even after each of Alice's moves.
    - If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, Alice can always force Bob to lose by ensuring that the sum remains odd after each of Bob's moves.

- **Flaw in the Code:**
  - The code simply checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` at the end of each test case without considering the sequence of moves.
  - This means that the code does not simulate the actual game play and does not account for the optimal strategies of both players.

### Example Counter-Example:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 2
```

- According to the code, since `3 + 2 = 5` (which is odd), the output should be "Alice".
- However, let's analyze the game:
  - Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob, making the new values `2` and `3`.
  - Bob can then choose to swap back, making the values `3` and `2`.
  - Alice can again choose to swap, making the values `2` and `3`.
  - This process continues until one of them cannot make a valid move.
  - Since the sum is odd, Alice can always ensure that she makes the last move, forcing Bob to lose.

Thus, the correct output for this test case should be "Alice", not "Bob".

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the optimal play strategy and therefore does not accurately determine the winner based on the optimal game logic.

**Final: False**
