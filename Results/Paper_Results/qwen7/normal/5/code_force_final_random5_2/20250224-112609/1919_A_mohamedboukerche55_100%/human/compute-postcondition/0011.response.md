Postcondition: `a` is the first integer from the input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the input string `s`, `t` must be at least 1, and if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the program does not change the values of `a`, `b`, or `t`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the program does not change the values of `a`, `b`, or `t` either.
