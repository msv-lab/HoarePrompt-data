Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for k in M.keys():`. This means the loop variable `k` will take each key from the dictionary `M`.

2. **Determine Relevant States:**
   - The relevant states are those that are directly involved in the loop head and the loop body. In this case, the loop variable `k` is the only variable directly involved in the loop head.

3. **Understand the Loop Body Implications:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider what the loop might do with `k`. Since `k` is a key in the dictionary `M`, the loop body likely involves operations on `M[k]`.

4. **Current States Before the Loop:**
   - `cnt` is an empty list.
   - `cur` is the highest value present in the list `N`.
   - `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` appears in `N`.
   - All other values in `M` will be zero or represent counts of numbers less than `cur` in `N`.
   - The list `N` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `T` is decreased by the total number of iterations the loop executed.
   - If the sum of all values in `M` equals `S`, `cur` is increased by 1; otherwise, no changes are made to `cur` and `M`.

5. **Adjusting States for the Loop to Execute:**
   - Since `k` is a key in the dictionary `M`, the loop can execute as long as `M` is not empty (i.e., it contains at least one key).
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `M` is not empty before the loop starts.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, the dictionary `M` must contain at least one key.

### Final Answer:
State: **`cnt` is an empty list, `cur` is the highest value present in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` appears in `N`, all other values in `M` will be zero or represent counts of numbers less than `cur` in `N`, the list `N` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `T` is decreased by the total number of iterations the loop executed, and `M` must contain at least one key.**

This ensures that the loop can start executing since it requires `M` to have at least one key.
