Output State: **`cur` is an integer increased by 1, `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list with at least one fewer element, and `M` is a dictionary.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, while the values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `M` remain unchanged from their initial states.
