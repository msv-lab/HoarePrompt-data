Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` is a list.
- If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, then `cur` is equal to the second element of the list `cnt`.
- Otherwise, no change occurs to `cur` and `cnt` remains as it was before the if-else block.

We need to determine the value of `cur` when the `print(cur)` statement is executed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**: The condition to check is whether the length of `cnt` is at least 2.
2. **Value of `cur`**:
   - If `len(cnt) >= 2`, then `cur` is set to the second element of `cnt`.
   - If `len(cnt) < 2`, then `cur` retains its previous value (which is not specified but doesn't change).

Since the exact contents of `cnt` are not provided, we consider both cases:
- If `cnt` has at least two elements, `cur` will be the second element.
- If `cnt` has fewer than two elements, `cur` remains unchanged.

Given that the exact content of `cnt` is not specified, we can only describe `cur` in terms of its definition.

### Conclusion:
- If `cnt` has at least two elements, `cur` is the second element of `cnt`.
- If `cnt` has fewer than two elements, `cur` remains unchanged.

Since the exact value of `cur` cannot be determined without knowing the contents of `cnt`, we describe it as follows:

Output: **cur (where cur is the second element of cnt if len(cnt) >= 2, otherwise it remains unchanged)**
