Output State: **`cur` is now equal to `num`, `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list with at least two fewer elements, and `M` is a dictionary.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
