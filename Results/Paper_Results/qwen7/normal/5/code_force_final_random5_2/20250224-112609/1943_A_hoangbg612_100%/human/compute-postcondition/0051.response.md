Output State: **`k` is the next key in the dictionary `M`, `M` is the same dictionary, `cnt` is a list containing the element `k` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. Since `cnt` was initially a list containing the element `k` if `M[k]` equals 1, and now `k` is appended to it regardless of the condition, `cnt` now contains `k` twice. However, since the problem does not specify the initial content of `cnt` when `M[k]` equals 1, we assume it was already containing `k` before this operation. Therefore, `cnt` now contains `k` appended to its existing elements.
