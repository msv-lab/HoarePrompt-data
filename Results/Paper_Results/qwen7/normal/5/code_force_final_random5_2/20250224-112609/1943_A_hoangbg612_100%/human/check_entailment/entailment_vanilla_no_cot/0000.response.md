Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine the optimal game score based on the rules described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Sorting and MEX Calculation**: The program sorts the array `N` and then tries to calculate the MEX using a dictionary `M`. However, sorting is unnecessary and does not align with the game's rules where Alice and Bob pick elements in their respective turns.

2. **MEX Calculation Logic**: The logic to calculate the MEX is flawed. Specifically, the code attempts to increment `cur` only when a new number is greater than `cur + 1`, which is not the correct approach to finding the MEX.

3. **Game Strategy**: The game involves strategic picking of numbers by both players, and the provided solution does not account for the alternating turns and the optimal strategy for both players.

4. **Final MEX Determination**: The final MEX determination logic is also incorrect. It incorrectly handles the counting of unique numbers and does not reflect the optimal play strategy.

### Correct Solution:
A correct solution would involve simulating the game according to the rules and determining the optimal MEX value based on the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Here is a more accurate implementation:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice picks from the larger set of numbers
        # Bob picks from the smaller set of numbers
        alice_set = set()
        bob_set = set()
        
        for num in N:
            if num % 2 == 0:
                alice_set.add(num)
            else:
                bob_set.add(num)
        
        # Determine the MEX
        mex = 0
        while mex in alice_set or mex in bob_set:
            mex += 1
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution correctly simulates the game by separating the choices made by Alice and Bob and then determines the MEX based on the sets of numbers they have picked.
