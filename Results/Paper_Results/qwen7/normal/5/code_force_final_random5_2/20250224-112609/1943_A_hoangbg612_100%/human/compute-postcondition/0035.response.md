Postcondition: `cur` is an integer, `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list with at least two fewer elements, and `M` is a dictionary. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`, then no changes occur to the variables.
