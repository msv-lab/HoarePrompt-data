Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`. Instead, the program sorts the array and then tries to determine the MEX of the resulting array, which does not reflect the game's rules.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program will produce an incorrect result. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the program does:

1. It reads the input values.
2. It sorts the array `N` to `[0, 0, 1, 1]`.
3. It initializes `cur` to `-1` and creates a dictionary `M` to keep track of the counts of each number.
4. It iterates through the sorted array and updates the dictionary:
   - For `num = 0`, it checks if `num > cur`. Since `cur` is `-1`, it sets `cur` to `0` and adds `0` to the dictionary `M` with a count of `1`.
   - For `num = 0`, it again checks if `num > cur`. Since `cur` is now `0`, it sets `cur` to `0` and increments the count of `0` in `M`.
   - For `num = 1`, it checks if `num > cur`. Since `cur` is `0`, it sets `cur` to `1` and adds `1` to the dictionary `M` with a count of `1`.
   - For `num = 1`, it again checks if `num > cur`. Since `cur` is now `1`, it sets `cur` to `1` and increments the count of `1` in `M`.

After processing the array, the dictionary `M` is `{0: 2, 1: 1}`. The program then sums the counts in `M` and checks if it equals the length of the array (`S`). Since the sum is `3` and the length of the array is `4`, it increments `cur` to `2`.

Finally, it prints `cur`, which is `2`.

This result is incorrect because, according to the game rules, Alice and Bob take turns picking elements. In an optimal play scenario, Alice would pick `0` first, then Bob would pick `0`, then Alice would pick `1`, and finally Bob would pick `1`. This results in the array `c` being `[0, 1]`, which has an MEX of `2`.

The program does not simulate the turns correctly and instead just processes the array in a sorted order, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
