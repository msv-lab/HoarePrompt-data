Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value `1`, and the current value of `num` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`.**

In this state, the dictionary `M` now contains the key `cur` with the value `1`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or constraints mentioned in the initial state.
