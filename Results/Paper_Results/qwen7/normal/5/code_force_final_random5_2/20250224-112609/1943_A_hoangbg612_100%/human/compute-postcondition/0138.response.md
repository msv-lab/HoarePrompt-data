Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, `cur` is greater than or equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. The initial conditions of `N` being a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order and `cur` being greater than or equal to `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, these conditions are still valid in the output state, and only `M[cur]` has been updated by adding 1 to its current value.
