Output State: **`cnt` is now ['k'], `cur` is the highest value present in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` appears in `N`, all other values in `M` will be zero or represent counts of numbers less than `cur` in `N`, the list `N` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `T` is decreased by the total number of iterations the loop executed, and `M` must contain at least one key, and the current value of `M[k]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `cnt` now includes `k`, while `cur`, `M[cur]`, `N`, `T`, and `M` retain their original properties and values.
