Output State: **cur is the last element in N plus 1, and M[cur] is 1 if cur was not previously in M, or it is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of cur in N. The sum of all values in M is equal to S.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `cur` is now the original value of `cur` plus 1. The dictionary `M` and its properties (including the condition for the value of `M[cur]`) and the sum `S` remain as they were before the increment.
