Output State: **`N` is not empty, `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` updates the value of `cur` to be the same as `num`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The conditions involving `num` and `cur` are preserved, with `num` still being greater than `cur`.
