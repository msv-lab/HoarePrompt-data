Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop iterates over the keys of the dictionary `M`. Therefore, the objects involved are `k`, which represents each key in `M`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `k`**: Since the loop is iterating over the keys of `M`, the variable `k` will take on the value of each key in `M` during each iteration.

3. **Consider the initial state of `M`**: The dictionary `M` contains keys that are unique numbers from the list `N` (or -1) that are greater than `cur`, and their values are either 1 or the count of occurrences of those numbers in `N`.

Given this information, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of the variable `k`, which will take on the value of each key in `M` during each iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the set of keys in the dictionary `M`.

**State: **`k` is one of the keys in the dictionary `M`**
