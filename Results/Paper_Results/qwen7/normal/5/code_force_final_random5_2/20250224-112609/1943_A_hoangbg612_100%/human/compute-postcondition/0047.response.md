Output State: **`k` is one of the keys in the dictionary `M`; `M[k]` is 1; `cnt` is a list containing the element `k`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. Since `k` is initially one of the keys in the dictionary `M` and `M[k]` is 1, after executing `cnt.append(k)`, `cnt` will contain `k` as its first (and only) element. All other conditions remain unchanged.
