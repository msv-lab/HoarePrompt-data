Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), and an array a of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. For each test case, it returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with specific parameters and an array. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case according to the defined conditions.
