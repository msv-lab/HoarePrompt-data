Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `N` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, `num` is the next element in the list `N`, and `M[cur]` is updated to track the count of `cur`.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged. `N` is still a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, `num` remains the next element in the list `N`, and `M[cur]` is updated to track the count of `cur`.
