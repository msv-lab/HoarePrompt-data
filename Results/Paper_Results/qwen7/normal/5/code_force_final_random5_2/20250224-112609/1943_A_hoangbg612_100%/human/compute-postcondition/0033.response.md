Output State: **`cur` is an integer increased by 1, `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list with at least two fewer elements, and `M` is a dictionary, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no loop or conditional statement is specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that the execution would exit the current loop or conditional block. All other variables retain their initial states.
