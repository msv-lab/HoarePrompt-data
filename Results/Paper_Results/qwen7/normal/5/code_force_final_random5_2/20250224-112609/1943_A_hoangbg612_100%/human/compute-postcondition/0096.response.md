Output State: **`N` is not empty, `cur` is num, and `M[cur]` is 1.**

The code `M[cur] = 1` updates the value of `M[cur]` to 1. Since the initial state already mentioned that `M[cur]` remains 1, the value of `M[cur]` is explicitly set to 1 again. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
