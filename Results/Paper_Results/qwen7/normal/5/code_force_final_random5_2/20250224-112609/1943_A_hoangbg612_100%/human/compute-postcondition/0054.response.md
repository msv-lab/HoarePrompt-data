Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `k` (which iterates over the keys of the dictionary `M`) and the dictionary `M` itself.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more keys in the dictionary `M` that have not been processed yet.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `k` is the next key in the dictionary `M`.
   - `M` is the same dictionary.
   - If `M[k]` equals 1, then `k` is appended to the list `cnt`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - After processing the current key `k`, the next key `k` in the dictionary `M` will be the one that follows the current `k`.
   - The dictionary `M` remains unchanged.
   - The condition for appending `k` to `cnt` is based on the value of `M[k]`. If `M[k]` was 1, `k` would have been appended to `cnt` during the previous iteration, but this does not affect the next iteration's state directly.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the dictionary `M` remains unchanged, it does not need to be adjusted.
   - The next key `k` in the dictionary `M` will be the one that follows the current `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`k` is the next key in the dictionary `M`, `M` is the same dictionary**
