Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `cnt` is a list, `S` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `S = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `S`. This does not affect the values of `T` or `cnt`. Therefore, `T` remains as `T-1` and `cnt` remains as it was before, either with its original elements or without changes if it did not meet the condition to assign a new value to `cur`.
