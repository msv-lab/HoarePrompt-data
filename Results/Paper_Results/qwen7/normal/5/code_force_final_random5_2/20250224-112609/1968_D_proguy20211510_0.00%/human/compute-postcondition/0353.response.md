Output State: **`foundb` is `True`, `founds` is `False`, `i` is 4, `b` contains `[a[pb - 1]]`, `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa` since `founds` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Since `founds` is `False`, `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
