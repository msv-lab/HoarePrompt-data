Output State: **`i` is within the range of `range(len(pres))` and equals `i + 1`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `ptsb` is updated to include the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is unchanged and now contains the value `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` to the list `ptsb`. The other variables remain unchanged with their respective values.
