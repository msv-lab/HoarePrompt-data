Output State: `i` is `12 + len(pres)`, `k` is an input integer, `rem` is `k - (12 + len(pres) - 1)`, `ptsb` is a list containing the sum of `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` from 12 to `12 + len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` is a list containing the sum of `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` from 12 to `12 + len(pres) - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the length of the `pres` list plus 11 (since it starts at 12). The variable `k` remains as the input integer. The `rem` variable will be `k - (12 + len(pres) - 1)`. The `ptsb` list will contain the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each index `i` from 12 to the end of the `pres` list. Similarly, the `ptss` list will contain the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each index `i` from 12 to the end of the `pres` list.
