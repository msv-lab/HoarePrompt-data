The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no specific loop context is provided, we assume the `continue` statement is within a loop that iterates over the list `a`. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop, nor does it modify the values of `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]`, which are already set to `maxa`.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`. The current value of `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.**
