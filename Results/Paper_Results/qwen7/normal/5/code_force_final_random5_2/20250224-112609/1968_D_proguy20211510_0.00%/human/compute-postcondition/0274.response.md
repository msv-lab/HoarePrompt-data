Output State: **`i` is within the range of `range(len(pres))`; `rem` is `k - (i + 1)'; `ptsb` is appended with the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`; `ptss` is appended with the value `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptss`. This new value is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, where `rem` is defined as `k - (i + 1)`. The values of `i`, `rem`, `ptsb`, `pres`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `ptsb` and `ptss` have been updated with their respective new values.
