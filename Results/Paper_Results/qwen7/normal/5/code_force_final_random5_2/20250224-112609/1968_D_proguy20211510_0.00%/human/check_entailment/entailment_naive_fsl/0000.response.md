Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where the players' scores can be influenced by their moves according to the permutation rules. The program incorrectly assumes that the maximum score for each player is determined solely by the initial position and the maximum value in the array `a`. However, the players can move to different positions based on the permutation `p`, which affects their final scores.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
In this case, the permutation `p` is `[4, 1, 2, 3]` and the array `a` is `[7, 2, 5, 6]`. According to the problem description, the players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation. The program does not account for these possible moves, leading to incorrect results.

To correctly simulate the game, the program needs to consider all possible moves for each player over the `k` turns, which is not implemented in the given solution. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
