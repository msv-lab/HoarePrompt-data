Output: **Draw**

Explanation:
- `i` is calculated as `12 + len(pres)`. Since the value of `i` itself is not needed to determine the output of the print statement, we do not need to know the exact length of `pres`.
- `k` is an input integer, but its value is not required to determine the output.
- `rem` is calculated as `k - (12 + len(pres) - 1)`, but again, the value of `rem` is not needed for the print statement.
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. The relationship between `maxs` and `maxb` is mentioned, but it does not affect the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'`, regardless of the values of the other variables.
