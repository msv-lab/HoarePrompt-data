Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the expression `len(s)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `len(s)`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 8.
   - `sb` is `preb + b[6]`.
   - `pres` is a list with the element `ss + s[7]`.
   - `ss` is `ss + s[8]`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(s)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(s)`.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `i` was 8 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 9. Additionally, `len(s)` remains unchanged as it is a property of the string `s` and does not change within the loop.

5. **Construct the New State**: The new state should reflect these adjustments.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 9, `sb` is `preb + b[6]`, `pres` is a list with the element `ss + s[7]`, `ss` is `ss + s[8]`**
