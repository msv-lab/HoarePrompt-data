Output State: **`founds` is False, `foundb` is True, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, `s` contains the element `a[ps - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the element `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. The values of `founds`, `foundb`, `i`, `k`, and the content of `b` remain unchanged from the initial state. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 since the operation is typically part of a loop or sequence of operations where `i` is tracking an index or iteration count.
