Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing four elements where the first three elements are the same as before and the fourth element is `a[pb - 1]` if `foundb` is `True` or `a[pb - 1]` (since `foundb` is `True`), `s` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - 6) * maxa` and the second element is `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` is appended to `s` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `founds` is `True` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `False`, `foundb` is `True` if `a[pb - 1] == (k - 6) * maxa` or `False`, `i` is 6, and `k` must be greater than 3. If `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
