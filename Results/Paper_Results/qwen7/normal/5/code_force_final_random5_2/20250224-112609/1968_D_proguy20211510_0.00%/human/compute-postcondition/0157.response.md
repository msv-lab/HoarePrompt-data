Output State: **`p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by space, `maxs` is the maximum value of `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value of `ptsb`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `ptsb` is calculated as the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` is calculated as the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for all `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input split by space, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input split by space, `pb` is an integer from the third part of the input split by space, `ps` is an integer from the fourth part of the input split by space, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by space, `maxa` is the maximum value of `a`, and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but instead moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, all the previous states remain unchanged.
