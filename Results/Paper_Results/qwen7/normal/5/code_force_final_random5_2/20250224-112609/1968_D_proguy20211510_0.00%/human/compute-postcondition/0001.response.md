Output State: **t is a positive integer, YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is a constant used in modular arithmetic to prevent integer overflow. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `YES`, or `NO`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged, and only `MOD` is updated with the specific value.
