Output State: **`i` is within the range of `range(len(pres))` and equals `i + 1`; `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `ptsb` is updated with the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`; `ptss` is unchanged, `ptss` now contains the value `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` to the list `ptss`. Since `i` is within the range of `range(len(pres))` and equals `i + 1`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, and `ptsb` is updated with the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, these values remain unchanged. The only new value added to `ptss` is `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`.
