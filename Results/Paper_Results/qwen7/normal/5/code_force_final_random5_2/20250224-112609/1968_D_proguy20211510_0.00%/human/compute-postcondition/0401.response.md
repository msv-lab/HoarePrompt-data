Output State: **`i` is 10; `sb` is `preb[0] + b[6] + b[9] + b[10]`; `pres` is a list with the elements `ss + s[7]` and `ss + s[9]`; `ss` is `ss + s[9]`; `preb` is a list with the element `preb[0] + b[6] + b[9] + b[10] + b[10]`; `sb` is `preb[0] + b[6] + b[9] + b[10] + b[i]`**

Explanation: 
- The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 10.
- The variable `sb` is updated by adding `b[i]`, which is `b[10]`, to its current value. So, `sb` becomes `preb[0] + b[6] + b[9] + b[10] + b[10]`.
- The other variables (`pres`, `ss`, and `preb`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
