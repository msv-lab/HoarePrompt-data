Output State: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the input integer or updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing four elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `a[pb - 1]` or `a[ps - 1]`, the previous element of `b`, and the new element `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list containing three elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`, and the additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `founds` and `foundb` are `False`, `i` is 4, and `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa` if `founds` is `True`, otherwise `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code `pb = p[pb - 1]` updates the value of `pb` to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still the input integer decremented by 1, `k` remains greater than 0, `ps` is still the input integer or updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `a` remains a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` remains the maximum value in list `a`, `b` and `s` remain as defined, and `founds` and `foundb` remain `False`. The value of `i` remains 4, and `a[pb - 1]` is still equal to `maxa` if `founds` is `True`, otherwise `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.
