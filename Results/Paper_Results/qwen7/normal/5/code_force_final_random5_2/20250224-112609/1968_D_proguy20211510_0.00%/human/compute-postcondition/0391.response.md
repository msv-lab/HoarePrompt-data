Output State: **`i` is 7; `sb` is `preb + b[6]`**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` increments `sb` by the value of `b[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 7, the code effectively adds `b[6]` to `sb`. Since `preb` is defined as `sb + b[i-1]` and `i` is 7, `preb` is equivalent to `sb + b[6]`. Therefore, after the code execution, `sb` is updated to `preb + b[6]`.
