Output State: **`founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with three elements where the first is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, the second is the original element, and the third is `maxa`, `s` contains `a[ps - 1]` and `s` has appended `a[ps - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. Since `s` originally contained `a[ps - 1]`, after appending, `s` now contains `a[ps - 1]` twice. However, since the initial state only specifies that `s` contains `a[ps - 1]`, we can conclude that `s` has appended `a[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
