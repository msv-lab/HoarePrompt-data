Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and the second element is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]` or `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]` depending on the value of `foundb`, `s` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is either `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`, `founds` is `True` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `False`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is 2, and `k` must be greater than 0.
