Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` is 0, `pb` is either the input integer or updated to `p[pb - 1]` multiple times, `ps` is the input integer or updated to `p[ps - 1]` multiple times, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing up to six elements depending on the conditions inside the loop, `s` is a list containing up to six elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`, and the additional elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`. `founds` and `foundb` are either both `True` or both `False`, `i` is 6, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    preb.append(sb + b[i])
    sb += b[i]
    pres.append(ss + s[i])
    ss += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 8; `sb` is `preb + b[6]`; `pres` is a list with the element `ss + s[7]`; `ss` is `ss + s[8]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 9; `sb` is `preb[0] + b[6] + b[9]`; `pres` is a list with the elements `ss + s[7]` and `ss + s[9]`; `ss` is `ss + s[9]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 10; `sb` is `preb[0] + b[6] + b[9] + b[10] + b[10]`; `pres` is a list with the elements `ss + s[7]`, `ss + s[9]`, and `ss + s[10]`; `ss` is `ss + s[9] + s[10]`; `preb` is a list with the element `preb[0] + b[6] + b[9] + b[10] + b[10]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
