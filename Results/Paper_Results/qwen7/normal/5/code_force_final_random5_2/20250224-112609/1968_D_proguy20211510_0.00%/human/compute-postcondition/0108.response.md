Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`; `sb` is `sb + b[i]`; `pres` is `pres + [ss + s[i]]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `pres`. The new element is a list containing the concatenation of `ss` and `s[i]`. The values of `i`, `sb`, and `ss` remain unchanged from their initial states.
