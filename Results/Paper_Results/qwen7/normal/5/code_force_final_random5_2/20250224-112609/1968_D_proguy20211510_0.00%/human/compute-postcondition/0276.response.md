Output State: **`i` is within the range of `range(len(pres))` and equals `i + 1`; `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`; `ptsb` is appended with the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`; `ptss` is appended with the value `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rem` to be `k - (i + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
