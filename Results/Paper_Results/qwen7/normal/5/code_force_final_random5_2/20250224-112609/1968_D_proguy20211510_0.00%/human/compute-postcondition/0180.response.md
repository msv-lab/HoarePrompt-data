Output State: **`founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, and the element at index `pb - 1` of list `a` is appended to list `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `pb - 1` of list `a` to list `b`. The values of `founds`, `foundb`, `i`, `k`, and `maxa` remain unchanged. The precondition that the element at index `pb - 1` of list `a` is not equal to `maxa` is still valid.
