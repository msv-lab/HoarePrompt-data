Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(len(pres)):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(pres)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - Initially, `i` is `-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if `i` is less than `len(pres)`.
   - Since `i` starts at `-1`, the loop will execute as long as `len(pres)` is greater than `-1`, which is always true because `len(pres)` is a non-negative integer (length of a list).

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing.
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to `0` to start the loop.
   - The length of `pres` (`len(pres)`) should be at least `1` for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `0`.
- `len(pres)` must be at least `1`.

State: **`i` is 0, `len(pres)` must be at least 1**
