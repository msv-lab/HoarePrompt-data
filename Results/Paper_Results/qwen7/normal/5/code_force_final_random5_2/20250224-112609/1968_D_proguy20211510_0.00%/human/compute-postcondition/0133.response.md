Output State: **`i` is 4, `rem` is `k - i - 2`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0] + (preb[3] + rem * b[3]) + preb[4] + rem * b[4]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`, `pres` now has an additional element `pres[4] + rem * s[4]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptsb`. The new value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, which translates to `preb[4] + rem * b[4]` since `i` is 4. This new value is added to the existing elements in `ptsb`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the list `pres` gains a new element `pres[4] + rem * s[4]`.
