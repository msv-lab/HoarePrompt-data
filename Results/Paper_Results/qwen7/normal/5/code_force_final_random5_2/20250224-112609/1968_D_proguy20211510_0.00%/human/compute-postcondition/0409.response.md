Output State: **`i` is 12, `k` is an input integer, `rem` is `k - 13`, `ptsb` has an element equal to `preb[12] + (k - 13) * b[12]`, `ptss` is a list with one element equal to `pres[12] + rem * s[12]`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ptss`. This new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, where `i` is 12, `rem` is `k - 13`, and `s[i]` is `s[12]`. Since `i` is 12, the updated state includes `ptss` having one additional element which is the result of the calculation. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
