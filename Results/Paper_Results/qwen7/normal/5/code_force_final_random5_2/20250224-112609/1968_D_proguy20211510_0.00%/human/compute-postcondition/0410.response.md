Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(len(pres)):` statement. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(pres)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 12
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `rem` is `k - 13`
   - `ptsb` has an element equal to `preb[12] + (k - 13) * b[12]`
   - `ptss` is a list with one element equal to `pres[12] + rem * s[12]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 12. For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 13.
   - The other variables (`k`, `rem`, `ptsb`, and `ptss`) are not affected by the loop itself and remain the same unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not given here.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State: **`i` is 13, `k` is an input integer, `rem` is `k - 13`, `ptsb` has an element equal to `preb[12] + (k - 13) * b[12]`, `ptss` is a list with one element equal to `pres[12] + rem * s[12]`**
