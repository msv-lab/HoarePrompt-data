Output State: **`i` is 9; `sb` is `preb[0] + b[6] + b[9]`; `pres` is a list with the elements `ss + s[7]` and `ss + s[9]`; `ss` is `ss + s[9]`**.

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments the value of `ss` by the value of `s[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 9, `ss` is updated to `ss + s[9]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
