Output State: **`i` is within the range of `range(len(pres))`; `rem` is `k - (i + 1)'; `ptsb` is appended with the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptsb`. This value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, where `i` is within the specified range and `rem` is defined as `k - (i + 1)`. The values of `i` and `rem` remain unchanged, but `ptsb` now includes the newly computed value.
