Output State: `i` is `-1`; `sb` is the sum of all elements in list `b`; `pres` is a list containing the sum of all elements in list `s` repeated `k` times; `ss` is the sum of all elements in list `s` multiplied by `k`; `preb` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in list `b` up to that point.

In more detail:
- The variable `i` starts at `k - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it becomes `-1`.
- `sb` accumulates the sum of all elements in list `b` as the loop iterates through all indices of `s`.
- `pres` and `ss` both accumulate the sum of all elements in list `s`, with each element added `k` times to `pres` and `ss` respectively.
- `preb` contains the cumulative sums of elements in list `b` for each iteration, starting from the last element of `b` and adding the next element in each subsequent iteration until all elements of `b` are included.
