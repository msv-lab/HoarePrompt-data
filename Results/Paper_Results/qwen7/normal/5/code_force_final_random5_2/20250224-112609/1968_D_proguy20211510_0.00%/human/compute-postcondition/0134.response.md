Output State: **`i` is 4, `rem` is `k - i - 2`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0] + (preb[3] + rem * b[3]) + preb[4] + rem * b[4]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`, `pres` now has an additional element `pres[4] + rem * s[4]`, and `ptss` has an additional element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` to the list `ptss`. Given that `i` is 4, the new element added to `ptss` is `pres[4] + rem * s[4]`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
