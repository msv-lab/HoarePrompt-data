Output State: **`i` is `k + 3`, `sb` is `sb + b[k] + b[k + 2]`, `pres` is `[pres[0], ss + s[k + 3]]`, `ss` is `ss + s[k + 3] + s[k + 3]`, `preb` is `[sb + b[k + 2], sb + b[k + 2] + b[k + 3]]**.

Explanation: The code appends `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Given that `i` is `k + 3`, `sb + b[i]` becomes `sb + b[k + 3]`. Therefore, `preb` is updated to include this new value, making it `[sb + b[k + 2], sb + b[k + 2] + b[k + 3]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
