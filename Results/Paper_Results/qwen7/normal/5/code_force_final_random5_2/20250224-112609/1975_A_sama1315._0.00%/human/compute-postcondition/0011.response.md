Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2*n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_1(arr)` to the variable `result`. The function `func_1` is applied to the list `arr`, which is defined as a slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index`. The value of `index` is updated to `index + 2*n`. The initial state of `data` and the calculation of `arr` remain unchanged except for the assignment of `result`.
