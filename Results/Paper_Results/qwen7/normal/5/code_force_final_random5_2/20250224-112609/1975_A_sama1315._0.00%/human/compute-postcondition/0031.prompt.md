You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array a. The following n integers represent the elements of array a, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(arr)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 3 * n + 2 + n`, `t` is `t - 3`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration, with a total length of `t` (initial value of `t` minus 3).
    #
    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `index` will be at the position right after the last processed array, `t` will have been decremented by the total number of iterations (which is 3), and `results` will contain the outcomes of applying `func_1` to each of the arrays processed during the loop iterations.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the results of func_1(arr) for each iteration, separated by newlines
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of an array `a`, and then `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n) representing the elements of array `a`. The function processes each set and returns a result for each based on the given data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
