Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` (which is `data[0]` since `index` is 0) to `t`. After this assignment, `index` is incremented by 1 due to the way list indexing works in Python, making it 1. The value of `t` is converted to an integer from the string `data[0]`. The state of `data` remains unchanged.
