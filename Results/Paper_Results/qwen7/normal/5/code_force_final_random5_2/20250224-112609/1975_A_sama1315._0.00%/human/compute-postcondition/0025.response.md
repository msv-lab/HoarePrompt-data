Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 3 * n + 2 + n`, `n` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `arr` is updated to be `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `t` is `t - 2`**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `result` by calling the function `func_1(arr)` with the current value of `arr`. However, since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The output state includes all the variables from the initial state, noting that `result` now holds the return value of `func_1(arr)`, and `results` has an additional element, which is `result`.
