Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. 

- `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order but does not handle the case where the array can be split and swapped to achieve this order.
- `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1`, but `func_1` itself is flawed.

To illustrate, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. According to the problem description, this array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. Specifically, we can split it into `[1, 1, 4, 5]` and `[1, 4]`, and then swap them to get `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, which is not sorted. However, the function `func_1` would incorrectly return 'Yes' because it only checks if the array is already sorted, not if it can be made sorted through the specified operations.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
