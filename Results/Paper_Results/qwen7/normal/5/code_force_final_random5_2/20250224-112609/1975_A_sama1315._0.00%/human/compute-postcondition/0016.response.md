Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2 * n + 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`, `t` is t - 1, `arr` is updated to be a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`**.

Explanation:
- The code updates `arr` to be a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]` using the `map` function and `int`. This means `arr` now contains integers from the specified slice of `data`.
- All other variables (`data`, `index`, `results`, `n`, `t`, `result`, and the previous state of `arr`) remain unchanged except for `arr` which is updated.
