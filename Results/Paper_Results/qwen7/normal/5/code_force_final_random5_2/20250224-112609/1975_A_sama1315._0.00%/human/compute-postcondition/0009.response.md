Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 1 + n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by converting elements from `data` starting at `index` and ending at `index + n`. The value of `index` is updated to `index + 1 + n`. The value of `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, but since the exact value of `data[index]` is not specified, we express the new value of `index` as `index + 1 + n`. The state of `data` remains unchanged, and `arr` is now a list of integers extracted from the specified slice of `data`.
