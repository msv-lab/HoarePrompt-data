Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 3 * n + 2`, `n` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[index - 1:index + n + 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `t` is `t - 2`**.

Explanation: The line `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was set to `index + 3 * n + 1`. After incrementing, `index` becomes `index + 3 * n + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state.
