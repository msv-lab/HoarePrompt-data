### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if the given array `arr` is already non-decreasing.
   - If the array is non-decreasing, it returns 'No'.
   - If the array is not non-decreasing, it returns 'Yes'.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It should return 'Yes' if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing, but it currently just checks if the array is non-decreasing or not.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It then processes each array using `func_1`.
   - The results of `func_1` for each test case are stored in a list and printed at the end.

3. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The goal is to determine if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle this requirement. It only checks if the array is already non-decreasing.

### Conclusion:
- Since `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing, the overall program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
