Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers of length n where 2 <= n <= 50 and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_1(arr):
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) :
        return 'Yes'
        #The program returns 'Yes'
    #State: arr is a list of positive integers of length n where 2 <= n <= 50 and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, and there exists at least one index i such that arr[i] > arr[i + 1]
    return 'No' if any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) else 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'No' if there are no elements in the list `arr` such that `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]` for any `i` in the range from 0 to `len(arr) - 2`, otherwise it returns 'Yes'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `arr` with a length between 2 and 50, inclusive, where each element is between 1 and 10^6, inclusive. It checks whether the list is non-decreasing (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next element). If the list is non-decreasing, it returns 'No'; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array a. The following n integers represent the elements of array a, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(arr)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 3 * n + 2 + n`, `t` is `t - 3`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration, with a total length of `t` (initial value of `t` minus 3).
    #
    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `index` will be at the position right after the last processed array, `t` will have been decremented by the total number of iterations (which is 3), and `results` will contain the outcomes of applying `func_1` to each of the arrays processed during the loop iterations.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the results of func_1(arr) for each iteration, separated by newlines
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set contains an integer `n` indicating the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of `a`. For each set, it calls another function `func_1` to process the array and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case, separated by new lines.
