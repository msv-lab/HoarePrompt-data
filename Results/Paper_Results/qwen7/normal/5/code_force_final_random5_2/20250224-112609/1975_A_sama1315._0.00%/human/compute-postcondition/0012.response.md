Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2*n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` adds the value of `result` to the list `results`. The values of `data`, `index`, `arr`, and `result` remain as they were before this line of code was executed, except that `index` is updated to `index + 2*n`.
