Based on the initial state described:

- `data` is unchanged.
- `index` is set to `index + 3 * n + 2 + n`, which simplifies to `index + 4 * n + 2`.
- `t` is set to `t - 3`.
- `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration, with a total length of `t` (initial value of `t` minus 3).

The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will join all elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). 

Given that `results` contains the outcomes of applying `func_1` to each of the arrays processed during the loop iterations, and the length of `results` is `t - 3`, the printed output will be a series of lines, each containing the result of `func_1(arr)` for one of the processed arrays.

Output: **the results of func_1(arr) for each iteration, separated by newlines**
