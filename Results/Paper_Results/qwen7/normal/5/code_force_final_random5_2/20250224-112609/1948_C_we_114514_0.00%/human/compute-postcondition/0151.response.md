Output State: **reachable_first_row is False, reachable_second_row is True, n must be greater than 0, j is n - 1, and the current value of j is less than n - 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. All other variables (`reachable_first_row`, `n`, `j`, and the condition about `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
