Output State: **reachable_first_row is a boolean value, reachable_second_row is True, n must be greater than 0, and j is n.**

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. Since the initial state specified that `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are both boolean values, and no other changes were made to `reachable_first_row`, its value remains unchanged. The conditions for `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` being both True or one becoming False based on the values of `row1[j]` and `row2[j]` are not triggered by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `reachable_second_row` is now explicitly set to `True`. The other conditions (n > 0 and j = n) remain as per the initial state.
