Postcondition: `reachable_first_row` is True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is equal to `n-1`. If `j` equals `n-1`, the conditions of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. If `j` does not equal `n-1`, the conditions of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged, and if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>',` then the condition remains unchanged.
