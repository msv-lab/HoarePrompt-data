Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). However, the logic within the `func_1` function has some flaws that need to be addressed:

1. **Initialization of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`:**
   - The initial value of `reachable_first_row` is set to `True`, which means the robot can start from the first row.
   - The initial value of `reachable_second_row` is set to `False`, which is correct.

2. **Logic for moving from the first row to the second row:**
   - The code checks if the current cell in `row1` is `'>`' and if it is the last column. If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If the current cell in `row1` is `'<'`, it immediately sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` and checks if the next cell in `row2` is `'>`' to set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

3. **Final check for reaching the second row:**
   - After the loop, the function checks if `reachable_second_row` is `True` and appends the appropriate result ('YES' or 'NO') to the `results` list.

However, the logic for transitioning from the first row to the second row is flawed. Specifically:
- The condition `if j == n - 1:` is too restrictive. The robot should be able to move to the second row if it reaches a cell with `'>`' in `row1` at any point, not just the last column.
- The immediate transition from `reachable_first_row` to `reachable_second_row` when encountering a `'<'` in `row1` is also incorrect because the robot must continue moving according to the direction in `row2`.

To fix this, the logic should allow the robot to move to the second row whenever it encounters a `'>`' in `row1` and ensure that it continues to follow the direction in `row2` until it reaches the end of the row.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **False**
