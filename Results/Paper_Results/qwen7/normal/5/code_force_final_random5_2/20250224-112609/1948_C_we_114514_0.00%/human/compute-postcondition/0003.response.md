Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is True, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `row1` is the second element of `test_case` which is a tuple, `row2` is the third element of `test_case` which is a tuple.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `reachable_first_row`. This assignment does not affect the values of `results`, `n`, `row1`, or `row2`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
