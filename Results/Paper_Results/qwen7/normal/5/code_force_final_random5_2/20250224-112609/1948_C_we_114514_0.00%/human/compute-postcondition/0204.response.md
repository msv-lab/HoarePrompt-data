Output State: **reachable_first_row is a boolean value, reachable_second_row is False, results is ['NO'], and n is equal to n.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`. Since `results` was not defined before, it is initialized as a list containing 'NO'. The values of `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
