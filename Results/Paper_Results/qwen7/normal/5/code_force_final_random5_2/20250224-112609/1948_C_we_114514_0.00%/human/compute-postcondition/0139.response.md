Output State: **reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False, n is equal to n, (row1, row2) from test_case, j is equal to n - 1, and results contains either 'YES' or ['NO'] depending on the conditions met within the loop, and test_case is the next test case in test_cases**.

The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
