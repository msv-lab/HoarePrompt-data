Output State: reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is True, n is test_case[0], and j is equal to n - 1.

After the loop executes all its iterations, the following conditions hold:
- `reachable_first_row` remains True because it was not set to False within the loop's body.
- `reachable_second_row` remains True because it was set to True and no condition within the loop body changed it to False.
- `n` remains as `test_case[0]` since it is not modified within the loop.
- `j` is equal to `n - 1` after the last iteration of the loop.
