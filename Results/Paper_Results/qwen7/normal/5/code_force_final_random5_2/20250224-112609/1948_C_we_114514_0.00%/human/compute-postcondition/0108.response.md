Output State: **reachable_first_row is True or False, reachable_second_row is True, n must be greater than 0, and j is equal to n.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `reachable_first_row`, `n`, or `j`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
