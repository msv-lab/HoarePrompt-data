Output State: **reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is True, n must be greater than 0, j is n**

The code simply reassigns `reachable_second_row` to `True`, which does not affect the values of `reachable_first_row`, `n`, or `j`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values from the initial state.
