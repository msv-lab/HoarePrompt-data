Output State: **`reachable_second_row` is `True`, `reachable_first_row` remains `True` if `row1[j+1] == '>'`, otherwise it is `False`, and `j` is `j + 1`**.

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = True` sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. The values of `reachable_first_row` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.
