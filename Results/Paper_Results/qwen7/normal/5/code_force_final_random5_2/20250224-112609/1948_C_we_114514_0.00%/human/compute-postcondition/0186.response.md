Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n + 1`**

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_first_row` to `False`. The values of `reachable_second_row`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `reachable_second_row` is still `True`, `n` is still greater than 0, and `j` is still `n + 1`.
