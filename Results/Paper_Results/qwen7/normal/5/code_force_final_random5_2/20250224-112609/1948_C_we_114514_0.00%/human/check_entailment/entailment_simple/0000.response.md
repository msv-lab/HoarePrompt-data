Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid configuration. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads the dimensions (`n`) and the two rows of arrows (`row1` and `row2`). This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the outcomes for each test case.
   - For each test case, it sets initial flags `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to `True` and `False`, respectively.
   - It iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If the robot is still in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`), it checks the direction of the arrow:
       - If the arrow points right (`>`), the robot moves to the next column in the same row. If it reaches the last column, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
       - If the arrow points left (`<`), the robot moves to the corresponding column in the second row. If this column exists and the arrow points right, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If the robot has already reached the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`), it checks the direction of the arrow in the second row:
       - If the arrow points right (`>`), the robot moves to the next column in the same row. If it reaches the last column, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - After processing all columns for a test case, it appends `'YES'` to `results` if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, otherwise it appends `'NO'`.

4. **Final Return**:
   - The function returns the `results` list, which contains the outcome for each test case.

Given the provided code, it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. There are no logical errors or missing steps that would cause the program to fail in determining the correct outcome for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
