Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is True if every character in `row1` from index 0 to `n-2` is not '>', and the last character (`row1[n-1]`) is '>', otherwise it is False; `reachable_second_row` is True; the value of `j` is `n - 1`; `results` list now contains 'YES'.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. This does not affect the values of `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, or `j`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values. The only change is that `results` now includes the string `'YES'`.
