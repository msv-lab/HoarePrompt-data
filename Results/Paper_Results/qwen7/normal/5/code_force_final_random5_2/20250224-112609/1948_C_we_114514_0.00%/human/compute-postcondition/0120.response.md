Output State: **reachable_first_row is False, reachable_second_row is True**

The code simply reassigns the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`, which does not affect the value of `reachable_first_row`. The initial state of `n` being greater than 0 and `j` being equal to `n` remains unchanged.
