Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `row1` is the second element of `test_case` which is a tuple, `row2` is the third element of `test_case` which is a tuple.**

Explanation: The code unpacks the `test_case` tuple into three variables: `n`, `row1`, and `row2`. `n` is assigned the first element of `test_case`, `row1` is assigned the second element (a tuple), and `row2` is assigned the third element (another tuple). The `results` list remains unchanged as it was initially empty.
