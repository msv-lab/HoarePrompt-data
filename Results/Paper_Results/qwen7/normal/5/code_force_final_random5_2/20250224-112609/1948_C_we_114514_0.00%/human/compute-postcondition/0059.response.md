Output State: `reachable_first_row` is True if `row1[n-1] == '>'`, otherwise it is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `j` equals `n - 1`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `reachable_second_row` remains True because there is no condition that can make it False. The value of `reachable_first_row` depends on the last element of `row1`; if `row1[n-1] == '>', reachable_first_row is True, otherwise it is False. The variable `j` will be set to `n - 1` after the loop completes, as it is updated at the end of each iteration without any decrement that would bring it below `n-1`.
