Output State: **reachable_first_row is True, results is an empty list, reachable_second_row is False, n is the first element of test_case, row1 is the second element of test_case which is a tuple, row2 is the third element of test_case which is a tuple.**

The variable `reachable_second_row` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables (`reachable_first_row`, `results`, `n`, `row1`, and `row2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
