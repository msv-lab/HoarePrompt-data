You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

    >><<><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:

    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, (row1, row2)))
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and two strings of length `n`, consisting only of '<' and '>' characters. It returns a list called `results` that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether `reachable_second_row` became True for that specific test case. The length of the list matches the number of test cases in `test_cases`. For each test case, the function checks if it's possible to reach the second row from the first row following the directions given by the strings `row1` and `row2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4
4
<>><
><>>
```

The program's output for this input is `NO`, but according to the problem description, the robot should be able to reach the cell (2, 4) through the following path:
1. Start at (1, 1).
2. Move right to (1, 2).
3. Move left to (1, 1).
4. Move right to (1, 2).
5. Move right to (1, 3).
6. Move right to (1, 4).
7. Move down to (2, 4).

However, the program incorrectly determines that the robot cannot reach (2, 4) because it does not properly account for the possibility of the robot moving back and forth between the two rows. The logic only checks if the current column's arrow points right and if the next column's arrow also points right, which is insufficient for handling all cases, especially when the robot needs to backtrack and move between rows.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for all potential cases.
