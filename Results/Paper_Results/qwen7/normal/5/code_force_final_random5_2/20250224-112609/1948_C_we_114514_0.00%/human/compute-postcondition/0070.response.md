State: **`reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1** 

Explanation:
- The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`.
- The loop condition `for j in range(n)` means that the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.
- Before the loop starts, `reachable_first_row` is True and `reachable_second_row` is False, but these do not affect the loop's execution directly.
- Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and set `j` to 1 (the starting value for the loop).

Note: Since `j` is the loop variable, it typically starts from 0, but for the loop to start executing, `n` must be at least 1. Hence, adjusting `j` to 1 is not necessary; instead, ensuring `n > 0` is sufficient.
