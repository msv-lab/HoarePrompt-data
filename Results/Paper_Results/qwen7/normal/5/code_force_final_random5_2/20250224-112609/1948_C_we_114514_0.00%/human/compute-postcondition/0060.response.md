Output State: `reachable_first_row` is True if `row1[n-1] == '>'`, otherwise it is False. `reachable_second_row` is True. The value of `j` is `n - 1`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `reachable_second_row` remains True because there is no condition that can make it False. For `reachable_first_row`, it will be True if every character in `row1` from index 0 to `n-2` is not '>', and the last character (`row1[n-1]`) is '>'. If any character in `row1` before the last one is '<', or if `row1[n-1]` is '<', then `reachable_first_row` will be False. The value of `j` will be `n - 1` after the loop completes, as it increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`.
