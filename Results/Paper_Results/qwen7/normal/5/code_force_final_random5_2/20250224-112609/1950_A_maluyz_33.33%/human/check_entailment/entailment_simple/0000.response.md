Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The conditions for determining whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither are implemented correctly:
   - For a stair (`a < b < c`), it prints "STAIR".
   - For a peak (`a < b > c`), it prints "PEAK".
   - For any other combination, it prints "NONE".
4. The logic for checking these conditions is sound:
   - The first `if` statement checks for the stair condition.
   - The second `elif` statement checks for the peak condition by ensuring `b` is the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - The final `else` statement handles any other case, which includes when all three digits are equal (`a == b == c`), which should also be considered as "NONE".

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program appears to handle all cases correctly according to the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
