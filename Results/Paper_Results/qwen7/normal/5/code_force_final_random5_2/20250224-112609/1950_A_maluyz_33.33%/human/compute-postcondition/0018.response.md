Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and either `a` is not equal to `b` or `b` is not equal to `c`. Furthermore, `max(a, b, c)` equals `b` if the condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is true; otherwise, `max(a, b, c)` is not equal to `b`.
