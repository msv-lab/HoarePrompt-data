Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and either `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, or `a` is greater than or equal to `b` or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If `a` equals `b` and `b` equals `c`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `b` becomes the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`.
