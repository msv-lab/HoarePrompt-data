Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers entered by the user**.

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
