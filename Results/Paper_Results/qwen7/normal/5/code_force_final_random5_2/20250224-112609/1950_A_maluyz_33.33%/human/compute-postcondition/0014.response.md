Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
- `b` is the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- Either `a` is not equal to `b` or `b` is not equal to `c`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
