You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs `t` times), `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers entered by the user during the last iteration of the loop. If `a < b < c` is true during the last iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` will be equal to the initial input integer, `i` will be `t-1`, and `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last set of inputs provided by the user.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the middle digit `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, which should be considered a "NONE" case according to the problem description. For example, if the input is `3 4 2`, the program incorrectly prints "PEAK" instead of "NONE". This can be verified by considering the following test case:

Input:
```
3 4 2
```

Expected Output:
```
NONE
```

Actual Output:
```
PEAK
```

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
