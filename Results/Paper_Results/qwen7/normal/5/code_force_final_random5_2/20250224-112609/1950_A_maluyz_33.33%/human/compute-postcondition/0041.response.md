Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers entered by the user. If the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is equal to `b`, the program does not change the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
