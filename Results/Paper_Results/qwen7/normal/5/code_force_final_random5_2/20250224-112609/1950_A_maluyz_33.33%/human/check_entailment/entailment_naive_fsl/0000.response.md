Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the middle digit `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, which should be considered a "NONE" case according to the problem description. For example, if the input is `3 4 2`, the program incorrectly prints "PEAK" instead of "NONE". This can be verified by considering the following test case:

Input:
```
3 4 2
```

Expected Output:
```
NONE
```

Actual Output:
```
PEAK
```

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
