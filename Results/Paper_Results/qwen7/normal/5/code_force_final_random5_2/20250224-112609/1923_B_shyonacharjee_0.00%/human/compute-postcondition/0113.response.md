Output State: **`success` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `position` is `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `time_available` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `bullets_needed` is `monsters[i][1]`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + monsters[n][1] + monsters[i][1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `success`, `i`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, `bullets_needed`, and `total_bullets_used`.
