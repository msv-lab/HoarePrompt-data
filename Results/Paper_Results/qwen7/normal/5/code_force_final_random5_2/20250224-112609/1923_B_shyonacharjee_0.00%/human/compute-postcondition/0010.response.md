Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is 0, `positions` is a list of integers, `healths` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `position` is the position of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list.**

The code calculates the absolute value of the position of the first monster in the `monsters` list and assigns it to the variable `distance`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
