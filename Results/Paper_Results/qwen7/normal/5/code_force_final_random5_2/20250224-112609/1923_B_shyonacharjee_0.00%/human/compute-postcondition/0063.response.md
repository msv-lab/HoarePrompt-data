Output State: **`success` is False, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of `position`, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The line `success = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `success`. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their previous values remain unchanged.
