Output State: **`success` is `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `position` is the position from `monsters[i]`, `health` is the health from `monsters[i]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position` from `monsters[i]`, `time_available` is `distance`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All the variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
