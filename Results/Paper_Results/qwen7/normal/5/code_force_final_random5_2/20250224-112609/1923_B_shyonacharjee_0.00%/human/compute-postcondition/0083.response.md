Output State: **`success` is False, `position` is the position of the last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the `position`, `time_available` equals `distance`, `i` is `n-1`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of `bullets_needed` for all iterations, `t` is `n+1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `positions = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer before storing them in the list `positions`. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged.
