Output State: **`success` is False, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of `position`, `i` is 4, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`.**

Explanation: The code `total_bullets_used += bullets_needed` increases the value of `total_bullets_used` by the value of `bullets_needed`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
