Output State: **`success` is `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `position` is `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `time_available` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `bullets_needed` is `monsters[i][1]`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + monsters[i][1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement we were inside. None of the variables are modified by the `break` statement, so their values remain as they were in the initial state.
