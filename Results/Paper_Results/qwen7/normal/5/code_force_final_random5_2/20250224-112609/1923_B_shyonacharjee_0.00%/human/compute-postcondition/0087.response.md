Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - `i` is initialized to `n-1` before the loop starts, but during the first iteration, `i` will be set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is given as an input integer.

3. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - For the first iteration, `i` should be `n-1`, and after the first iteration, `i` will decrement until it is no longer less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being `n-1`, the first iteration will proceed as expected.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is `n-1` and `n` is the correct input integer for the loop to execute properly.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer**
