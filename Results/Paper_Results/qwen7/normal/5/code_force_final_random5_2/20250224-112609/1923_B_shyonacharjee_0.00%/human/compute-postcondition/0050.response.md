Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is 0, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, and `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list; `i` is incremented by 1, and `distance` is now equal to `abs(position)`**.

Explanation: The code `distance = abs(position)` simply updates the value of `distance` to be the absolute value of `position`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
