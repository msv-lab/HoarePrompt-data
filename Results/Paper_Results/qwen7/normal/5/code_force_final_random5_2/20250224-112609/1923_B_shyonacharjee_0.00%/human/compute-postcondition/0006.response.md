Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is 0, `positions` is a list of integers, `healths` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `n` is the first integer input after `t`, `k` is the second integer input after `t`.**

Explanation: The line `total_bullets_used = 0` initializes the variable `total_bullets_used` to 0. This does not affect any other variables or lists. Therefore, the initial states of `positions`, `healths`, `monsters`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
