Output State: **`time_available` is equal to the absolute value of the position of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `positions` is a list of integers, `healths` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `position` is the position of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list.**

Explanation: The line `time_available = distance` assigns the value of `distance` to `time_available`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
