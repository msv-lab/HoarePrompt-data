Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. Additionally, there are two lists of integers a and x, where a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and x contains n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
    positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
    total_bullets_used = 0
    success = True
    for i in range(n):
        position, health = monsters[i]
        distance = abs(position)
        time_available = distance
        bullets_needed = health
        if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
            success = False
            break
        total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
    print('YES' if success else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `success` is False, `total_bullets_used` is equal to the sum of the health of all monsters in the `monsters` list, `positions` is a list of integers, `healths` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `n` is the total number of monsters in the `monsters` list, `k` is the second integer input after `t`, `i` is `n-1`, `position` is the position of the last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster in the `monsters` list, and `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of the position of the last monster in the `monsters` list.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. Given that the loop breaks when `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available`, and since the output state after 3 iterations indicates that `success` is already False, it means the condition was met before completing all iterations. Therefore, the loop does not finish executing all iterations, and `success` remains False. The `total_bullets_used` will be the sum of the healths of all monsters because the loop continues to add the health of each monster to `total_bullets_used` until the condition is no longer satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `success` is False, `position` is the position of the last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the `position`, `time_available` equals `distance`, `i` is `n-1`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of `bullets_needed` for all iterations.

Explanation: The loop iterates through each monster in the `monsters` list. If at any point the total bullets used plus the bullets needed exceed the time available, the loop breaks and sets `success` to False. Since the loop has executed for all `n` iterations, it means the condition was met for at least one monster, hence `success` remains False. The final values of `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, `i`, and `total_bullets_used` correspond to the last monster in the list after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `success` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `position` is `monsters[n][0]`, `health` is `monsters[n][1]`, `distance` is `abs(monsters[n][0])`, `time_available` is `abs(monsters[n][0])`, `bullets_needed` is `monsters[n][1]`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of all `health` values in the `monsters` list.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each monster in the `monsters` list. Since the loop condition is `for i in range(n)`, it will run exactly `n` times. Given that the initial state shows `success` as `False` and does not change within the loop, `success` remains `False` after all iterations. After the loop completes, `i` becomes `n`, and the last executed monster's details (`position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, and `bullets_needed`) are those of the last monster in the list. The `total_bullets_used` is the cumulative sum of all `health` values of the monsters because the loop adds each `bullets_needed` (which is equal to `health`) to `total_bullets_used` without any reduction.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
