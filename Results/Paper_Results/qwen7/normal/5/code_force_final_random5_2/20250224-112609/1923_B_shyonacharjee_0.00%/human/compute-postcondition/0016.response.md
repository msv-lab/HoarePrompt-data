Postcondition: **`success` is False, `bullets_needed` is equal to the health of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of the position of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `positions` is a list of integers, `healths` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `position` is the position of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, and the total bullets used plus the bullets needed is greater than the time available. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
