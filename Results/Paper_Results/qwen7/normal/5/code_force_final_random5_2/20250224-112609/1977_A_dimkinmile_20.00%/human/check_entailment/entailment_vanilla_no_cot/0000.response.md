Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required for the problem. Specifically:

- The function `func_1()` is defined but never called with the appropriate arguments inside the loop where the number of test cases is processed.
- The variable `kreker` is used to read the number of test cases, but this value is not utilized in the loop that processes each test case.
- The function `func_1()` should be called within the loop to process each test case.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
for _ in range(t):  # Loop through each test case
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())  # Read n and m for each test case
    if n >= m:  # Check if it's possible to have m cubes after n moves
        print('Yes')  # Print 'Yes' if possible
    else:
        print('No')  # Print 'No' if not possible
```

This corrected version directly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case appropriately without the need for an unnecessary function call.
