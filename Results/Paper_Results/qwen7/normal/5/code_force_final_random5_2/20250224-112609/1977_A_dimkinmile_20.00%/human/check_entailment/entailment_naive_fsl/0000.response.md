Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program always prints "Yes" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not always true according to the problem description.

For example, consider the test case where `n = 2` and `m = 4`. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, so it is impossible to end up with 4 cubes after 2 moves. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" for this case because `n >= m`.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, as each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (either adding or removing). If the difference is odd, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
