### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program is incorrect due to the lack of proper logic to handle the parity condition. Let's break down the issues and verify the corrected version.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Program:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is not defined and called within the loop, which is incorrect.
2. **Parity Check**: The program does not check if `n - m` is even, which is essential to determine if the desired number of cubes can be achieved.

#### Corrected Program:
The corrected version provided in the original assessment addresses these issues:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Analysis of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` and processes each test case.
2. **Reading Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
3. **Parity Check**: It checks if `(n - m)` is even using the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it means that the difference between `n` and `m` can be achieved by a series of additions and subtractions, hence printing 'Yes'.
   - If the condition is false, it means the difference cannot be achieved, hence printing 'No'.

This logic ensures that the program correctly determines whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the corrected program accurately implements the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues but provided an incorrect solution.

**Final: True**

The given program, when corrected, is now correct.
