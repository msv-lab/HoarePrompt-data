Postcondition: `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta` and is equal to 1, `t` must be at least 1, `n` is equal to the initial value after the loop, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now `n`, `j` is equal to -1, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` where `q[j]` was greater than 0 during the loop's iterations, and the length of `eta` is 1.
