Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `rho` is equal to `rho + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]]`.**

Explanation: The code `rho += q[eta[j]]` increments the value of `rho` by `q[eta[j]]`. Since `j` was already incremented in the previous line (`j` is `j + 1`), it remains unchanged from its previous value. The value of `res` is updated according to the initial state, and `rho` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]]` to its current value.
