Output State: **`eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `t` must be at least 1, `n` is equal to the initial value after the loop, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now `n`, `j` is equal to -1, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` where `q[j]` was greater than 0 during the loop's iterations.**

The code `eta_ln = len(eta)` calculates the length of the list `eta` and assigns it to the variable `eta_ln`. This does not change the values of any other variables or the conditions specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains all the information from the initial state, updating only the value of `eta_ln` to be the length of the list `eta`.
