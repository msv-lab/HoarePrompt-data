Output State: **`j` is 4, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `res` is increased by `q[eta[4]] * (q[eta[4]] - 1) * (q[eta[4]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[4]] * (q[eta[4]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `2 * q[eta[2]] + 2 * q[eta[3]] + q[eta[4]]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `j`, `eta_ln`, `res`, and `rho` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
