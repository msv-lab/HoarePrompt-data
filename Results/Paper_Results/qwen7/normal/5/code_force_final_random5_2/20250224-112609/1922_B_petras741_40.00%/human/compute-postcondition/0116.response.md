Output State: **`j` is 3, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `res` is increased by `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) * (q[eta[3]] - 2) // 6`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[2]] + q[eta[3]] + q[eta[j]]`**

Explanation: The value of `j` remains 3. The value of `eta_ln` remains greater than 1. The value of `res` remains unchanged from its initial calculation. The value of `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`, which is `q[eta[3]]`. Therefore, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[2]] + q[eta[3]] + q[eta[3]]`.
