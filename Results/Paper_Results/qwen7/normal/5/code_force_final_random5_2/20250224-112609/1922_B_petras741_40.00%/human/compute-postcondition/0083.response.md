Output State: **`eta` is an empty list, the loop will have executed `n` times, after all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n-1`, and each element in the list `q` at index `w[j]` where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w`. In other words, `q` will contain the count of each integer present in the list `w`.**

The code initializes an empty list `eta`. The loop and operations involving `j`, `q`, and `w` are not yet executed, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
