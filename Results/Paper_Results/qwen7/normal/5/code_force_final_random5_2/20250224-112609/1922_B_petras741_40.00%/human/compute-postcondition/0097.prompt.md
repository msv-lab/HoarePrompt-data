Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `eta` is an empty list, the loop will have executed `n` times, after all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n-1`, and each element in the list `q` at index `w[j]` where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w`. In other words, `q` will contain the count of each integer present in the list `w`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n + 1):
    if q[j] > 0:
        eta.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is defined and positive. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` is a list containing the value 0. There is no else part in the code, so no additional changes occur if the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is defined and positive, and `eta` is a list containing 1. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then no change is made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is defined and greater than 1, and `eta` is a list containing 1 and 2. If `q[2]` is greater than 0, then `q[2]` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
