Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`, `j` is within the range [1, eta_ln), `eta_ln` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding the value of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to its current value. The value of `j` remains within the range [1, eta_ln) and `eta_ln` remains greater than 1. The value of `q[eta[j]]` is used in the calculation, but since the exact value of `q[eta[j]]` is not specified, it is represented as `q[eta[j]]`.
