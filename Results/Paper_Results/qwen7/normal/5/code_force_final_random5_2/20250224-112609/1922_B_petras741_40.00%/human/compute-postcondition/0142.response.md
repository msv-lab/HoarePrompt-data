Output State: **`j` is 0; `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Since `j` is initially 0 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 0 (though `n` is not directly used in the code), the only variable that changes is `q[w[j]]`, which is incremented by 1 where `w[j]` refers to the element in the list `w` at index `j`. Given `j` is 0, `w[j]` refers to the first element of the list `w`. Therefore, `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1.
