Postcondition: `j` is 4, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `res` is increased by `q[eta[4]] * (q[eta[4]] - 1) * (q[eta[4]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[4]] * (q[eta[4]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `2 * q[eta[2]] + 2 * q[eta[3]] + q[eta[4]]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
