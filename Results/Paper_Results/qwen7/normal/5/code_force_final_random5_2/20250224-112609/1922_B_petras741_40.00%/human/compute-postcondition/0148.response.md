Output State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` will be `n-1`, each element in `q` at index corresponding to elements in `w` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of that index in `w`.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `eta`. The values of `j` and the modifications to `q` based on `w` remain unchanged from the initial state because no operations are performed on `eta`, `j`, or the elements of `q` and `w`.
