Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `n` must be at least 3.
   - `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now 2.
   - `j` is 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - Since `n` is at least 3, the condition `j < n` will still hold true if `j` becomes 3.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `w` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `q` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is updated to 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now 2, `j` is 3**
