Postcondition: **`rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `eta` will be a list containing all indices `j` (from `n-1` down to `0`) for which `q[j]` was greater than 0 at any point during the loop's execution, `j` is `-1`, and `n` must be greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is not equal to 1**
