Output State: **`sub_summ` is 0 + `val_a[0]`, `val_a` must be initialized, `sec_arr` must have at least one element**

Explanation: The value of `sub_summ` is updated by adding the first element of the list `val_a` to its current value. Since `sub_summ` was initially 0, it now becomes `0 + val_a[0]`. The conditions for `val_a` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
