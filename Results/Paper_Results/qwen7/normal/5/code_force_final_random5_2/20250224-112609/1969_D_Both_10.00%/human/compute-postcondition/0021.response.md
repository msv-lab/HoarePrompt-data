Output State: **`sub_summ' is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr` plus the sum of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]`, `main_ar` is a list containing sublists with one less element, `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as there are sublists in `main_ar`, and `val_b` is the first element of the next sublist in `main_ar`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sub_summ` by adding the values of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `sub_summ` now includes these additional values, while `main_ar`, `sec_arr`, and `val_b` retain their original conditions and values.
