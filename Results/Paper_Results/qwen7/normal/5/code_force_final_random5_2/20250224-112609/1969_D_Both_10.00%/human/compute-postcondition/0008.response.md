Output State: `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, with each element added once, `val_a` must be initialized, and `sec_arr` must contain at least as many elements as there are iterations of the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `sub_summ` will hold the total sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`. For example, if `sec_arr` contains `[ (1,), (2,), (3,), ... ]`, then `sub_summ` would be `1 + 2 + 3 + ...` up to the last tuple in `sec_arr`.
