To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_3` aligns with the problem statement and correctly calculates Alice's profit under optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob.

### Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit.
   - Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit.
   - If Alice buys less than `k` items, Bob takes all of them for free.
   - If Alice buys `k` or more items, Bob takes `k` items for free and pays for the rest.

2. **Key Points:**
   - Alice should focus on buying items where the difference `b_i - a_i` is maximized.
   - Bob will strategically choose the `k` most expensive items Alice bought to minimize Alice's profit.

3. **Implementation Review:**
   - The function `func_3` takes two arguments: `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - `main_ar` is expected to be a list of tuples `(a_i, b_i)` representing the prices for Alice and Bob.
   - `sec_arr` is not used in the function, which suggests it might be a mistake or unnecessary.

4. **Logic in `func_3`:**
   ```python
   def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
       sub_summ = 0
       for val_a in sec_arr:
           sub_summ += val_a[0]
       for val_b in main_ar:
           if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
               sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
       return sub_summ
   ```
   - The loop over `sec_arr` is unnecessary and incorrect.
   - The condition `if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:` is not relevant to the problem and does not make sense in this context.

### Correct Approach:
- Sort the items by the difference `b_i - a_i` in descending order.
- Calculate the total cost for Alice if she buys all items.
- Determine the maximum possible profit by considering the optimal strategy for Bob.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func_3(main_ar, k):
    # Calculate the difference b_i - a_i for each item
    differences = [(b - a, i) for i, (a, b) in enumerate(main_ar)]
    
    # Sort the items by the difference in descending order
    differences.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Calculate the total cost for Alice if she buys all items
    total_cost = sum(b for _, b in main_ar)
    
    # Calculate the maximum possible profit
    max_profit = 0
    for diff, idx in differences:
        if k > 0:
            max_profit += diff
            k -= 1
        else:
            break
    
    # Subtract the cost of the k most expensive items Alice bought
    for _, b in main_ar:
        max_profit -= b
    
    return max_profit
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic correctly. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: False**
