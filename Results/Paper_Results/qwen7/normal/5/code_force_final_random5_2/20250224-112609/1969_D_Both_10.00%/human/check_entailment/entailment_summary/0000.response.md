Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves a strategic game between Alice and Bob. Alice selects a subset of items to buy, and Bob either takes all of them for free if Alice buys fewer than \(k\) items, or he takes \(k\) items for free and Alice sells the remaining items to him at their respective prices.

2. **Key Points to Validate**:
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit.
   - Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit.
   - The solution involves sorting and using a min-heap to manage the items optimally.
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_2` reads the values for \(n\), \(k\), \(a\), and \(b\).
   - `func_3` calculates the sum based on the given logic.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code correctly initializes variables and reads input using the provided functions.
   - It sorts the items based on \(b_i\) (Bob's price).
   - It uses a heap to keep track of the items that Bob might take for free.
   - It iterates through the sorted items, updating the sum of profits and managing the heap accordingly.
   - The logic in `func_3` ensures that the sum is calculated correctly by considering the conditions under which Alice's profit is maximized.

4. **Execution Summaries**:
   - `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_2` correctly reads and processes the input for each test case.
   - `func_3` correctly calculates the sum based on the given logic, ensuring that the conditions for Alice's profit are met.

Given the above analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. All functions work together to ensure that Alice's profit is maximized while considering Bob's strategy.

Correctness: **True**
