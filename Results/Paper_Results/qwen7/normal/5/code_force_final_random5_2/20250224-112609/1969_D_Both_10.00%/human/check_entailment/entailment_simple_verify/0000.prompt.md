You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_3` function does not handle the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob as required.

The function `func_3` calculates a sum based on the input arrays `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, but it does not consider the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. According to the problem description, Alice wants to maximize her profit, and Bob wants to minimize it. The function does not account for the fact that Bob can take up to `k` items for free if Alice buys fewer than `k` items, or `k` items for free if Alice buys more than or equal to `k` items.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Sort the items based on the difference `b_i - a_i`.
2. Determine the optimal number of items Alice should buy to maximize her profit.
3. Calculate the profit based on the optimal strategy.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import heapq

def max_profit(t, n, k, a, b):
    diff = [(b[i] - a[i], i) for i in range(n)]
    heapq.heapify(diff)
    
    # Calculate the total cost for Alice to buy all items
    total_cost = sum(a)
    
    # Calculate the maximum possible profit
    max_profit = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        if not diff:
            break
        _, idx = heapq.heappop(diff)
        max_profit += b[idx]
        total_cost -= a[idx]
    
    # Determine the optimal number of items Alice should buy
    if k <= n:
        min_cost = float('inf')
        for i in range(k, n + 1):
            current_cost = total_cost - sum(a[j] for j in range(i))
            if current_cost < min_cost:
                min_cost = current_cost
                optimal_items = i
    
    # Calculate Alice's profit
    if k <= n:
        return max_profit - min_cost
    else:
        return max_profit - total_cost

# Read input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    print(max_profit(t, n, k, a, b))
```

This corrected version handles the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob and calculates the correct profit based on the given inputs.
