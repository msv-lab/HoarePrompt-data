Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for val_a in sec_arr:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `val_a` and `sec_arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `sec_arr` has at least one element that hasn't been processed yet.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sub_summ` is `val_a[0]` + `val_a[0]` + `val_a[1]`.
   - `val_a` must be initialized.
   - `sec_arr` must have at least two elements.

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `val_a` is an element from `sec_arr`, and the loop processes each element of `sec_arr` sequentially, after processing one element, the next element will be taken from `sec_arr`.
   - Therefore, `sec_arr` must have at least one more element left to process for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `sub_summ` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `val_a` will change to the next element in `sec_arr`.
   - `sec_arr` must have at least one more element to ensure the loop can execute again.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `sub_summ` is `val_a[0]` + `val_a[0]` + `val_a[1]`, `val_a` must be initialized, `sec_arr` must have at least three elements**
