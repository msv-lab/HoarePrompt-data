Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses custom functions `func_1` and `func_2` for input handling.
   - `func_1` returns an integer value from the input.
   - `func_2` returns a tuple of integers from the input.
   - These functions seem to be placeholders for standard input handling, but they are not defined in the provided code snippet.

2. **Main Functionality:**
   - The program does not have a main function or any logic to solve the problem as described.
   - It only defines three functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`), but `func_3` does not implement the required logic to solve the problem.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - `func_3` takes two arguments: `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - It calculates a sum (`sub_summ`) using elements from `sec_arr` and `main_ar`.
   - The logic inside `func_3` does not match the problem requirements. Specifically:
     - It does not account for Alice's and Bob's optimal strategies.
     - It does not handle the scenario where Bob takes items for free or buys additional items from Alice.
     - It does not consider the constraints on the number of items Alice can buy and the value of `k`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem correctly. The provided functions do not implement the required functionality to determine Alice's profit based on the optimal strategies of both players.

### Correctness:
**False**

To solve the problem correctly, you need to implement logic that considers both Alice's and Bob's optimal strategies, including the conditions for Bob taking items for free and the differences in prices between Alice and Bob for each item.
