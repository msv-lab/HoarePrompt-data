Output State: **`sub_summ` is `val_a[0]` + `val_a[0]` + `val_a[1]`, `val_a` must be initialized, `sec_arr` must have at least two elements**

Explanation: The code `sub_summ += val_a[0]` adds the value of `val_a[0]` to `sub_summ`. Initially, `sub_summ` was equal to `0 + val_a[0] + val_a[1]`. After executing the code, `sub_summ` becomes `val_a[0] + val_a[0] + val_a[1]`. The conditions that `val_a` must be initialized and `sec_arr` must have at least two elements remain unchanged.
