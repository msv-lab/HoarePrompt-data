### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It correctly processes each test case by calling `putin()` to read the values of `n` and `k`, followed by reading the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads and returns a list of integers from the input.
   - It correctly processes the input string by splitting it and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function calculates the sum of specific elements from `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - However, the logic in `func_3` is flawed. It incorrectly sums the elements without considering the context of the problem. Specifically, it sums `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for all sublists in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic involves sorting the items based on `b_i` (Bob's price).
   - It uses a min-heap (`k_arr`) to keep track of the `k` most expensive items that Bob might take for free.
   - The logic to calculate Alice's profit is incorrect because it does not properly account for the optimal strategy of both Alice and Bob.

### Specific Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation in `func_3`**: The function `func_3` does not correctly calculate the sum required for the problem. It sums `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for all sublists in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is non-negative, which is not relevant to the problem's constraints.
- **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The main program does not implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It incorrectly handles the selection of items and the calculation of profit.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
