Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is \(i + 2\), `x \% 2 == 0` is a boolean indicating whether `x` is even, the loop runs up to `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `i` (which is \(i + 2\)) to the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `l` now contains both `ans` and the updated value of `i`.
