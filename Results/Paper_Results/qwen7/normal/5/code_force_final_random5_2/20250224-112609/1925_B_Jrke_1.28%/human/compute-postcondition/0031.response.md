Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is \(i + 2\), `x \% 2 == 0` is a boolean indicating whether `x` is even, the loop runs up to `int(x)`, and `l` is a list containing the elements `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` includes the element `x // i`.
