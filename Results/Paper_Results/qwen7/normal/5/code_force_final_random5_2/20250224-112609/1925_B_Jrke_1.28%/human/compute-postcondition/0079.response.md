Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `l` is `[max(l), i + 2]`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans = max(l)` updates `ans` to be the maximum value in list `l`. Given the initial state where `l` is `[ans, i + 2]`, the new value of `ans` will be the maximum between `ans` and `i + 2`. Since `ans` is already the first element in the list, if `i + 2` is less than or equal to `ans`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `i + 2`. However, regardless of the outcome, the list `l` is updated to include `max(l)`, which means if `i + 2` was larger, it replaces the old `ans` in the list, otherwise, `ans` stays the same in the list. Therefore, the updated state of `l` is `[max(l), i + 2]`.
