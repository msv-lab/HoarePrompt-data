Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `n`, respectively. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on `t`. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^3, while `x` and `n` are assigned the values of the input integers.
