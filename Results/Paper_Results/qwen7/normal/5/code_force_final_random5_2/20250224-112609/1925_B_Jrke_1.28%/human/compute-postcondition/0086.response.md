Output State: **`i` is incremented by 2, `l` is updated to `[ans, ans, i+1]`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Given the initial postconditions, `i` is incremented by 2, and `l` is updated to `[ans, ans, i]`. After executing the code, `i` is further incremented by 1 (since `x // i` is appended to the list), making it `i + 1`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged. Therefore, `l` becomes `[ans, ans, i + 1]`.
