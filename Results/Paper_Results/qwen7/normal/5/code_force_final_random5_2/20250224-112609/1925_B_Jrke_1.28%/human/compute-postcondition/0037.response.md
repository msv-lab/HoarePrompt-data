Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[ans, i + 2]`, `i` is `i + 2`, `x \% 2 == 0` is a boolean indicating whether `x` is even, the loop runs up to `int(x)`, and the list `l` is `[ans, i + 2]`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans` and `i + 2`.
