Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0), `x % 2 == 0` is a boolean indicating whether `x` is even, the loop runs up to int(`x` / 2), `l` is a list containing the value 1 and `i`, `l` is updated with `x // i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`.
