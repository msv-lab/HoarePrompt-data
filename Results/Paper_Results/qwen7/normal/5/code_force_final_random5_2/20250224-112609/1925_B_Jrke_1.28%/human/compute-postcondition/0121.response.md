Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1.
   - `n` is defined and non-zero.
   - `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[ans, ans]`, which simplifies to `ans`.
   - `i` is the next even or odd number depending on the current value of `x`.
   - `l` contains the value `ans` and the value of `x // i` appended to it.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)` up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` with a step of 2. This means `i` starts from 1 if `x` is even, and from 2 if `x` is odd.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - **`x`:** The value of `x` remains unchanged unless it is reduced to its smallest factor during the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `x` remains the same.
   - **`n`:** The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop.
   - **`ans`:** The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop.
   - **`i`:** The value of `i` will be incremented by 2 in each iteration until it exceeds `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - **`l`:** The list `l` will contain the value `ans` and the value of `x // i` appended to it in each iteration.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Since `i` starts from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)` and increments by 2, the next value of `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - Therefore, the condition for the next iteration is `i + 2 <= int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ans` remains the same.
   - `i` becomes `i + 2`.
   - `l` will contain the value `ans` and the value of `x // (i + 2)` appended to it.

**State:**
**`x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1; `n` is defined and non-zero; `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[ans, ans]`, which simplifies to `ans`; `i` is the next even or odd number depending on the current value of `x` plus 2, and `l` contains the value `ans` and the value of `x // (i + 2)` appended to it.**
