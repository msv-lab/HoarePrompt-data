Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {c: 'z'}, `i` is 1, and `c` is the first unique character in the sorted form of `b`.**

Explanation: 
- The code assigns the value of `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` to `char_map[c]`. Here, `i` is 0, so the expression simplifies to `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 0 - 1))` which is `chr(ord('a') + len(b) - 1)`. Since `c` is the first unique character in the sorted form of `b`, and assuming `b` is a non-empty string, the length of `b` is at least 1. Thus, the character assigned to `char_map[c]` is the last character of the alphabet, which is `'z'`.
- The value of `b` remains unchanged.
- The value of `char_map` is updated to include the key-value pair `{c: 'z'}`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `c` remains the same as it was before the execution of the code.
