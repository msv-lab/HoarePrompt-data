Output State: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` maps to the character 'a', `i` is 1, and `char_map[c]` is 'a'.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each unique character in the sorted form of `b`, assigning a new value to `char_map[c]` based on the formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. Since the loop runs for each unique character and `i` starts from 0, the last character in the sorted unique list will map to 'a' (since `len(b) - i - 1` would be 0 for the last character). As the loop progresses, each character will map to a letter starting from 'z' and decreasing until it reaches 'a'. Given that the loop processes each unique character exactly once, all unique characters in `b` will map to 'a' in the final state.
