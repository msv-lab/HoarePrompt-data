Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `c` and `b`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `b` contains at least one character.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `b` must contain at least one character.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is updated by adding the character corresponding to `c` from the `char_map`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `c` is being iterated over from `b`, at the end of the previous iteration, `b` still contains at least one character (since it was true before the loop started).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must still contain at least one character.
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1, so if it was 1 before, it will be 2 now.
   - The variable `s` will be updated by adding another character from `b` based on the current value of `c`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `b` must still contain at least one character.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 2.
   - `s` will be updated by adding another character from `b` based on the current value of `c`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `b` must contain at least one character, `i` is 2, `s` is updated by adding the character corresponding to `c` from the `char_map`.**
