You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of b is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). It is guaranteed that b is the result of encoding some string s according to the given algorithm.
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` maps to the character 'a', `i` is 1, and `char_map[c]` is 'a'.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each unique character in the sorted form of `b`, assigning a new value to `char_map[c]` based on the formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. Since the loop runs for each unique character and `i` starts from 0, the last character in the sorted unique list will map to 'a' (since `len(b) - i - 1` would be 0 for the last character). As the loop progresses, each character will map to a letter starting from 'z' and decreasing until it reaches 'a'. Given that the loop processes each unique character exactly once, all unique characters in `b` will map to 'a' in the final state.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: Output State: `b` must contain at least one character, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is a string composed of the characters corresponding to each character in `b` from the `char_map`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the string `b`, as it increments by 1 in each iteration. The variable `s` will be a concatenation of all the characters mapped to 'a' in `b` according to the `char_map`.
    return s
    #The program returns a string `s` which is composed of characters corresponding to each character 'a' in string `b` from the `char_map`, and the length of `b` is stored in `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `b`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The function returns a string `s` where each character in `b` is mapped to a corresponding character in `char_map`, and an integer `i` representing the length of `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string `s` which is composed of characters corresponding to each character 'a' in string `b` from the `char_map`, and the length of `b` is stored in `i`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
