Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {c: 'z'}, `i` is 1, and `char_map[c]` is 'y'**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 2 and `c` is the second character in the sorted set of `b`. After executing the code, `i` is decremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `char_map[c]` is updated to `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, which translates to `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 1 - 1))` or `chr(ord('a') + len(b) - 2)`. Since `c` is the second character in the sorted set of `b`, and given the transformation, `char_map[c]` becomes 'y'. The other variables remain unchanged.
