Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {c: 'z'}, `i` is 1, and `char_map[c]` is 'y'**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `c` is the second unique character in the sorted form of `b`. After assigning `char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, the value of `i` is decremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
- The calculation for the new value of `char_map[c]` is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 1 - 1))`, which simplifies to `chr(ord('a') + len(b) - 2)`. Given that `char_map[c]` was initially set to `'z'`, and considering the nature of the `chr` function and ASCII values, the new value for `char_map[c]` is `'y'`.
