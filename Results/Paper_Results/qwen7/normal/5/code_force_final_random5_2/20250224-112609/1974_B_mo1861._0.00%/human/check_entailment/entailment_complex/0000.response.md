Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires decoding a string `b` that is the result of encoding another string `s` using a specific algorithm. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - In `func_1`, the function aims to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`.
   - A dictionary `char_map` is used to store the mapping of each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - The first loop sorts the unique characters in `b` and populates `char_map` such that each character in `b` is mapped to a character in reverse order of the sorted unique characters.
   - The second loop iterates through each character in `b`, uses `char_map` to find the corresponding character, and appends it to the string `s`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for constructing `char_map` is correct. For each character in `b`, it finds its position in the sorted unique characters and maps it to the corresponding character in reverse order.
   - The decoding process correctly reverses the encoding process by mapping each character in `b` back to its original position in `r`, thus reconstructing the original string `s`.

Based on the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
