Output State: **`b` must contain at least one character, `i` is 3, `c` is the third character in `b`, `s` is the character corresponding to the third character in `b` from `char_map`.**

Explanation: The code `s += char_map[c]` adds to the string `s` the character from `char_map` that corresponds to the character `c` (which is the third character in `b`). The values of `b`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to include the character from `char_map` corresponding to `c`.
