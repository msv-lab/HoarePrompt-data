Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `c` which is iterated over the string `b`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `b` must contain at least one character.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is updated by adding the character corresponding to `c` from the `char_map`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `c` is being iterated over `b`, at the start of the next iteration, `c` will be the next character in `b`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 (since it starts at 1 and increments each iteration).
   - `s` will be updated by adding the character corresponding to the new `c` from the `char_map`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `b` must still contain at least one character because if it didn't, the loop would have terminated.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 2.
   - `s` will be updated based on the next character in `b`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`b` must contain at least one character, `i` is 2, `s` is updated by adding the character corresponding to the next character in `b` from the `char_map`**.
