Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`**.

This means that the first element of list `a` (`a[0]`) remains 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is calculated by adding the corresponding element from list `x` to the previous element in list `a`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
