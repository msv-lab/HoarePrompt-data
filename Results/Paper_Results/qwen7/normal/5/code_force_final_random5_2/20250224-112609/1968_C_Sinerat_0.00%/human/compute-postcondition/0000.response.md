Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution directly. It is used to iterate over the number of times the loop should run.
   - The expression `int(input())` is what determines how many times the loop will run. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is valid and within the specified range.

3. **Constraints on the Input**:
   - The problem states that `t` (the value returned by `int(input())`) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Given these points, we need to ensure that the state before the loop starts allows for the loop to execute correctly. Specifically, we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is within the required range.

**State Adjustment**:
- We need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
