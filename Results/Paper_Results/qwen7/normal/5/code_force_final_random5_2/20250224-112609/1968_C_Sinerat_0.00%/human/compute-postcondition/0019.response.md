Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop head.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is set to 1 in the loop head, we don't need to change its value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to start executing.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `x` is a list of integers entered by the user.
- `a` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `a[0]` is 500.

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute. Since `i` is already set to 1, we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
