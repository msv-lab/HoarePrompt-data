Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `i + 1` must be less than `n`, and `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` for the current `i`**.

This means that the value of `a[i]` has been updated according to the formula `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
