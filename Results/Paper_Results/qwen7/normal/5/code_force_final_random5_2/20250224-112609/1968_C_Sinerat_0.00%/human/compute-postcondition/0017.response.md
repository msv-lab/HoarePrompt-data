Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of all previous elements in the list `x` up to index `i-1` added to 500, `a` is now initialized as a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `a` with `n` zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and the initial condition of `a` (where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of all previous elements in the list `x` up to index `i-1` added to 500) remain unchanged. However, after executing the code, the list `a` is now filled with zeros.
