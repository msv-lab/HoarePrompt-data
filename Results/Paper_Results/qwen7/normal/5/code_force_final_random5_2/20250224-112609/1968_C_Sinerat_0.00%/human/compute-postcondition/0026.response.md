Output State: The loop will execute for all integers \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\). After all iterations, the list `a` will be transformed such that each element `a[i]` (for \(0 \leq i < n\)) will be the sum of 500 and the cumulative sum of the first \(i\) elements of the list `x`. In other words, `a[i]` will be equal to `500 + sum(x[:i+1])`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the final state of `a` will be a list where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the sum of 500 and all the previous elements in `x` up to that point.
