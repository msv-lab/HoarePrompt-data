Output State: The loop will execute all iterations if `n` is greater than `i` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`. After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`, and the list `a` will be updated such that each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`, starting from `a[0] = 500`.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `a[i]` will be the sum of `500` and the first `i+1` elements of `x`.
