Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` elements. The first element `a[0]` will be 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for \(0 \leq i < n\)) will be the sum of 500 and the cumulative sum of the first \(i+1\) elements of the list `x`. In other words, `a[i]` will be equal to `500 + sum(x[:i+1])`. The final element `a[n-1]` will be the sum of 500 and the cumulative sum of all elements in the list `x`.

To summarize, after all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will represent the cumulative sums of the list `x`, starting with 500, and each element `a[i]` will be the sum of 500 and the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `x`.
