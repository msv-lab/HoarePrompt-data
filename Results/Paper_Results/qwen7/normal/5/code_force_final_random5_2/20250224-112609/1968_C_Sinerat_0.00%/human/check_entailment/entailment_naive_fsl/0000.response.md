Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the program sets `a[0]` to a fixed value of 500 and then calculates subsequent values of `a` based on the previous value plus the corresponding `x` value. However, this approach does not guarantee that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1
```
The program will output:
```
500 501
```
But this does not satisfy the condition `2 = 501 \bmod 500`, since `501 \bmod 500 = 1`.

A correct solution would need to ensure that the modulo operation holds true for all `x_i` values. The provided program fails to do so in general.
