Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of all previous elements in the list `x` up to index `i-1` added to 500, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
