Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `res` must contain elements, `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ur` is `ur + 2`**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. Since `ul` was previously equal to `ur`, `ul` remains unchanged. All other variables (`i` and `res`) are not affected by this operation.
