Based on the initial state provided:

- `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, which means that the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is 2.
- `x` is an integer, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `a` is a list of integers, and `i` is an index within the range of `a`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Since `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it implies that `a[i] - 1` is the index in `r` where the value 2 is stored. However, this does not directly give us the value of `a[i]`. But we know that `a[i]` is an integer from the list `a`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[i] a[i]**
