Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**: 
   - The variable `i` starts from `2 * n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`. Therefore, initially, `i` should be set to `2 * n`.
   - The variable `n` is a constant that defines the range of the loop.

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial state of `i` to `2 * n` while keeping `n` as it is (since it is a constant defining the range).

**Adjusted States**:
- `i` should be `2 * n`.
- `n` remains as it is (no adjustment needed since it's a constant).

So, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `res` is an empty list, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `r[j]` being 2 during the loop's iterations for `i` in the range `[n, n-1]`**.
