Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues to execute as long as `res` contains elements and `ul` is not equal to `ur`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**: The loop iterates from `n` to `2 * n - 1`. Therefore, `i` should start from `n` and increment until it reaches `2 * n`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - The initial value of `i` should be `n`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`res` containing elements and `ul` not equal to `ur`) must be satisfied.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute:

- `i` should be set to `n`.
- `res` must contain elements.
- `ul` must not be equal to `ur`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `res` must contain elements, `ul` is not equal to `ur`**
