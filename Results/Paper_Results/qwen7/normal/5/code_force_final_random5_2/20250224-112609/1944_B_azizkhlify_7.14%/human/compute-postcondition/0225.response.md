Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`, and the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 4.**

Explanation: The variable `ur` is incremented by 2, making its new value `ur = 2 + 2 = 4`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
