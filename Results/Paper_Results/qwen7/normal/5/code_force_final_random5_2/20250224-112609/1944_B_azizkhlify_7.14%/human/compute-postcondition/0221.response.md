Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(n, 2 * n):` will execute as long as `i` is within the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - All elements in `res` have been printed.
   - `i` is the last element of `res`.
   - The values of `ul` and `ur` are not equal.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` is the last element of `res`, it means `i` is one less than the length of `res`. Let's denote the length of `res` as `len(res)`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be at least `n`. Therefore, `len(res)` must be at least `n`.
   - The value of `i` should be set to `n - 1` because it is the last element of `res` and the loop starts from `n`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The variable `i` needs to be adjusted to be `n - 1`.
   - The variable `n` must be such that the loop can start, meaning `n` must be less than or equal to `len(res)`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`**, and the values of `ul` and `ur` are not equal.
