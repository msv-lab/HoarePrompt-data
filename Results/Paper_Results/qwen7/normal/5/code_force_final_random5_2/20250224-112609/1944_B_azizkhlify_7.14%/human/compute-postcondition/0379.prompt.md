You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. Additionally, there is an array a of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        l = [0] * n
        
        r = [0] * n
        
        re = ul = ur = 0

        for i in range(n):
            l[a[i] - 1] += 1
        
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):

            if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')

                break
        
        k = 2 * k - ul
        
        if k:
            for i in range(n):
                if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                    print(a[i], end=' ')
                    re += 1
                    res.append(a[i])
                if re == k:
                    break
        
        print()
        
        for i in res:
            print(i, end=' ')
        
        if ul != ur:
            for i in range(n, 2 * n):
                if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                    print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                    ur += 2
                if ul == ur:
                    break
        
        print()
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows:
    #
    #- `i` is `2 * n`.
    #- `res` is an empty list.
    #- Both `ul` and `ur` are equal to the total number of pairs (2 * k) found in the array `a` where an element appears exactly twice.
    #- All elements that satisfy the conditions specified in the loop body have been printed.
    #
    #This means that after processing all elements in the array `a`, the loop has identified and printed all pairs of identical elements up to `k` pairs, and any remaining elements that were part of pairs but not fully printed due to the stopping conditions have also been accounted for.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs (t, n, k, and an array a) where t is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, n and k are integers with specific ranges, and a is an array of length 2n with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice. The function returns information based on these inputs.
