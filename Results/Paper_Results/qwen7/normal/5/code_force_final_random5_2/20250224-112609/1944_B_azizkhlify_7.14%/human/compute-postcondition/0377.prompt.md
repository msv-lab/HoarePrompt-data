Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. Additionally, there is an array a of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `re` is `k + 1`, `i` is `2 * n`, `res` contains the elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and `ur` is increased by `2 * n` for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2. The loop stops when `ul` equals `ur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All elements in `res` have been printed, `i` is `2 * n`, `n` is less than or equal to the length of `res`, and `ul` is equal to `ur` plus twice the number of times the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `2 * n`, `res` is empty, and both `ul` and `ur` are equal.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
