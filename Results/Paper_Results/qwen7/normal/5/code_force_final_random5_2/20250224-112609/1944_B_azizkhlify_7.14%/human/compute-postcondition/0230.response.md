Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`, `ul` is equal to `ur`, and the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables. It only indicates that the loop or conditional block is exited. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `ul`, `ur`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged according to the initial postcondition.
