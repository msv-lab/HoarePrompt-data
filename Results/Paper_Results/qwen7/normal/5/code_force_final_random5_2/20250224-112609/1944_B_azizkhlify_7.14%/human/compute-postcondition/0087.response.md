Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `re` is exactly `k`.
   - `i` is `2 * n` minus the number of iterations the loop executed.
   - `res` contains the elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 until `re` reaches `k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `re` is exactly `k`.
- `i` is calculated as `2 * n` minus the number of iterations the loop executed. Since the number of iterations is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` without additional context. However, we know it is derived from `2 * n` and the number of iterations.
- `res` is a list that contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 until `re` reaches `k`. This means `res` will contain elements from `a` up to the point where `re` equals `k`.

Given the print statement `print(i, end=' ')`, it will print the value of `i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided and depends on the loop iterations, we can only describe it in terms of the given formula.

Output: **2 * n - number of loop iterations**
