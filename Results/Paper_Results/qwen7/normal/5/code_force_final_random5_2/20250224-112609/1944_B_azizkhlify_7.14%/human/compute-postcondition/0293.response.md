Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and `ul`.

2. **Understand the changes from the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value (`i_new`).
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ul` remains the same.

3. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since `i` was increased by 1, the new value of `i` is `i_new + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged, so it is still `n`.
   - `ul` remains unchanged, so it is still `ul`.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The new value of `i` is `i_new + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ul` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `i_new + 1`, `n` remains the same, and `ul` remains the same**.
