Output State: **`res` is now ['a[i]'], `re` is 1, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. Since `res` was initially an empty list, after appending `a[i]`, `res` becomes a list containing `a[i]`. The values of `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `i`, `n`, and the condition of `l[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged.
