Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`, `ul` is equal to `ur` + 2, and the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `res`, `ul`, `a`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `ul` is now equal to the original value of `ur` plus 2.
