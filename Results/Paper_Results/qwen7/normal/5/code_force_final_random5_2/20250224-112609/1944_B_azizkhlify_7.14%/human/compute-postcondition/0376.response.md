Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `2 * n`, `res` is empty, and both `ul` and `ur` are equal.

Explanation: Given the conditions and behavior of the loop, it processes the input data by counting occurrences of each element in the array `a` and determining which elements should be printed based on the values of `k`, `l`, and `r`. After processing all test cases, the loop ensures that all necessary elements are printed, and the variables `res`, `ul`, and `ur` are reset to their final states. Since the loop processes each test case independently and the conditions ensure that all elements are accounted for, `res` will be empty, and `ul` and `ur` will be equal, reflecting the total count of pairs found in the array `a`.
