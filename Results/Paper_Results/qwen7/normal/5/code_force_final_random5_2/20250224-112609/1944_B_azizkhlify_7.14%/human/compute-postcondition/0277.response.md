Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is at least 1.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

To break it down:

1. Since `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, this implies that the value of `a[i] - 1` must correspond to an index in the list `l` where the value is 2. However, the actual value of `a[i]` itself is not explicitly given, only that `a[i] - 1` maps to a position in `l` with the value 2.

2. The `print` statement outputs `a[i]` twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Given the information, we can't determine the exact value of `a[i]` from the provided conditions alone. Therefore, the output will include the value of `a[i]` repeated twice, followed by a space.

Output: **[a[i]] [a[i]]**
