Postcondition: `re` is 0, `ul` is either 4 or 4 * `k`, `ur` is 0, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `res` is an empty list, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `a[i]` being 2 during the loop's iterations for `i` in the range `[n, n-1]`.

This postcondition summarizes that if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ul` becomes 4 or 4 * `k` (depending on the initial value), otherwise `ul` remains as either 2 or 2 * `k`. The other variables (`re`, `ur`, `i`, `a`, `res`, and `l`) retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
