Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` values from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value within this range.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

Given the above points, let's adjust the state:

- The variable `i` needs to be updated to its new value, which is the previous value of `i` plus 1.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not being modified within the loop.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent it as `i_prev + 1`, where `i_prev` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`**
