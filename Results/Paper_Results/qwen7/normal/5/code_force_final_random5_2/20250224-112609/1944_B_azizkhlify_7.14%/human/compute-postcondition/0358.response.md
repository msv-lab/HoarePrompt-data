Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`: This means `i` is set to `n + 1`.
   - `res` must contain elements: This indicates that `res` is a list or any other collection with at least one element, but it does not affect the print statement directly.
   - `ul` is equal to `ur`: This means `ul` and `ur` have the same value, but their specific values do not impact the print statement.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement: This suggests that there is a loop or if statement being executed, but it is broken out of before reaching the print statement. However, this does not change the values of `i` or `a`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```
   - `a[i]`: Since `i` is `n + 1`, we need to know the value of `a[n + 1]`. The value of `a[n + 1]` is not explicitly provided, so we will denote it as `a[n + 1]`.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output the value of `a[n + 1]` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[n + 1] a[n + 1]**
