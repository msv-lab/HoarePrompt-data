Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the second element of `res`.
- `res` is a list containing elements that can be printed.
- `l` and `a` are such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 1 or unchanged for the elements that were printed.
- `re` is less than `k`.

We need to determine what will be printed when the following statement executes:

```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Value of `i`:** 
   - `i` is explicitly stated to be the second element of `res`. Therefore, `i = res[1]`.

2. **Value of `res`:**
   - `res` is a list containing elements that can be printed. Since no specific values are provided for `res`, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` without knowing the contents of `res`.

3. **Other Variables (`l`, `a`, `re`, `k`):**
   - These variables do not directly affect the value of `i` being printed. They are mentioned to provide context but do not influence the immediate output of the `print(i, end=' ')` statement.

Given the above, the only value that needs to be printed is `i`, which is the second element of the list `res`.

Output: **res[1]**
