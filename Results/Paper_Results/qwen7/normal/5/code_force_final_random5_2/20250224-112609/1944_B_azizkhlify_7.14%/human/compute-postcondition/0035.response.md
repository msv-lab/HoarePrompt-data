Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is an empty list.
- `re` is 0.
- `ul` is 2 * `k`.
- `ur` is 0.
- `i` is `n + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the list `a` or the value of `n`. Since `i` is defined as `n + 1`, and without knowing the value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]`.

Therefore, the output will be a formatted string indicating the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **a[n+1] a[n+1]**
