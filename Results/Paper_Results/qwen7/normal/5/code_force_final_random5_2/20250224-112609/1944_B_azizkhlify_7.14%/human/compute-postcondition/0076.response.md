Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `re` is 1, `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0, `res` contains the value of `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The line `res.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the next access to `a[i]` would be with the new value of `i`. The values of `re` and `n` remain unchanged.
