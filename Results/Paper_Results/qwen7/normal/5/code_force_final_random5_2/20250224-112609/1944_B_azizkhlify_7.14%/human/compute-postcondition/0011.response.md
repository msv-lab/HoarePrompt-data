Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `re` is 0.
   - `ul` is 0.
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `l[a[2] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition `for i in range(n)` means the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 4.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final State**:
   - `res` remains an empty list.
   - `re` remains 0.
   - `ul` remains 0.
   - `ur` remains 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` becomes 4.
   - `l[a[2] - 1]` is not directly affected by the loop but its value might change inside the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 4, `l[a[2] - 1]` is incremented by 1**.
