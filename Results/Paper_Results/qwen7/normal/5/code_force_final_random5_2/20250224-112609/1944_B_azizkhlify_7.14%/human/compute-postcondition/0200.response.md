Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is mentioned but does not affect the value of `a[i]` since it is not used in the print statement.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

Since `i` is 3, the statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will attempt to print the element at index 3 of the list `a`.

However, the value of `a` itself is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the element being accessed without specifying its value.

Output: **a[3]**
