Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, `n` remains the same, `ul` either becomes `k * 2` if the condition was met or retains its previous value, and the lists `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `ur`, and `res` retain their final states as they were last updated within the loop. The value of `k` is non-zero since it entered the if condition.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` remains the same, `re` is equal to `k` if the element at index `a[0] - 1` in list `l` is equal to 1 and `res` contains the element `a[0]`, otherwise `re` is not equal to `k` and `res` does not contain any specific value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` remains the same, `re` is equal to `k` if the element at index `a[0] - 1` in list `l` is equal to 1 and `res` contains the element `a[0]`, otherwise `re` is not equal to `k` and `res` does not contain any specific value, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` remains the same. If `re` equals `k`, then `re` remains unchanged and `res` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `re` is 1 and `res` is a list with the element `a[4]` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
