Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `i` (which is `n`), `i` is `n`, `l[a[n-1] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` is equal to `n`. The variable `l` has been modified according to the values in the array `a`, where each index `a[i] - 1` in `l` has been incremented by 1 for every iteration of the loop. All other variables (`res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    r[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `i` is `n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
