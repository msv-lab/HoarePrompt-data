Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` remains the same (no specific value given, but it is unchanged).
   - `re` is equal to `k` if the element at index `a[0] - 1` in list `l` is equal to 1 and `res` contains the element `a[0]`, otherwise `re` is not equal to `k` and `res` does not contain any specific value.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For `re` and `res`, since the condition for their values depends on the element at index `a[0] - 1` in list `l`, these values do not change based on the loop iteration itself. They depend on the initial conditions and the list `l`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` remains the same, `re` is equal to `k` if the element at index `a[0] - 1` in list `l` is equal to 1 and `res` contains the element `a[0]`, otherwise `re` is not equal to `k` and `res` does not contain any specific value.**
