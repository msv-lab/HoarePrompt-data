### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its behavior step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
- For each outcome \( i \), the multiplier \( k_i \) determines the amount received if that outcome wins.
- The goal is to find a distribution of coins \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i \) for every \( i \).

#### Given Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the absolute value of the product of \( a \) and \( b \) divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - It is used to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, but only for the first two numbers in the sequence.

2. **Function `func_2(numbers)`**:
   - This function computes the LCM of the entire list of multipliers using `func_1`.
   - It iteratively applies `func_1` to the current result and the next element in the list, effectively computing the LCM of all elements in the list.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
   - It then computes the LCM of all multipliers using `func_2`.
   - The program then distributes the coins equally among the outcomes, setting each \( x_i \) to \( \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \).
   - If the sum of these distributions is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the distribution.

#### Key Points to Evaluate:
1. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM calculation is correct and is used to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is minimized.
2. **Distribution Logic**: The logic of distributing the coins as \( \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \) is sound because it ensures that the total amount of coins bet is less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where the sum of the distributions is greater than or equal to the LCM by printing `-1`.

#### Test Case Analysis:
Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  3 2 7
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  27 41 12
  ```

- Actual Execution:
  - LCM of `[3, 2, 7]` is \( 42 \).
  - Distribution: \( \frac{42}{3} = 14 \), \( \frac{42}{2} = 21 \), \( \frac{42}{7} = 6 \).
  - Total coins bet: \( 14 + 21 + 6 = 41 \), which is less than \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \), \( 2 \times 21 = 42 \), and \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \).

This matches the expected output.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. The original assessment was incorrect because the program does indeed solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
