Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for` statement `for num in numbers[1:]`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, and `num` is the second element of `numbers`.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
   - `numbers` must still have at least 2 elements (since the loop starts from the second element).
   - `num` must be the third element of `numbers` (since the loop increments by 1 each iteration).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Based on the above conditions, we need to update the state as follows:
   - `numbers` must have at least 3 elements (to ensure there is a third element for the next iteration).
   - `num` must be the third element of `numbers`.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, and `num` is the third element of `numbers`**.
