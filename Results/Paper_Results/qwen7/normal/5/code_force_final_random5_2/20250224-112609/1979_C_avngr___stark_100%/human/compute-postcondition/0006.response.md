Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, and `num` is the fourth element of `numbers`.**

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(result, num)` updates the value of `result` by calling the function `func_1` with `result` and `num` as arguments. Since `num` is the fourth element of `numbers`, its value remains unchanged. The precondition that `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements also remains valid. The value of `result` is now the return value of `func_1(result, num)`, but the specific value of `result` cannot be determined without knowing the implementation of `func_1`.
