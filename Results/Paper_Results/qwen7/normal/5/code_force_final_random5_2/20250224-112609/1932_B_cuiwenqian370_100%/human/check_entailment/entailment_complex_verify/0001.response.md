### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the main steps and logic of the program. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure everything aligns with the problem statement and the annotated code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the split data to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`a`).
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining periodicities, calculating the next year when the next sign will occur. This calculation is done correctly by ensuring the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

3. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The line `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` simplifies to:
     ```python
     next_year = ((last_year + a[i] - 1) // a[i]) * a[i]
     ```
   - This logic is correct because it finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

4. **Storing Results:**
   - The final year for each test case is stored in the `results` list as a string.

5. **Output:**
   - The program writes the results to stdout, joining them with newlines.

The annotated code and the original assessment correctly describe the program's behavior. The logic used to calculate the next year for each sign is sound and matches the problem requirements. The program handles multiple test cases and processes each one correctly.
