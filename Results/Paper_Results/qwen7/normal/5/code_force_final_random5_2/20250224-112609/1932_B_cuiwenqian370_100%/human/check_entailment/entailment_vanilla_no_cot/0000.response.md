Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the year when all signs will occur sequentially. The logic in `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the way it calculates the next year for each sign is incorrect. Here's why:

- The program attempts to find the next occurrence of each sign starting from the previous sign's year, but it doesn't correctly handle the sequential nature of the occurrences.
- The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` is an attempt to find the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year`, but it doesn't ensure that the sequence of years is strictly increasing as required.

To fix this, we need to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods to find the correct year when all signs will occur together. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        # Calculate LCM of all periods
        result = reduce(lcm, a)
        results.append(str(result))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This version correctly calculates the year when all signs will occur together by finding the least common multiple of all the periods.
