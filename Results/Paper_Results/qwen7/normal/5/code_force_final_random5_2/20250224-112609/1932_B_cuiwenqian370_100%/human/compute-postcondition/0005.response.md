Output State: **`index` is 2, `T` is an integer from the list `data`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the values of `index`, `T`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
