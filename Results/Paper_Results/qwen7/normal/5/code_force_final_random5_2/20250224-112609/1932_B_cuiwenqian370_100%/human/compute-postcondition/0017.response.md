Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])**.

Explanation: The line `last_year = next_year` does not change the value of `last_year`; instead, it updates `last_year` to be equal to the current value of `next_year`. Since `next_year` is defined as `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])`, updating `last_year` to `next_year` maintains the equality between `last_year` and `next_year`. All other variables remain unchanged.
