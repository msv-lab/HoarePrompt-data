Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `index` is increased by `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers.**

Explanation: The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `index` is now `index + n`.
