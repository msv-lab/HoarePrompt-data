Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, resulting in `i` being equal to `n`, `last_year` being equal to 4, `next_year` also being 4, and `a[1]` remaining unchanged.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the final value of `last_year` is 4, and it will be the last element in the `results` list, which initially contained a single string "a[0]". Since `last_year` is now 4, the `results` list will contain a single string "4".
