Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_year` is the result of applying the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` starting with the initial value of `last_year`, `results` is a list containing a single string element which is the final value of `last_year` converted to a string.**

This means that after executing the loop and the line `results.append(str(last_year))`, the variable `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `last_year` has been updated through the specified formula `n-1` times, and `results` is a list containing one element, which is the final value of `last_year` as a string.
