Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - From the given state before the loop, we know that `i` is initially equal to `n`.
   - The loop starts with `i` being 1 (since `range(1, n)` means `i` takes values from 1 to `n-1`).

3. **Adjust the state of `i` and `n`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being 1, we need to adjust `i` to be 1.
   - The value of `n` should be such that the loop can execute, meaning `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Other variables**:
   - `index`, `last_year`, `results`, `T`, and `a` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
