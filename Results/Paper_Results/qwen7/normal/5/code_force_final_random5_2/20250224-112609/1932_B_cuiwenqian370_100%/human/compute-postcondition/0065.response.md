Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( T \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of the list), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). For each test case, it calculates the final value of `last_year` by iteratively applying the formula \((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]\) for each element in the list \( a \). The function then stores the final value of `last_year` as a string in a list `results` for each test case and outputs these values separated by newlines.**
