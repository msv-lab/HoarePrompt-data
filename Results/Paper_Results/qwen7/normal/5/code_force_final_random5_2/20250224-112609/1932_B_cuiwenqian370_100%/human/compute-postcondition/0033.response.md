Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `last_year` is equal to `next_year`
   - `a[1]` remains unchanged

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must be true. Given that `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 2.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` needs to be 2 for the next iteration, and the other variables (`last_year`, `next_year`, and `a[1]`) are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `a[1]` remains unchanged**
