You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is the final value obtained by successively updating `last_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and `results` contains a string representation of `next_year` repeated `T` times.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `last_year` will be the same as `next_year` and will be the result of applying the given formula for each element in the list `a` for all iterations specified by `T`. The `results` list will contain this final value of `last_year` converted to a string and repeated `T` times, as the loop appends the final `last_year` value to the `results` list in each iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the split data to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`a`).
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining periodicities, calculating the next year when the next sign will occur. This calculation is done correctly by ensuring the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

3. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The line `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`. This is equivalent to:
     ```python
     next_year = ((last_year + a[i] - 1) // a[i]) * a[i]
     ```
   - This logic is correct because it finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

4. **Storing Results:**
   - The final year for each test case is stored in the `results` list as a string.

5. **Output:**
   - The program writes the results to stdout, joining them with newlines.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The calculations and logic are sound and match the problem requirements.
