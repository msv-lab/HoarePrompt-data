Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is 4, `next_year` is 4, `a[1]` remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the string "4"**.

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `last_year` (which is 4) to the `results` list. Since `last_year` was already set to 4, appending its string representation does not change the contents of the list. All other variables (`i`, `last_year`, `next_year`, and `a[1]`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
