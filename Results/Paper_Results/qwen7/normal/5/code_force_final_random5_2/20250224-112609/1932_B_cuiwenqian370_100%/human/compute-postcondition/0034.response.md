Output State: **`i` is 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `a[1]` remains unchanged, `next_year` is 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_year` based on the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, and `a[1]` remains unchanged, we substitute the values into the formula:

- `i` is 2, so `a[i]` is `a[2]`.
- Since `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, let's denote `last_year` as `L`.

The formula simplifies to:
\[ \text{next\_year} = (L + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2] \]
\[ \text{next\_year} = (L + a[2]) // a[2] * a[2] \]

Since `L` is equal to `next_year`, and assuming `a[2]` is a positive integer, the expression simplifies further. For simplicity, let's assume `a[2]` is 1 (since no specific value was given, we use the simplest case):
\[ \text{next\_year} = (L + 1) // 1 * 1 \]
\[ \text{next\_year} = L + 1 \]

Given that `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, and initially `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, we can conclude that `next_year` becomes 3 if `last_year` was 2. However, since the exact value of `last_year` is not specified, we keep it as `L` and note that `next_year` is calculated based on the formula.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `i` is 2,
- `last_year` is equal to `next_year`,
- `a[1]` remains unchanged,
- `next_year` is 3.
