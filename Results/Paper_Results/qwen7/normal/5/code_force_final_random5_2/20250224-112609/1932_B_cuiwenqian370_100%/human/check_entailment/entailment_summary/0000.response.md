Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which all \( n \) signs will occur according to the Chaya tribe's belief. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over the test cases, correctly parsing the number of signs \( n \) and the periodicities \( a \) for each test case.

2. **Calculation Logic**: For each test case, the program initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity \( a[0] \). It then iteratively updates `last_year` using the formula \((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]\) for each subsequent periodicity \( a[i] \). This formula ensures that `last_year` is adjusted to the next multiple of \( a[i] \) that comes strictly after the previous `last_year`.

3. **Result Storage and Output**: After processing each test case, the final value of `last_year` is appended to the `results` list as a string. Finally, the program outputs the results for all test cases, separated by newlines.

Given the logical correctness of the implementation and the adherence to the problem description, the program should produce the correct output for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
