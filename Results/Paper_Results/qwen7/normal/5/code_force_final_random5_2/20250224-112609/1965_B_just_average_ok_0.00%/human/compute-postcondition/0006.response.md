Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.
2. **Current state**: 
   - `idx` is 1.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).

3. **Determine the loop head variables**: The variables in the loop head are `k` and `idx`.

4. **Check the loop condition at the current state**:
   - `idx` is 1.
   - `1 << idx` means \(1 << 1 = 2\).
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `k >= 2`.

5. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `k >= 2` must still hold true.
   - Since `idx` is incremented inside the loop (though not shown explicitly in the given code snippet), we need to ensure that `k` remains greater than or equal to 2 after the increment.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to ensure that `k` is still greater than or equal to 2 after the loop increments `idx`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, and `nums` do not affect the loop condition directly and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: `idx` is 2, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2**
