Output State: **`idx` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 4, `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)**.

Explanation: The line `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Since `idx` was initially 2, after executing this line, `idx` becomes 3. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
