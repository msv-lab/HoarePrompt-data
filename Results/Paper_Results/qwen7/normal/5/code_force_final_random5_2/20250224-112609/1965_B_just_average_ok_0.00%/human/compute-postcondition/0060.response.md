Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes three values: t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), n (a positive integer between 2 and 10^6), and k (a positive integer between 1 and n). The function returns different outputs based on the values of n and k within each test case. Specifically, if the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7, it processes each test case and returns appropriate results for each.**

This means the function indirectly accepts multiple sets of parameters through its processing logic, where each set consists of t, n, and k, and returns outputs based on the conditions specified for n and k.
