You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        
        idx -= 1
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute for each test case provided by the user. For each test case, `idx` will be set to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. After processing all test cases, `nums` will contain the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) (i.e., the powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\)), along with any additional elements added during the loop execution based on the value of `k` for each test case. Each `nums` list will have its specific `1 << idx` value removed. The final state of `nums` after all iterations will be a combination of these lists, with each list potentially having different additional elements based on the `k` values for each test case. The length of `nums` for each test case will vary depending on the value of `k`, but the overall structure of `nums` will consist of the powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) and any additional elements specified by the loop.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `k` for each test case are not specified, we cannot determine the exact contents of `nums` after all iterations. However, we know that `nums` will always include the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), and may include additional elements based on the `k` values for each test case. The length of `nums` for each test case will be determined by the value of `k` and the operations performed within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes three values: t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), n (a positive integer between 2 and 10^6), and k (a positive integer between 1 and n). The function returns different outputs based on the values of n and k within each test case. Specifically, if the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7, it processes each test case and returns appropriate results for each.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
