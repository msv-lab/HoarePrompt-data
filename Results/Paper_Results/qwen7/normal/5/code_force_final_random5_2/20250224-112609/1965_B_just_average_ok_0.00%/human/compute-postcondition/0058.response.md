Output State: The loop will execute for each test case provided by the input. For each test case, `idx` will be set to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. The list `nums` will initially contain integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). After determining `idx`, the list `nums` will be modified to include `k - 2^idx`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^idx + 1`, and exclude `2^idx`. The final state of `nums` will depend on the value of `k` for each test case. After all test cases have been processed, the length of `nums` and its contents will reflect the unique elements added or removed during each iteration based on the value of `k` for each test case.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` for each test case are not specified, the final `nums` list will be a combination of the initial powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) and the additional elements added based on the specific `k` values for each test case, with the appropriate elements removed. The length of `nums` will be 25 minus the number of elements removed, which is always 1 in each iteration, resulting in a maximum possible length of 24 for `nums`.

The output state after all iterations will be the length of `nums` and the list `nums` itself, reflecting the unique elements determined by the input values of `k` for each test case.
