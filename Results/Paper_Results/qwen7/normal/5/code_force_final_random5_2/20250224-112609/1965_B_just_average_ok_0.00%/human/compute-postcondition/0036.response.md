Output State: **`idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is `current_iterations + 1`, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) excluding \(2^{24}\) and now also contains `k - nums[idx]` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element \(2^{idx}\) from the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 24, the element removed is \(2^{24}\). The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. The list `nums` originally contained integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) and an additional element `k - nums[idx]` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. After removing \(2^{24}\), the list no longer contains this element.
