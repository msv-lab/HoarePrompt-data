You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1

        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute for each test case provided by the user. For each test case, `idx` will be set to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. After processing all test cases, `nums` will contain the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) (i.e., the powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\)), along with any additional elements added during the loop execution based on the value of `k` for each test case. Each `nums` list will have its specific `1 << idx` value removed. The final state of `nums` after all iterations will be a combination of these lists, with each list potentially having different additional elements based on the `k` values for each test case. The length of `nums` for each test case will vary depending on the value of `k`, but the overall structure of `nums` will consist of the powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) and any additional elements specified by the loop.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `k` for each test case are not specified, we cannot determine the exact contents of `nums` after all iterations. However, we know that `nums` will always include the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), and may include additional elements based on the `k` values for each test case. The length of `nums` for each test case will be determined by the value of `k` and the operations performed within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\). This is done using the list comprehension `[1 << i for i in range(24)]`.
   - This ensures that the list contains the values \(1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots, 2^{23}\).

3. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `k`:**
   - The variable `idx` is used to find the index of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - This is done using the loop `while k >= 1 << idx: idx += 1`, followed by `idx -= 1`.

4. **Modifying the List:**
   - The program appends three new values to the list `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This value ensures that there is no subsequence summing to `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This value ensures that there is a subsequence summing to `k + 1`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This value ensures that there is a subsequence summing to `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - It then removes the element `1 << idx` from the list.

5. **Output:**
   - The length of the modified list `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of the list `nums` are printed.

### Verification Against Problem Constraints and Requirements:

1. **Size Constraint:**
   - The list `nums` is constructed with at most 25 elements (since it starts with 24 elements and modifies it to 25).

2. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - By appending `k - nums[idx]` and removing `1 << idx`, the list is designed such that no subsequence sums to `k`.

3. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`:**
   - The list includes all powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\), ensuring that any value from 1 to \(2^{24} - 1\) can be formed by summing these values.
   - By appending `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the list ensures that all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a sequence `a` that meets all the required conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.
