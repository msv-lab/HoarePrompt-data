Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)**.

Explanation: The variable `idx` was originally set to 24. The code `idx -= 1` decrements `idx` by 1, resulting in `idx` being 23. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
