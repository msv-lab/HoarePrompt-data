Output State: `idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k >= 1 << idx`. Given that `1 << idx` doubles with each iteration starting from \(1 << 0 = 1\), the loop will continue until `idx` reaches 24 because \(1 << 24 = 16777216\). After 24 iterations, `idx` will be 24, and `k` must be at least \(16777216\) for the loop to have completed all its iterations.
