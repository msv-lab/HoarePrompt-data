Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)**.

Explanation: The line `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` is 0, so after executing this line, `idx` becomes 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
