Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence sums to `k`.
   - All integers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) must be representable as a subsequence sum.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).
   - It then finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and adjusts `nums` accordingly by removing this power of 2 and adding some specific values related to `k`.

3. **Key Steps**:
   - For each test case, it calculates `idx` as the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - It then removes \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from `nums` and adds \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\) to `nums`.
   - This ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` (since \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed) and allows forming all sums from 1 to `n` excluding `k`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The constructed sequence `nums` will always include the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), ensuring that all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.
   - The removal of \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and addition of specific values guarantees that no subsequence sums to `k`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the code correctly constructs the required sequence for each test case, adhering to the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
