Output State: `idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 << idx\). Given that \(1 << 23 = 8388608\) and the condition `k` must be at least 4 after 3 iterations, it implies that `k` must be sufficiently large to allow 24 iterations (since \(1 << 24 = 16777216\)). After 24 iterations, `idx` will be 24, and the loop will terminate because \(k\) will no longer satisfy the condition \(k \geq 1 << 24\).
