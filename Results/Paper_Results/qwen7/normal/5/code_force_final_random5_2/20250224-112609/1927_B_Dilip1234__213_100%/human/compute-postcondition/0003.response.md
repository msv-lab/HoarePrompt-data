State: **`i` is 0, `j` must be 0, `n` must be at least 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `j` and the range function's parameter `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range defined by `range(26)`, which means `j` should start from 0 and `n` (which is 26) must be at least 1.
3. Since `i` is not used in the loop head, its value does not need to be adjusted.
4. The initial value of `j` is not specified in the given state, so it needs to be set to 0 to start the loop.
5. The value of `n` must be at least 1 to allow the loop to start, but since the range is defined as `range(26)`, `n` is already set to 26, which satisfies this condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` to be 0 and `n` to be at least 1 (though `n` is already satisfied by the range definition).
