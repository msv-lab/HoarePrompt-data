You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
    return s



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. Each element `a_i` in `a` represents the number of previous indices with the same character in the string. The function constructs a string `s` based on these conditions and returns it. After execution, the function returns the string 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes `n` and `a` as inputs.
   - It initializes an empty string `s` and a list `char_count` of size 26 (to keep track of how many times each character has been used).

3. **Building the String:**
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - It iterates through each character `j` from 0 to 25 (representing 'a' to 'z').
     - If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, it means we need to use the character corresponding to `j` at position `i` in the string `s`.
     - It appends the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` to `s` and increments `char_count[j]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function returns the constructed string `s`.

### Verification:

1. **Trace Construction:**
   - The trace array `a` indicates the number of previous occurrences of the current character.
   - For example, in the trace `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4]`, the fourth character ('a') is the first occurrence of 'a', the sixth character ('d') is the second occurrence of 'a', and so on.

2. **Character Assignment:**
   - The program ensures that each character is assigned based on the trace value.
   - It uses a simple loop to find the appropriate character to place at each position.

3. **Guaranteed Validity:**
   - The problem guarantees that for each test case, there exists a suitable string `s` that matches the given trace.
   - The program correctly handles this by ensuring that characters are placed according to the trace values.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly constructs a string `s` that matches the given trace array `a`. Each character is placed at the correct position based on the number of previous occurrences indicated by the trace.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
