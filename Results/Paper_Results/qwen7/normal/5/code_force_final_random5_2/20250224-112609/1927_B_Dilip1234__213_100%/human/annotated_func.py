#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the string, and a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where each element a_i (0 <= a_i < n) represents the number of previous indices with the same character in the string.
def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 26, `j` is 25, `n` must be greater than 26, `s` is the string 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy' repeated 3 times, which is 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy', and `char_count` is a list where `char_count[3]` is 3, `char_count[4]` to `char_count[25]` are each 3, and all other elements are 0.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` reaches 26, `j` reaches 25, `n` must be greater than 26, `s` contains the string 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy' repeated 3 times (making it 96 characters long), and `char_count` indicates that the characters corresponding to indices 3 ('d') to 25 ('z') have each appeared 3 times in the string `s`.
    return s
    #The program returns the string 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. Each element `a_i` in `a` represents the number of previous indices with the same character in the string. The function constructs a string `s` based on these conditions and returns it. After execution, the function returns the string 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy'.
