Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x != 1`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `x` is an input integer.
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must not be equal to 1 (`x != 1`).

Given the current state:
- `t` is 0 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
- `i` is 3 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
- `x` is an input integer (we need to ensure this integer is not 1).
- `max` is 100000000 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
- `min` is -100000000 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
- `ans` is an empty list (this is not relevant to the loop condition).

To satisfy the loop condition `x != 1`, `x` must be any integer except 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `x` must not be equal to 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list**
