Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer equal to `t`, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged, and `ans` is set to an empty list.
