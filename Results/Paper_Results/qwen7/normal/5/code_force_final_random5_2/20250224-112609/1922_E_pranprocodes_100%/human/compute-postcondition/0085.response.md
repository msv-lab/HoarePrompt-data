Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is 1, `max` is -100000000, `min` is 100000000, `ans` is a list containing integers from 100000000 to -100000000 (inclusive) in reverse order, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.**

Explanation: The `ans.reverse()` method reverses the list `ans` in place. Initially, `ans` contains integers from -100000000 to 100000000 in ascending order. After reversing, `ans` will contain these integers in descending order from 100000000 to -100000000. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial or final states before the reverse operation.
