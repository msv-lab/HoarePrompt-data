Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing 99999999, `t` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max` (which is 99999999) to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` now contains the value 99999999.
