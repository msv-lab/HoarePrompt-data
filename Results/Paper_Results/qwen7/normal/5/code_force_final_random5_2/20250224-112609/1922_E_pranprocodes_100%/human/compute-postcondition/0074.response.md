Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -99990000, `ans` is a list containing 99999997, and `t` is 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max` (which is 99999997) to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` now contains the value 99999997.
