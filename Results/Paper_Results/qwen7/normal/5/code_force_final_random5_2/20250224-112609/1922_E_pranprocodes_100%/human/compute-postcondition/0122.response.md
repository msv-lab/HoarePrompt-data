Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 3, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999 and may be increased by 1, `min` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999 and may be increased by 1, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, and `ans` now contains `min`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(min)` appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Since `min` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, the list `ans` now includes this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
