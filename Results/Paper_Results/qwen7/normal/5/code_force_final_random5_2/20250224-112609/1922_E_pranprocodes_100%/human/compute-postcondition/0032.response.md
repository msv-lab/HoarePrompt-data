Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is 0, `max` is 99999898, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing [99999899], `t` is 1, `x` is 0**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides `x` by 2 using integer division. Given that `x` was initially 0, dividing 0 by 2 still results in 0. All other variables (`i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`) remain unchanged.
