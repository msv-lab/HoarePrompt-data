Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.**

The code simply initializes the variable `t` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
