Output State: `i` is 2, `x` is 1, `max` is -100000000, `min` is 100000000, `ans` is a list containing integers from -100000000 to 100000000 (inclusive), `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1. During each iteration, depending on whether `x` is even or odd, either `max` or `min` is updated, and `x` is modified accordingly. The process continues until `x` eventually reaches 1. At this point, the loop terminates. The list `ans` will contain all the values of `max` and `min` encountered during the iterations, ranging from -100000000 to 100000000, and `t` will be the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1.
