Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is adjusted based on whether `x` is even or odd, `min` is adjusted accordingly, `ans` is a list containing either 99999997 or -99990000, and `t` is 2. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is reduced by 1, and `ans` contains 99999997. If `x` is odd, `x` is reduced by 1, `min` is reduced by 1, and `ans` contains -99990000.
