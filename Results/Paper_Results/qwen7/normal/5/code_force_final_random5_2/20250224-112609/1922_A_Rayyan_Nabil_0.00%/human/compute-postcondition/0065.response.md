Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`.
- `l` will be 'YES'.
- `c` is an input string.
- `n` must be a positive integer.
- The condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` must be true for every `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

The `print(l)` statement will print the value of `l`, which is explicitly stated to be 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
