Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true, so `n` must remain greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be adjusted to 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**.
