Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `l` will be 'YES', `c` will be an input string, `n` must be a positive integer, and the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` must be true for every `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The variable `l` will be set to 'YES'. The variable `c` will hold the value of the last input string received during the loop's execution. The variable `n` will be a positive integer representing the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. For every index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the characters at the same index in strings `a` and `b` must both differ from the character at the same index in string `c`.
