Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `l` will be 'YES', `c` will be the last input string, `n` must be a positive integer, and the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` must be true for every `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the value of `i` will match the final value of `n`, `l` will be set to 'YES' if the specified condition holds for all characters in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their last input values, and `n` will hold the last value it was assigned during the loop.
