Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `t` must be greater than `i_prev + 1`, `l` is 'YES', `c` is an input string, `n` must be a positive integer, and the condition `a[i_prev + 1] != c[i_prev + 1] and b[i_prev + 1] != c[i_prev + 1]` must still be false.**

Explanation: The line `l = 'YES'` simply reassigns the value of `l` to `'YES'`. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `i`, `t`, `c`, `n`, and the condition remain unchanged from their initial states.
