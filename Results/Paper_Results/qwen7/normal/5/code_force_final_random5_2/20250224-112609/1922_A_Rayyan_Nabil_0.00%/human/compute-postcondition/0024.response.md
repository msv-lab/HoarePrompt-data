Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is 'YES'.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` and `i` starts from 0 in the range function, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` (which is now `n`) must be less than `t` for the loop to continue.
   - Therefore, `n` (which is `i` at the end of the previous iteration) must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` (now `n+1`) less than `t`.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `t` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
   - `i` (which is now `n` at the end of the previous iteration) is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n + 1`.
   - `n` is updated to `n + 1`.
   - `l` remains 'YES' as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `l` is 'YES'.**
