Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is 'YES', `a` is an input string, `b` is the value of the input provided by the user.**

The code `b = input()` assigns the value of the input provided by the user to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
