Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, and `l` is 'YES'**.

The code `l = 'YES'` does not change the values of `t`, `i`, or `n`. It only updates the value of `l` to 'YES', which was already its value in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
