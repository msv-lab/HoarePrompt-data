Based on the initial state provided:

- The variable `i` is equal to `n`.
- The variable `l` is set to 'NO'.
- All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n`) retain their original values from the initial state.

The print statement is `print(l)`, which will simply output the value of `l`.

Output: **'NO'**
