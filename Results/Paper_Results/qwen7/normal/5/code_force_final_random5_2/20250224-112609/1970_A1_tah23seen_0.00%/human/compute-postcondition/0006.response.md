Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within the string `s`, the character at index `i` in string `s` is an opening parenthesis ('('), and `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] + 1`**.

This means that the value of `d[i + 1]` has been updated to be one more than the value of `d[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
