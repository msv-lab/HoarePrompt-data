Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - A dictionary `d` is used to store the balance at each position.
   - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`.
   - A loop iterates over the string `s` to fill the dictionary `d` with the balance at each position.
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - The dictionary `d` is then modified to remove the entry for the length of the string `n`.
   - The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the balance values in ascending order and positions in descending order.
   - The sorted dictionary items are iterated over, and the corresponding characters from the original string `s` are appended to `ans`.

### Issues in the Given Program

1. **Sorting Dictionary Items:**
   - The current implementation sorts the dictionary items using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])`, which sorts by balance but does not handle the tie-breaking by position correctly.
   - The sorting should ensure that if two positions have the same balance, the one with the higher position comes first.

2. **Handling Ties in Sorting:**
   - The lambda function `key=lambda x: x[1]` only considers the balance value, but it should also consider the position in descending order when balances are equal.

### Corrected Implementation

To fix the issue, we need to modify the sorting key to include both the balance and the position in descending order for ties.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {0: 0}
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    # Sort by balance in ascending order and position in descending order for ties
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, _) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans
```

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation due to the issue with sorting. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
