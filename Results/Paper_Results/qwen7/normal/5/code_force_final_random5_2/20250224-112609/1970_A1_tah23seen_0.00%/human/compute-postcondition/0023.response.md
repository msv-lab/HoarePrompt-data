Output State: **The dictionary `d` has the key `n` removed. Each remaining key's value represents the cumulative count of parentheses from the start of the string `s` up to that index, starting from 0 for the first index.**

This means that the dictionary `d` no longer contains the key `n`, but all other keys and their corresponding values remain unchanged. The values of these keys continue to represent the cumulative count of parentheses as described in the initial state.
