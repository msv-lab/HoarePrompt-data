Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i + 2`, `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] - 1`**

Explanation: The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1` updates the dictionary `d` such that the key `i + 1` is assigned the value of `d[i] - 1`. However, since the initial value of `i` is not specified, we only know that `i` is `i + 2` from the initial state. The exact values of `d[i]` and `d[i + 1]` are not given, so we express the updated state in terms of these variables. The string `s` remains unchanged.
