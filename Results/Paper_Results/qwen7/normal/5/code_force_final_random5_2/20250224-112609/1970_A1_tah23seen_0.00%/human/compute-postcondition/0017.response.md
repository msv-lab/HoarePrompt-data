Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i + 2`, `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] + 1`**

Explanation: The code `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the dictionary `d` such that the key `i + 1` is assigned the value of `d[i] + 1`. However, since the initial value of `i` is not explicitly given, we only know that `i` is `i + 2` from the initial state. The exact values of `d[i]` and `d[i + 1]` are not specified, but we know the relationship between them. The string `s` remains unchanged.
