The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. It then sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` and adjusts `k` accordingly. For each subsequent element in `nums`, it assigns the value of `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` while decrementing `k`. After the loop, if `k` is still positive, it adds the remaining value of `k` to `nums[0]`. Finally, it returns the list `nums` where the first element is `nums[0] + k`, and all other elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, with `k` guaranteed to be less than or equal to 0.
