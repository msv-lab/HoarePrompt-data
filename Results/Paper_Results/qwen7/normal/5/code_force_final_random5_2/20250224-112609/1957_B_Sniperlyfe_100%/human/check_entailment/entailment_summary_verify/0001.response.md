### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the function `func_1` based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Initialization of `nums[0]`:**
   - The value `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` is indeed the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1. This part is correct.

2. **Subsequent Values:**
   - The logic of setting `nums[i]` to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` ensures that each subsequent number is as large as possible while keeping the total sum `k` and maximizing the bitwise OR result. However, this approach might not always produce the optimal solution. Let's consider a few edge cases and examples to verify this.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider the example where `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The optimal solution would be `[1, 2]` because `1 | 2 = 3` (binary `1 | 10 = 11`), which has two 1s in its binary representation. However, the current implementation would set `nums[0]` to `1` (since `3.bit_length() - 1 = 2` and `1 << 1 - 1 = 1`) and then set `nums[1]` to `min(1 + 1, 3) = 2`. This works in this specific case but let's consider another scenario.

   - Consider `n = 2` and `k = 5`. The optimal solution would be `[4, 1]` because `4 | 1 = 5` (binary `100 | 001 = 101`), which has three 1s in its binary representation. However, the current implementation would set `nums[0]` to `1` and then set `nums[1]` to `min(1 + 1, 5) = 2`, resulting in `[1, 2]` which has only two 1s in the bitwise OR result.

4. **General Case Analysis:**
   - The current implementation does not guarantee that the bitwise OR result is maximized. It simply sets each subsequent number to the smallest possible value that keeps the total sum `k` and does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR result.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem in all cases. While it may work for some specific cases, it does not guarantee the optimal solution for all inputs.

**Final: False**
