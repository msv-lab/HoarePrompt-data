Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is `k - (min(nums[0] + 1, k) + nums[i])`, `nums[i]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains 2. The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `nums[i]` from it. Given that `nums[i]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, the new value of `k` becomes `k - (min(nums[0] + 1, k) + nums[i])`. The value of `nums[i]` remains unchanged and is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`.
