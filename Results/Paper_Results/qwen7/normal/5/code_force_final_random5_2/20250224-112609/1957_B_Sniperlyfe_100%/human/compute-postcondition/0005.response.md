Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and `k` is greater than 0; `nums[i]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` to `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `nums[i]` refers to `nums[1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
