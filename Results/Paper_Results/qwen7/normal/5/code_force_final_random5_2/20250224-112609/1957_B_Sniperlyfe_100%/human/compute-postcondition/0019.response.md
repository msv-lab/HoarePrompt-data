Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be less than or equal to 0, and `nums` will be a list where the first element `nums[0]` is equal to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and all other elements `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will be equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` as long as `k > 0`. If `k` becomes 0 or negative before the loop completes, the remaining elements in `nums` will be 0.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the index `i` will have reached the length of the list `nums` (`n`). The value of `k` will be depleted to zero or a negative number, and the list `nums` will have been populated according to the rules specified within the loop.
