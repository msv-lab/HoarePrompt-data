Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Setup**: The function `func_1` correctly initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. This is a good starting point for constructing the required sequence.

2. **Setting the First Element**: The first element `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits. This step ensures that the first element contributes significantly to the bitwise OR result.

3. **Adjusting `k` and Filling Remaining Elements**: The function then iterates through the rest of the list, setting each element to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. This ensures that the values are as large as possible without exceeding `k`. If `k` becomes 0 or negative during this process, the remaining elements are set to 0.

4. **Final Adjustment**: After the loop, if `k` is still positive, it means that `k` was not fully used in the previous steps. Therefore, the remaining value of `k` is added to `nums[0]`.

5. **Return Statement**: The function returns the list `nums` where the first element is adjusted to include the remaining value of `k`, and all other elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The sum of the elements in `nums` is `k` because the initial adjustment of `nums[0]` and the subsequent adjustments ensure that the total sum remains `k`.
   - The bitwise OR operation of the elements in `nums` will maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation because the first element `nums[0]` is the largest possible number with `k.bit_length()` bits, and the subsequent elements are either 0 or close to this value.

Given the logic and the steps taken by the function, the program should produce the correct sequence of numbers for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
