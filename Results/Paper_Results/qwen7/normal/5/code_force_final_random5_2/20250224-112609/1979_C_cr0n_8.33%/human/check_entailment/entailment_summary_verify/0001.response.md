### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step using the function summary and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   cases = int(input())
   for n in range(cases):
       func_1()
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.

2. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def func_1():
       N = int(input().strip())
       vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
       prod = 1
       for r in vals:
           prod *= r
       vprod = [prod // r for r in vals]
       den = prod - sum(vprod)
       if den <= 0:
           print(-1)
           return
       print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
   ```

   - `N` is the number of outcomes.
   - `vals` stores the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
   - `prod` calculates the product of all multipliers.
   - `vprod` calculates the value to bet on each outcome as `prod // k_i`.
   - `den` calculates the difference between the total product and the sum of `vprod`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` because the total bet would not be strictly less than the winnings.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Bets:**
   - The program calculates `vprod` as `prod // k_i`. This approach does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.
   - For example, consider the case where `k_i` values are very large. The product `prod` could be extremely large, making `vprod` very small, which might not satisfy the condition.

2. **No Check for Feasibility:**
   - The program does not check if the calculated `vprod` values are feasible (i.e., whether they meet the condition that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome).

### Example Test Case Analysis:
Let's take the example from the problem statement:
- **Test Case 1:** `3 3 2 7`
  - `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
  - `vprod = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
  - `den = 42 - 41 = 1`
  - Since `den > 0`, it prints `14 21 6`, but this does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. One way to achieve this is to use a different approach, such as binary search or a greedy algorithm to find the minimum possible bet that satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
