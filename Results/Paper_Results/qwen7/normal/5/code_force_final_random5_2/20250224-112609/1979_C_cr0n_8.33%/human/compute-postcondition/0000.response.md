Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50.**

The code `N = int(input().strip())` reads an integer input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace (if present), and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The variable `N` now holds the value of the input integer, which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 50 inclusive.
