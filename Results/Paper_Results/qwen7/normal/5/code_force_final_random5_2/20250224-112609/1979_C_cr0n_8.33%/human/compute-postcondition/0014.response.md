Based on the initial state provided:

- `prod` is equal to the product of all elements in the original `vals` list.
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50.
- `vals` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.
- `vprod` is a list containing the values of `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
- `den` is equal to `prod - sum(vprod)`.
- The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

Given this information, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print(-1)
```

Since the print statement directly outputs `-1` without referencing any variables or objects whose values are unknown or need to be derived from the given conditions, the output will simply be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
