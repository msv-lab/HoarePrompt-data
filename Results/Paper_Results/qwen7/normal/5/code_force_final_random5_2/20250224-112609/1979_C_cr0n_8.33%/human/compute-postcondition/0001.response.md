Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `vals` by splitting the input string into individual elements, converting each element to an integer, and storing them in the list. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged from their initial state.
