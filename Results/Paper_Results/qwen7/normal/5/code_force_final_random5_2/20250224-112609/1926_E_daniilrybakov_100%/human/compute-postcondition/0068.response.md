Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is \(2^t\), `x` is 1, `s` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `s = 0` sets the variable `s` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
