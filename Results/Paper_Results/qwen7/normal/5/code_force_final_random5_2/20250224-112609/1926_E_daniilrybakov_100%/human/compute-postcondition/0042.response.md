Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is halved from its current value, `k` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the condition `s < k and k <= s + x` is true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement has been executed, which means we have exited the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, or `x`. The conditions and values associated with these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
