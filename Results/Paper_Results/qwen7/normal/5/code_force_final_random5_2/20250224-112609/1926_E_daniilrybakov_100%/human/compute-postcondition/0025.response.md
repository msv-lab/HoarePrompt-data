Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4, `n` is now `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s` + `x`, `m` is 4, `x` is (n + 1) // 2, and `s` is increased by `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. All the initial conditions and variable assignments remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.
