Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is the integer value of `n` divided by 2 (using floor division), `k` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\), `s` is 0, and if `s` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `s + x, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
