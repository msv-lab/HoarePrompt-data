Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `x` is (`n + 1`) // 2**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`, which means `n` is now divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest whole number. The value of `x` remains unchanged because the code only modifies `n`. Initially, `x` was defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, and since `n` has been halved, `x` does not get recalculated. Therefore, `x` still holds its original value based on the initial `n`.
