Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is now `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is (n + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged. The value of `x` is recalculated based on the new value of `n` since `x` was previously defined as `(n + 1) // 2`.
