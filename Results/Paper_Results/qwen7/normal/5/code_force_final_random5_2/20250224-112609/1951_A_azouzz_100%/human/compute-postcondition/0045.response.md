Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, `t` is decreased by 1 again. Otherwise, if the string `s` contains '11', `t` is decreased by 1 once more. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.
