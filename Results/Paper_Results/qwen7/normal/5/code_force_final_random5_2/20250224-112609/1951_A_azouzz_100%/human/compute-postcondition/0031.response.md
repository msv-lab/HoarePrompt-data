Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `n` is reassigned the value of the integer input from the user. The value of `t` is decreased by 1, but its exact value is not specified, only that it is greater than 0 before being decreased. The value of `s` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet.
