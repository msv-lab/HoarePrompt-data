Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, `n` will be an input integer for the last iteration, `s` will be the string input for the last iteration, and `cnt1` will be the number of '1's in `s` for the last iteration.**

Explanation: The loop runs `t` times. Each time through the loop, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0. The values of `n` and `s` will correspond to the inputs from the last iteration of the loop, and `cnt1` will be the count of '1's in the string `s` from the last iteration, based on the conditions provided in the loop body.
