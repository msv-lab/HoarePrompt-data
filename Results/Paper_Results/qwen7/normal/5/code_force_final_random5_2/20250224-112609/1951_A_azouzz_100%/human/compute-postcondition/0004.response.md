Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`**.

The code `cnt1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of times the character '1' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `cnt1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
