Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string. If `cnt1` equals 1, then the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is less than or equal to 2 or odd. Otherwise, the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is greater than 2 or even, and the substring '11' either exists in `s` or the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is less than or equal to 2 or odd.
