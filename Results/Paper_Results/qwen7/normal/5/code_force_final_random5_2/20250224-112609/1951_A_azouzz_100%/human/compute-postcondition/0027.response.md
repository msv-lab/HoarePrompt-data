Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string. If the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is less than or equal to 2 or odd, and `cnt1` is greater than 2, then `cnt1` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `cnt1` equals 1, the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is still less than or equal to 2 or odd. If `cnt1` is greater than 1, the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is greater than 2 or even, and the substring '11' either exists in `s` or the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is less than or equal to 2 or odd.
