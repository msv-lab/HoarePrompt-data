Output State: **`count_a` is a dictionary with the key `num` and value `1`, `num` has any initial value.**

Explanation: The code `count_a[num] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `num` in the dictionary `count_a`. The initial value of `num` remains unchanged, but now it is associated with the value `1` in the dictionary.
