Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game dynamics as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score you can get by simply counting how many numbers appear exactly twice in your hand. However, this approach does not account for Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

According to the problem description, Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. In this case, Nene would play as follows:

1. You play a card with 1, and Nene plays a card with 1, scoring 0 points for you.
2. You play a card with 2, and Nene plays a card with 2, scoring 0 points for you.
3. You play a card with 3, and Nene plays a card with 3, scoring 0 points for you.

Thus, you can only get 0 points, not 1 as the program incorrectly outputs.

Therefore, the program does not handle the optimal strategy of Nene correctly and hence is incorrect.
