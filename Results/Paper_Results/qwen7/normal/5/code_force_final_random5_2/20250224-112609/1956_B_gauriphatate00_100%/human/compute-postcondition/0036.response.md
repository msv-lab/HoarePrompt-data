Output State: **`max_score` is 2, `num` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `num` (which is 3) is in `count_a`**

The code `max_score += 1` increments the value of `max_score` by 1. Since `max_score` was initially 1, after executing this line, `max_score` becomes 2. The values of `num` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `num` (which is 3) is in `count_a` also remains valid.
