Output State: **`count_a[num]` is now 1, `num` is not defined (or any initial value), and `count_a` is an empty dictionary except for the key `num` which now has a value of 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `num` in the dictionary `count_a`. Since `count_a` was initially an empty dictionary, the line `count_a[num] += 1` adds a new key-value pair to `count_a` where the key is `num` and the value is 1. The variable `num` itself is not defined or modified by this code snippet, so it retains its initial value (or remains undefined).
