Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The provided execution summary suggests that the function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the maximum score based on the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. Specifically, the function only checks if any integer appears exactly twice in the list `a` and increments the score by 1 if it does. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for the optimal strategy of both players.

According to the problem statement, Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. This means that Nene will try to prevent you from scoring points whenever possible. The function should consider this strategic behavior, but the current implementation does not do so.

To correctly solve the problem, the function needs to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players. The function should keep track of the cards on the table and simulate each turn to determine the best move for Nene and the resulting score for you.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
