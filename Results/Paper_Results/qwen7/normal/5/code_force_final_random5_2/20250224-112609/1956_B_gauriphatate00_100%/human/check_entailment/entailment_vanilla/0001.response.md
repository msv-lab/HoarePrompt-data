Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves two players, you and Nene, playing a card game. Each player starts with `n` cards, and the goal is to maximize your score by strategically choosing which card to play on each turn. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers on your cards.
   - It calls the function `func_1(a, n)` to compute the maximum score you can achieve.
   - The function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each number in your hand using a dictionary.
   - It then calculates the maximum score you can achieve by checking how many numbers appear exactly twice in your hand, as each such number allows you to score a point if Nene has not played it yet.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct because:
     - Counting the occurrences of each number helps identify which numbers you can play to score points.
     - Adding 1 to `max_score` for each number that appears exactly twice ensures you only score points when you can guarantee a point (i.e., when Nene doesn't have the same card).
   - However, this logic does not account for the optimal strategy of Nene. The problem states that Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. This means that even if a number appears twice in your hand, Nene might still play it first if it benefits her more in the long run.

4. **Optimal Strategy Consideration**:
   - The current implementation does not simulate Nene's optimal strategy. It assumes that you can always play a card to score a point if it appears twice in your hand, which is not necessarily true since Nene might play the same card first to prevent you from scoring.
   - Therefore, the current logic does not fully capture the complexity of the problem where Nene's actions directly influence your score.

Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Nene, and thus, it does not accurately determine the maximum number of points you can get. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
