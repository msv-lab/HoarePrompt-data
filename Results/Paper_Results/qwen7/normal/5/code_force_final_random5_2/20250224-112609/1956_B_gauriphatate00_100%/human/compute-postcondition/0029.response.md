Output State: **`max_score` is 1, `num` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, and `num` is in `count_a`**

The code `max_score += 1` increments the value of `max_score` by 1. Initially, `max_score` is 0, so after executing this line, `max_score` becomes 1. The values of `num`, `n`, and the condition that `num` is in `count_a` remain unchanged.
