Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list starting with 1000 followed by the cumulative sum of `T` up to `n-2`, `result` is the string "1000" joined with spaces and converted from the list `a`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `line` is the user-inputted string converted to a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` joins the elements of the list `a` into a single string with each element converted to a string and separated by a space. Since `a` starts with 1000 and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list `T`, the `result` variable now holds a string representation of the list `a` with elements separated by spaces. All other variables remain unchanged.
