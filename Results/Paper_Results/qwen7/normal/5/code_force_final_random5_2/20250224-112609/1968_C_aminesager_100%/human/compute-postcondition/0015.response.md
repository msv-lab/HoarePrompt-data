Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than `n-1`, `a` is a list starting with `[1000]` followed by the sum of the elements from `T` up to the `(n-2)`th index, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, so after all iterations, `i` remains `n-1`.
- The condition `n > i` must hold true for the loop to run until `i = n-1`.
- Each iteration appends to `a` the value of the previous element plus the corresponding element from `T`. Therefore, `a` will have `n` elements, with the last element being the cumulative sum of `1000` and the elements of `T` from `T[0]` to `T[n-2]`.
- The `result` variable is a string created by joining the elements of `a` with spaces. Since `a` contains `n` elements, `result` will be a string with `n` space-separated numbers.
