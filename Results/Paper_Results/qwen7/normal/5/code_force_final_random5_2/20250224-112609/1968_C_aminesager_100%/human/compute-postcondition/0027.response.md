Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `a` is updated such that its last element is now the sum of the second last element of `a` and the element at index `i-1` of `T`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 until `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n-2`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from `n-2` to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n-1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - `i` will be `n-1` at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - `a` and `T` are not directly modified by the loop head; their states remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` is updated such that its last element is now the sum of the second last element of `a` and the element at index `i-1` of `T`**.
