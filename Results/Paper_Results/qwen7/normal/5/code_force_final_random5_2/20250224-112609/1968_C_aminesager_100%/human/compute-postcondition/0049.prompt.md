Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than `n-1`, `a` is a list starting with `[1000]` followed by the sum of the elements from `T` up to the `(n-2)`th index, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is `-1`, `a` is a list starting with 1000 and then each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list starting with 1000 followed by the cumulative sum of `T` up to `n-2`, `result` is the string "1000" joined with spaces and converted from the list `a`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `line` is the user-inputted string converted to a list of integers.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
