Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` contains an element that is equal to `a[2] + T[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends to the list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `a[i - 1]` evaluates to `a[2]`, and `T[i - 1]` evaluates to `T[2]`. Since `i` is 3 and `n` must be greater than 3, the value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, `a` now contains an additional element which is the sum of `a[2]` and `T[2]`.
