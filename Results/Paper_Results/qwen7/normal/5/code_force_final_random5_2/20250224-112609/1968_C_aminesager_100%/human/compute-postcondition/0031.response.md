Output State: **`i` is `-1`, `a` is a list starting with 1000 and then each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code does not modify the values of `i` or `a`. Instead, it creates a string `result` by joining the elements of list `a` with spaces. Since `a` starts with 1000 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `T`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. The variable `i` is also unchanged and is set to `-1`. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `i` and `a`, and the newly created string `result` which contains the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
