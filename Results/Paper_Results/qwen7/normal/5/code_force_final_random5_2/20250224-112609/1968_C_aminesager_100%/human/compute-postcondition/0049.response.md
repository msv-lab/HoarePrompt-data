Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `t` becomes 0. After all iterations, `t` will be `0`. For each iteration, `n` will be set to a new input integer greater than 1, and `a` will be updated to contain the cumulative sums starting from 1000. The final `result` will be a string of these cumulative sums separated by spaces for each value of `n` processed. The exact content of `result` depends on the sequence of inputs provided for each `n`.

To summarize, after all iterations, `t` will be `0`, `n` will be the last input integer greater than 1 processed, `a` will be the final list of cumulative sums for that `n`, and `result` will be the string representation of the final list `a`.
