Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is [1000, 2000 + T[0]], `result` is "1000", `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `line` is the user-inputted string converted to a list of integers**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`, which is `1000 + T[0]`. Thus, `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 + T[0]] + (1000 + T[0])`, resulting in `[1000, 2000 + T[0]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
