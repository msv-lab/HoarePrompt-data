Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from `i=0` to `i=t-1`), and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers entered on the last iteration of the loop.

This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will still hold its initial value (an integer between 1 and 1000), `i` will be set to `t-1` (which is 999 if `t` was 1000), and `a`, `b`, and `c` will contain the values of the last set of integers entered by the user during any of the loop iterations.
