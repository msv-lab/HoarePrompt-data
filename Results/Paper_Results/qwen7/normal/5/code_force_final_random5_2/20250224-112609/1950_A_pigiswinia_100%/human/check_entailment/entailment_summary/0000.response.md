Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It then iterates through each test case, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
- The program checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`).
- If either condition is met, it prints the corresponding string ('STAIR' or 'PEAK').
- If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
- The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all given examples correctly.
- There are no logical errors or omissions that would cause incorrect outputs based on the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
