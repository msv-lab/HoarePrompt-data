Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them to integers, then assigns these values to `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
