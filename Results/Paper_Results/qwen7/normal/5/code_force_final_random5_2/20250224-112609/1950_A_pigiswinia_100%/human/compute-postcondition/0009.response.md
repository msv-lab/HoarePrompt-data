Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers.
- The condition `a >= b` or `b >= c` holds.
- The value of `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

The `print` statement is printing a string literal `'PEAK'`. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not affect this print statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

Output: **'PEAK'**
