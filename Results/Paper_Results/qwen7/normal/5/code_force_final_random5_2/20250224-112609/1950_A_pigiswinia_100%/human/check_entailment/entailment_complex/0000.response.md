Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. If the conditions are met, it prints the corresponding string ("STAIR" or "PEAK").
5. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
6. The logic within the function matches the problem description perfectly.

Given the annotated program and the reasoning above, the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
