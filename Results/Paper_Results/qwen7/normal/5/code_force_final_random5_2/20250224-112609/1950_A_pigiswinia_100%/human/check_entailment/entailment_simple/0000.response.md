### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This matches the problem description where `t` is the number of test cases and each test case consists of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. This ensures that the input is processed as required.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'NONE'.

4. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs `t` times, processing each test case sequentially. The loop variable `i` is used to iterate through the test cases, but its value does not affect the correctness of the logic since the logic inside the loop is independent of `i`.

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each test case as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
