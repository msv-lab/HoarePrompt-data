### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Input**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c`. This is correct because it ensures that the digits form a staircase pattern.
   - **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `a < b > c`. This is also correct because it ensures that the digits form a peak pattern.
   - **Neither Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NONE". This is correct as well.
4. **Output**: The program outputs the correct string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case based on the conditions.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all possible inputs as specified, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
