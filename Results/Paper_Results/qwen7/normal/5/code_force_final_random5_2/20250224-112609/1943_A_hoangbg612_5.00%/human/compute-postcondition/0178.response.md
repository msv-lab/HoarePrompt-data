Output State: **`cur` is i, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently inside, while the value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and the value of `cur` remains as the previous value of `i`.
