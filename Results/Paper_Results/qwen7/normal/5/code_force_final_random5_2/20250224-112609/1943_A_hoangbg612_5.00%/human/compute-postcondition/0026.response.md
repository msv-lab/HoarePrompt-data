Output State: **`num` is the next integer from the list `N`, `cur` is increased by 1, and `cur` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the current value of `num` to `cur`. Since `num` is the next integer from the list `N` and `cur` was increased by 1 before this line, after executing this line, `cur` will now be equal to `num`. The precondition that `num` is the next integer from the list `N` remains valid.
