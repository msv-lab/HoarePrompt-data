Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the elements of the list `N`. Therefore, the objects involved in the loop head are `num` (the variable used to hold each element of `N` during each iteration) and `N` (the list being iterated over).

2. **Determine the initial state of `num`**: Since the loop has not started yet, `num` has not taken on any value from the list `N`. It will take on the values of the elements of `N` one by one as the loop progresses.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements left in the list `N`. This means that `N` must contain at least one element for the loop to start.

4. **Adjust the given states**: The given states are:
   - `cur` is -1
   - `_` is 1
   - `S` is an input integer
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers
   - `M` is an empty dictionary

   We need to adjust the states of `N` and `num` to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `N` must contain at least one element, and `num` will take on the value of the first element of `N` when the loop starts.

5. **Final state adjustment**: Based on the above reasoning, the state needs to be adjusted such that `N` contains at least one element, and `num` is set to the first element of `N`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`cur` is -1, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `num` is the first element of `N`**.
