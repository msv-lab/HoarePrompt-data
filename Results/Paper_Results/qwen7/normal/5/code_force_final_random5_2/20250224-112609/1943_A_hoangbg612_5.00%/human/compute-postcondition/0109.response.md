Output State: **`cur` is the largest number in `N` plus 1, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and `M[cur-1]` is the count of how many times `cur-1` appears in `N`. The sum of all values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`**.

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. Since `cur` was the largest number in the list `N`, after incrementing, `cur` becomes the next number in the sequence, which is one more than the largest number in `N`. The values of `_`, `S`, `N`, and the count of `cur-1` in `N` (which is now `cur` before the increment) remain unchanged.
