Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `M[cur]` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to `M[cur]`. Since `cur` is equal to `num`, `M[num]` is set to 1. The values of the other variables (`_`, `S`, `N`) remain unchanged, and we continue to be outside of the most internal loop or if statement.
