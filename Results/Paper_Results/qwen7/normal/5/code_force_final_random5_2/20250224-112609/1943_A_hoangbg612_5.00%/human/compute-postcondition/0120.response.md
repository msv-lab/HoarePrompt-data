Postcondition: `M` is a list of integers, `i` is within the bounds of `M`, and `cur` is equal to `i`. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged when `M[i]` is not less than or equal to `i`.
