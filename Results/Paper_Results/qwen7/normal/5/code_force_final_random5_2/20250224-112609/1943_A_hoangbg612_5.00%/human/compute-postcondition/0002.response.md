Output State: **`T` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `S` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `S = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `S`. The variable `T` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
