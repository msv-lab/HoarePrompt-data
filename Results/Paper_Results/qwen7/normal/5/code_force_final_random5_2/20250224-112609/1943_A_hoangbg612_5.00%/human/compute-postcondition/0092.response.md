Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and `M[cur]` is 1.**

The code assigns the value `1` to `M[cur]`. Since `cur` is equal to `num`, `M[num]` is now `1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement (`if num > cur + 1`) is not relevant to the current code execution, so it remains as a precondition without being affected.
