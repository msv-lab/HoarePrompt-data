Output State: **`num` is the next integer from the list `N`, `cur` is `num`, `M[cur]` is 1, and `M[4]` is either 1 or 2.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` changes the value of `M[cur]` to 1. Since `cur` is equal to `num`, `M[num]` is now 1. The values of `num`, `cur`, and `M[4]` remain unchanged.
