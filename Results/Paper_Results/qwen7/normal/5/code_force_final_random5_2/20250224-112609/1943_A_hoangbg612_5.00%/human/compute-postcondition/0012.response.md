Output State: **`cur` is an integer greater than `num` by less than 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are updated or reassigned, `cur` remains an integer greater than `num` by less than 1, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it was in.
