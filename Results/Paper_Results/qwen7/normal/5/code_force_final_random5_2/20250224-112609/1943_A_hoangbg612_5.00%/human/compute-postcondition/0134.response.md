Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `num` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `cur` is -1 (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `i` is `i + 1` (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `S` is an input integer (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.
   - `M` is an empty dictionary (not directly relevant to the loop).

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `N`. For the loop to execute, `N` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the list `N` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `N` has at least one element before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `N` to ensure it has at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element**
