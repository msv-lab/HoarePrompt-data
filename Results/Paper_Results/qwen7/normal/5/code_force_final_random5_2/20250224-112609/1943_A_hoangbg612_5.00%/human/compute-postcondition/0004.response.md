Output State: **`T` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `N.sort()` sorts the list `N` in ascending order. The values of `T` and `S` remain unchanged. The list `N` is updated to be sorted.
