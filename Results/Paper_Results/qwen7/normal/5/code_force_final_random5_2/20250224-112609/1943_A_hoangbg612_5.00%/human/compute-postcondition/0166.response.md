Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `N` is a sorted list of integers. `cur` will hold the last maximum value encountered in the list `N`, and `M[cur]` will be the count of how many times this maximum value appears in the list. For any other value less than `cur`, the count in `M` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence.**

This means that after the loop completes, `cur` will be the highest number in the list `N`, and `M[cur]` will indicate how many times this highest number appears. All other numbers in the list will also have their counts recorded in `M` based on their occurrences.
