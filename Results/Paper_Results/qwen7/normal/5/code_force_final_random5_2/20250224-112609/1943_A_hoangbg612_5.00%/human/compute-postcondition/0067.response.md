Output State: **`cur` remains 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers inputted by the user split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the result in the list `N`. The variables `cur` and `_` remain unchanged, and `S` is still an input integer, which was taken before this line of code.
