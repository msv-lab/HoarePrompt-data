Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `num` and `N`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `N`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element.
   - `num` is the next element in the list.
   - `cur` is the current maximum value encountered so far.
   - `M[cur]` is the count of occurrences of `cur`.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num`, `M[cur]` is set to 2, and the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are elements left in `N`, the next `num` will be the next element in the list `N`.
   - `cur` remains the same unless it is updated in the loop body.
   - `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `num` is not greater than `cur`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element (the next element will be the next item in the list).
- `num` is the next element in the list `N`.
- `cur` is the current maximum value encountered so far (unchanged unless updated in the loop body).
- `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 (unless `num` is greater than `cur`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, `cur` is the current maximum value encountered so far, and `M[cur]` is incremented by 1**.
