Output State: **`cur` is -1, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `num` is the second element of `N`, `M[cur]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Given that `cur` is -1, `M[-1]` is incremented by 1. Since `M` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a dictionary or a list where `M[-1]` is being updated. After the operation, `M[-1]` (or `M[cur]`) becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
