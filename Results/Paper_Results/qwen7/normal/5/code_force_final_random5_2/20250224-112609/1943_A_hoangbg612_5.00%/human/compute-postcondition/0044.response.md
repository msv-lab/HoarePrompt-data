Output State: **`cur` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. The sum of all values in the dictionary `M` (`S`), and the counts of consecutive appearances for each unique integer `k` in `N` (stored in `M[k]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the only updated variable is `cur`, which is now one more than its previous value.
