Output State: **`i` is 0; `cur` is 0**

Initially, `i` is 0 and `cur` is a non-negative integer. The condition that the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to 0 is also valid. After executing `cur = i`, the value of `cur` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `i` is 0; `cur` is 0.
