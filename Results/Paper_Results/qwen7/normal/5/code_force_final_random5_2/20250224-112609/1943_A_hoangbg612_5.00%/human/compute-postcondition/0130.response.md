Output State: **`cur` is the same, `i` is `i + 1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each integer to a string, splits the line into individual strings, converts those strings back to integers, and stores them in a list named `N`. The values of `cur`, `i`, `S`, and `M` are not affected by this operation.
