Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and if `num` (which is the second element of `N`) is greater than `cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains the same, where if `num` (the second element of `N`) is greater than `cur + 1`, we break out of the loop or if statement.
