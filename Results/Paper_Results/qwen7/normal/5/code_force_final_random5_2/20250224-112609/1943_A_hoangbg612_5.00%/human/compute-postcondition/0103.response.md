Output State: **`cur` is `-1` or the current value of `num`, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `num` is the next element in `N`, and `M[cur]` is 2**.

Explanation: The line `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Given that the initial value of `M[cur]` is 1, after executing this line, `M[cur]` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
