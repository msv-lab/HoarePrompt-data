Output State: All integers in the list `N` have been processed, and for each unique integer `k` in `N`, `M[k]` contains the count of how many times `k` appears consecutively without any integer between it and `cur` being larger than `cur + 1`. If no such `k` exists, `M[cur]` will contain the count of consecutive appearances of `cur` until the end of the list `N`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the dictionary `M` will map each unique integer from the list `N` to the number of consecutive occurrences of that integer where no integer in between is greater than `cur + 1`. If there are no such sequences, `M[cur]` will hold the count of consecutive occurrences of `cur` until the end of the list.
