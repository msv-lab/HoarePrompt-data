Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for determining the optimal moves for Alice and Bob to achieve the game's score based on the MEX of the array `c`. Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Alice and Bob's Moves**: 
   - The code assumes that Alice and Bob make their moves in a way that doesn't account for the optimal strategy where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.
   - The sorting of the array `N` and the subsequent loop do not reflect the alternating turns between Alice and Bob as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Logic for Calculating MEX**:
   - The logic for calculating the MEX is flawed. It does not simulate the game's turns properly and instead tries to directly compute the MEX without simulating the game process.

3. **Missing Simulation of Turns**:
   - The solution should simulate the turns of Alice and Bob to ensure that the elements are picked and removed according to the rules of the game. This simulation is missing in the current implementation.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game's turns and keep track of the elements picked by Alice and Bob. Here is a more accurate approach:

1. **Simulate Alice and Bob's Turns**:
   - Alice picks elements from the sorted array and appends them to her list.
   - Bob picks elements from the remaining array and removes them.

2. **Calculate MEX**:
   - After all elements are picked, calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()

        # Alice's turn
        alice_turns = []
        bob_turns = []
        for i in range(S):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                alice_turns.append(N.pop(0))
            else:  # Bob's turn
                bob_turns.append(N.pop(0))

        # Calculate MEX
        mex = 0
        seen = set(alice_turns + bob_turns)
        while mex in seen:
            mex += 1

        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution correctly simulates the game's turns and calculates the MEX of the resulting array `c` after all elements are picked.
