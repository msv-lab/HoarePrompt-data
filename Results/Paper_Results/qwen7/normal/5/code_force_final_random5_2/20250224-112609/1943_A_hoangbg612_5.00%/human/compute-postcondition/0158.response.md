Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, `cur` is incremented by 1, and `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. The initial state includes that `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, and `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. After executing the code, `cur` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `cur` is not specified. The other conditions remain the same.
