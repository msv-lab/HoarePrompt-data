Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the game's final score based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. The score is defined as the MEX of the array `c`.
2. The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game's process as described. Instead, it attempts to find the smallest integer `i` such that the count of `i` in the sorted list `N` is greater than `i` itself. This approach is flawed because:
   - It does not account for the different turn rules for Alice and Bob.
   - It does not ensure that the elements are picked according to the game rules.
   - It does not consider the optimal strategy for both players.
3. The solution incorrectly assumes that the optimal strategy involves finding the smallest integer `i` where the count of `i` in the sorted list is greater than `i`. This is not a valid approach for the game described, as the game involves strategic picking of elements by both players.
4. The provided solution does not handle the game's alternating turns between Alice and Bob, nor does it consider the MEX calculation for the array `c` formed during the game.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
