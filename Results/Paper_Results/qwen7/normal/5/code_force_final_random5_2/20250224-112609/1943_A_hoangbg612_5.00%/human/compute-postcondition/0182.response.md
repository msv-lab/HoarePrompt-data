Output State: **`cur` is equal to `i`, `i` is equal to `i_prev + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `cur = i` assigns the value of `i` to `cur`. Given the initial state, `i` is defined as `i_prev + 2`. Therefore, `cur` becomes `i_prev + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
