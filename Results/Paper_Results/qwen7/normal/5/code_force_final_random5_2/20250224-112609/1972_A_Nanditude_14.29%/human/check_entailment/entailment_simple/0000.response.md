Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure that for every existing problem \(a_i\), its difficulty does not exceed the expected difficulty \(b_i\). A new problem with difficulty \(w\) can be added, which will replace the most difficult problem in the list, and the list will be re-sorted.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It initializes counters and iterates through the arrays `a` and `b` to check if the current problem’s difficulty meets the expected difficulty.
   - If the current problem’s difficulty exceeds the expected difficulty, it removes the most difficult problem and inserts the expected difficulty, then increments the counter.
   - The loop continues until all problems meet their expected difficulties or there are no more problems to process.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function is not used in the main logic of the program and seems to be irrelevant to the problem's requirements.
   - The function sorts the input list in descending order, but this is not necessary for solving the problem as the original lists are already sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the main part of the program is correct. It ensures that the most difficult problem is replaced when necessary and counts the number of replacements.
   - The program handles the constraints and examples provided correctly.

Based on the above analysis, the given program is correct according to the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
