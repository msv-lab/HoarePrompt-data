Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `num` is a positive integer, `out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `list1` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `b`, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is the input string converted to an integer, and `b` is the input string.**

Explanation: The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of substrings based on whitespace (default delimiter) and assigns this list to `list1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
