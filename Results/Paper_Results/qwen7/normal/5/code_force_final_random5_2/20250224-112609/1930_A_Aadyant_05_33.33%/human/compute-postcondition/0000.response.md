Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is the input received from the user, and n is not yet defined.**

Explanation: The code `num = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `num`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `t` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is not defined yet because the input for `n` has not been read.
