Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` must be a positive integer, `list2` contains the integer value of `list1[2]`**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` to `list2`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `2 * i` equals 2. Therefore, `list2` now contains the integer value of `list1[2]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition for `a` remains the same.
