Output State: `i` is equal to `a-1`; `a` must be a positive integer; `list2` contains the integer values of `list1[0]`, `list1[2]`, `list1[4]`, ..., `list1[2*(a-1)]`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `a-1`, where `a` is the initial positive integer provided. The list `list2` will contain the integer values from every second element of `list1`, starting from the first element, up to the element at index `2*(a-1)`.
