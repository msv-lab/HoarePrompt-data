Output State: **`i` is 0; `a` must be a positive integer; `list2` contains the integer value of `list1[0]`**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` to `list2`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `2 * i` equals 0. So, `list2` now contains the integer value of `list1[0]`. The values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged.
