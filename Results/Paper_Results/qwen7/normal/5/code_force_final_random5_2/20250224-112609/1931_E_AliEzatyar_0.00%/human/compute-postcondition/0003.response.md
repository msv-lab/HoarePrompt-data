Output State: **`counter` is 1, `num` must have at least one element, `i` is len(num) - 1, the current value of `num[i]` is '0'**

The code increments the value of `counter` by 1. Initially, `counter` is 0, so after executing `counter += 1`, `counter` becomes 1. The other variables (`num`, `i`, and the current value of `num[i]`) remain unchanged.
