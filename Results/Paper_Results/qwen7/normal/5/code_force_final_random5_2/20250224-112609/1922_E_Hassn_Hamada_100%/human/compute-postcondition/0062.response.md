Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `size - overlap`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is already given as 3.
   - `size` is given as 25.
   - `overlap` is part of the tuple `size_overlap`, which is (25, 3). Therefore, `overlap` is 3.

3. **Calculate the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i in range(size - overlap)`. Substituting the known values:
   - `size - overlap` becomes `25 - 3 = 22`.
   - The loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = 21`.

4. **Check the Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is 3, which is within the range [0, 21]. Therefore, the loop can start executing with `i = 3`.

5. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop can start with `i = 3`, no adjustment is needed for `i`. However, we need to ensure that the expression `size - overlap` evaluates correctly. Given `size` and `overlap` are constants, their values should be correct.

6. **Final State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that the loop can start with the correct initial value of `i` and the correct range calculation.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`size` is 25, `overlap` is 3, `i` is 3** (no adjustment needed for `i` since it is already correct, but the values of `size` and `overlap` must be correct for the loop to execute).

Since `i` is already set to 3 and the range calculation `size - overlap` is correct with the given values, no further adjustments are necessary.
