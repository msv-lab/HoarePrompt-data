Output State: **`size_overlap` is (21, 2), `i` is 3, `size` is 24, `number` must be greater than or equal to 4194296, `value` is 16777214**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `value` to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given that `size` is 24 and `i` is 3, the calculation is `(1 << 24) - (1 << 3)`. This results in `16777216 - 8 = 16777214`. The other variables remain unchanged.
