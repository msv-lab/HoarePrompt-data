### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The solution uses a recursive function `func_1` to generate this array.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses bit manipulation to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The goal is to create a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the target `X`.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When `number == 0`, the function returns immediately, indicating the base case of the recursion.

4. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function iterates backward from the maximum value in the current sequence to 0.
   - For each value `i`, it calculates the size and value of the next segment of the sequence.
   - It checks if the calculated value fits within the remaining `number` and updates the sequence accordingly.
   - The function recursively calls itself with the updated `number` and appends the generated segment to the sequence.

5. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values that ensure the number of increasing subsequences matches the target `X`.
   - The sequence is constructed using powers of 2, which helps in ensuring the correct count of increasing subsequences.

6. **Output**:
   - The length of the generated sequence is printed first.
   - Then, the sequence is printed as space-separated integers.

### Verification:

- **Base Case**: The base case is correctly handled when `number == 0`, returning immediately.
- **Recursive Case**: The function correctly iterates backward and calculates the size and value of the next segment. However, there are issues with the logic used to update the sequence and the recursive calls.
- **Sequence Generation**: The sequence generation logic is flawed. The function does not correctly ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches the target `X`. Specifically, the use of bitwise operations and the way segments are appended do not guarantee the correct count of increasing subsequences.
- **Output**: The output format is correct, but the sequence generated may not meet the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Detailed Issues:
- **Bitwise Operations**: The bitwise operations used to calculate the size and value of segments do not directly translate to the number of increasing subsequences.
- **Segment Appending**: The segments are appended in a way that does not guarantee the correct count of increasing subsequences. The function does not handle the complexity of ensuring the exact number of increasing subsequences.
- **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls do not correctly adjust the `number` to reflect the number of increasing subsequences generated by the current segment.

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed issues with the sequence generation logic, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

### Correctness:

**False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
