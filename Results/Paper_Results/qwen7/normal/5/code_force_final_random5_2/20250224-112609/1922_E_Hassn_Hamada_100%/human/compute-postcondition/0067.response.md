Output State: **`size` is 25, `overlap` is 3, `i` is 5, `sequence` contains [6, 7, 8]**.

The code appends the value of `i + overlap` to the list `sequence`. Given that `i` is 5 and `overlap` is 3, `i + overlap` equals 8. Therefore, the list `sequence` changes from `[6, 7]` to `[6, 7, 8]`. The values of `size` and `overlap` remain unchanged, and `i` remains 5.
