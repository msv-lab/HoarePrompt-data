Output State: **`size_overlap` is (i + 1, i), `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `size` is `i + 1`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `3 * (1 << (i - 1))`, `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`**

Explanation: The code updates `size_overlap` to be a tuple of `size` and `i`. Given the initial conditions, `size` is `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged, so their conditions and values stay the same.
