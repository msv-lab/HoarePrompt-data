You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is a positive integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers where all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_1(number, sequence):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two values, both of which are 0.
    #State: number is a positive integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers where all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The value of number is not 0
    size_overlap = 0, 0
    for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
        size, value = i + 1, (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)
        
        while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
            size += 1
            value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)
        
        if value <= number:
            size_overlap = size, i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `size_overlap` is (25, 3), `i` is 3, `size` is 25, `number` must be greater than or equal to 4194296, `value` is 33554430.
    #
    #This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `size_overlap` has been updated to (25, 3). This means that the final values of `size` and `i` that satisfy the condition within the loop are 25 and 3, respectively. The variable `i` is set to 3 after the loop completes, and `size` is calculated as `i + 1`, which equals 25. Additionally, the condition for `number` must be met, which is being greater than or equal to 4194296. The value of `value` is 33554430, which is the result of the calculation `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` when `size` is 25 and `i` is 3.
    size, overlap = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
        
    #State: Output State: `size` is 25, `overlap` is 3, `i` is 25, `sequence` contains [6, 7, 8, ..., 30].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = size - overlap`, which is `25 - 3 = 22`. Therefore, the loop will execute 22 times. Starting with `i = 3`, each iteration increments `i` by 1, so after 22 iterations, `i` will be `3 + 22 = 25`. Each iteration also appends `i + overlap` (which is `i + 3`) to the `sequence` list, starting from 6 and ending at 30. Thus, the final `sequence` will contain all integers from 6 to 30.
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `number`, which is a positive integer between 2 and 10^18, and a parameter `sequence`, which is a list of integers where each element is within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. After executing the function body, the function returns two values, both of which are 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns two values, both of which are 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
