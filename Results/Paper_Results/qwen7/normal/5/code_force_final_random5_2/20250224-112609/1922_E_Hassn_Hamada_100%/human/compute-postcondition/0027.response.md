Output State: **`size_overlap` is (3, 0), `i` is 2, `size` is 3, `number` must be at least 4, `value` is 6**

Explanation: The code calculates `value` using the expression `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given that `size` is 3 and `i` is 2, the calculation becomes `(1 << 3) - (1 << 2)`, which is `8 - 4 = 6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
