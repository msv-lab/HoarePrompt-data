Output State: **`size_overlap` is (3, 0), `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `size` is `i + 1`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `3 * (1 << (i - 1))`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`**

Explanation: The code `size += 1` increments the value of `size` by 1. Initially, `size` was `i + 1`. Since `i` must be greater than or equal to 1, the new value of `size` is now `i + 2`, which can be expressed as `i + 1 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
