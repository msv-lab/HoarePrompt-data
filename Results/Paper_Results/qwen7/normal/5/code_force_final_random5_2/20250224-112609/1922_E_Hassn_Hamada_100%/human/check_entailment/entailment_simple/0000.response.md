Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to generate an array of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences in the array is exactly `X`. The provided solution seems to use a recursive approach to construct such an array.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses bitwise operations to determine the size and value of the next element to add to the sequence.
   - The function recursively reduces the `number` until it reaches zero, building the sequence along the way.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The function correctly handles the base case where `number` is zero.
   - The loop inside `func_1` calculates the appropriate size and value for the next element in the sequence using bitwise operations.
   - The sequence is built by appending the calculated values to the list `sequence`.

4. **Recursive Call**:
   - The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)` ensures that the function continues to build the sequence until the `number` is reduced to zero.
   - This recursive approach ensures that the sequence is constructed in a way that meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

5. **Output**:
   - The length of the generated sequence is printed first.
   - The sequence itself is then printed.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic to generate a sequence with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The recursive approach ensures that the sequence is built in a manner that satisfies the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
