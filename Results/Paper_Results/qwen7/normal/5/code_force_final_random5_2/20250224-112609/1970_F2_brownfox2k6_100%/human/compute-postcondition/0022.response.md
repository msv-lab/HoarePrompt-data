Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `p` which is iterating over the sorted list `out`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `out`. At the end of the previous iteration, `p` was the next element from the sorted `out`, and `out` must contain at least one element.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**: For the loop to execute one more time, the list `out` must still contain at least one element. Since `p` is set to the next element in each iteration, after the current iteration, `p` will be updated to the next element in the sorted list `out`.

4. **Update the state**: After the current iteration, `p` will be the next element in the sorted `out`, and `out` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `p` will be the next element in the sorted `out`.
- `out` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`p` is the next element from the sorted `out`, `out` must contain at least one element**
