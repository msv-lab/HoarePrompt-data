### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly updates the position of an entity based on the direction provided. The logic is straightforward and handles all possible directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). This function works as intended.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function aims to handle the elimination of players when a Bludger hits them. However, there are indeed some issues with the implementation:
     - **Assumption about `blud`**: The function assumes that `blud` is a key in the `player` dictionary, which is incorrect. `blud` is a list of positions, not a key in the dictionary.
     - **Handling multiple eliminations**: The function iterates over players and checks if their position matches any position in `blud`. If a match is found, the player is marked as eliminated. However, it does not handle the case where multiple players are hit by the Bludger simultaneously. The function should update the positions of all affected players and then sort and print them.
     - **Sorting and printing**: The function sorts players alphabetically before printing their elimination, which is correct. However, the function should ensure that the player's positions are updated correctly before sorting and printing.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic correctly processes the game steps, updating positions and handling scoring and eliminations. However, the issue with `func_2` means that the program might not correctly handle simultaneous eliminations of multiple players by a Bludger.

4. **Overall Correctness**:
   - While the main logic of the program is mostly correct, the function `func_2` has logical flaws that could lead to incorrect behavior in certain scenarios. Specifically, it does not handle simultaneous eliminations properly and incorrectly assumes that `blud` is a key in the `player` dictionary.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate in pointing out the issues with `func_2`. The program cannot be considered fully correct due to these logical flaws. Therefore, the final evaluation should reflect this.

### Final:
**False**
