The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the current time step in the game. It also accepts a parameter `player`, which is a dictionary mapping player identifiers (e.g., 'R0', 'B0') to their current positions (as a list of two integers [x, y]). Additionally, it accepts a parameter `blud`, which is a list of positions (as a list of two integers [x, y]) representing the current positions of the Bludgers.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the current time step, a dictionary `player` mapping player identifiers to their positions, and a list `blud` of Bludger positions. It does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information.**
