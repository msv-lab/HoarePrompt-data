The function `move` takes two parameters: obj, which is a string representing an entity on the field (e.g., a player, the Quaffle, or a Bludger), and d, which is a string indicating the direction of movement (U, D, L, R). The field is represented as a grid with dimensions N x M, where N and M are odd integers between 3 and 99. The field contains entities such as players (R0, R1, ..., B0, B1, etc.), goals (RG, BG), the Quaffle (.Q), and optionally a Bludger (.B). The initial positions of all entities are valid within the grid boundaries.
