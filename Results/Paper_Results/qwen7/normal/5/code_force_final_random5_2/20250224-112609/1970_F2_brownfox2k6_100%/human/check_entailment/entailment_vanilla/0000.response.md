### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function updates the position of an object (likely a player or a ball) based on the direction (`d`).
   - The function correctly adjusts the coordinates based on the direction provided ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R').

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function checks for collisions with Bludgers and eliminates players if they are in the same position as a Bludger.
   - The logic is correct in that it identifies players who are in the same position as a Bludger and marks them for elimination.
   - The players are sorted alphabetically before printing their elimination details, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program needs to process the game steps, update the positions of players and balls, handle collisions, and detect scoring events.
   - The functions provided are part of a larger program that would need to include additional logic for handling the game steps, updating the positions, detecting collisions, and managing the scoring.
   - The provided functions do not cover the entire game logic, such as:
     - Handling the movement and actions of players and balls.
     - Detecting when a player scores a goal.
     - Managing the state of the game over multiple steps.
     - Outputting the final score and events in the correct format.

Given the provided functions, they are logically sound and correctly handle the specific tasks they are designed for. However, the overall correctness of the program depends on how these functions are integrated into a complete solution that handles the entire game logic.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided functions are logically sound and correctly handle their specific tasks, but the overall program structure and additional required logic are not shown, we cannot definitively conclude the correctness of the entire program based solely on the given functions.

**Correctness: False**
