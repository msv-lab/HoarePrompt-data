Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**: The code correctly initializes the field dimensions (`n`, `m`), lists for goals (`rg` and `bg`), the Bludger position (`blud`), and a dictionary for players (`player`). It also initializes the ball position (`ball`) and sets up the carry status (`carry`).
2. **Game Steps Processing**: The code iterates over the game steps (`t`), correctly handling actions like catching (`C`), throwing (`T`), and moving (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`). For each action, it updates the appropriate positions and scores accordingly.
3. **Movement Function (`func_1`)**: The function correctly updates the position of the object based on the direction provided. This function is used for players, the ball, and the Bludger.
4. **Elimination Function (`func_2`)**: The function correctly identifies players who are in the same position as the Bludger, marks them as eliminated, and prints the elimination event. It ensures that the players are marked as eliminated and prints the events in the correct order.
5. **Scoring Logic**: The code correctly handles scoring logic, updating the scores when a player successfully scores in the opponent's goal and resetting the ball position to the center of the field.
6. **Final Score Output**: The code correctly outputs the final score at the end of the game.

Given the above points, the provided code appears to correctly implement the problem description and handle all the necessary functionalities as specified.

Correctness: **True**
