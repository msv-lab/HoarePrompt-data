Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `leftZero` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, or `mid`. Therefore, those variables retain their initial conditions.
