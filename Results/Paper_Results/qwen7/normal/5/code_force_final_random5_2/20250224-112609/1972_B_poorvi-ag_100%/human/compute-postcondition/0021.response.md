Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input from the user, `results` is a list containing 'yes'**.

Explanation: The code appends the string 'yes' to the list `results`. Since `results` was not defined before, it is initialized as a list containing only 'yes'. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
