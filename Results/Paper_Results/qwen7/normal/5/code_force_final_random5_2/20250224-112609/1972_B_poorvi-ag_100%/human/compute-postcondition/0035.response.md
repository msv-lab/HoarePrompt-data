Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting of "U" and "D". It checks if the count of "U" in the string \( s \) is odd. If the count is odd, it appends "yes" to the results list; otherwise, it appends "no". After processing all test cases, it prints the results list, which contains 100 elements, each being either "yes" or "no".**
