Output: **no**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no'. The second element of `results` is assigned to `i`. Therefore, `i` is set to the second element of the `results` list, which is 'no'. When the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`, which is 'no'.
