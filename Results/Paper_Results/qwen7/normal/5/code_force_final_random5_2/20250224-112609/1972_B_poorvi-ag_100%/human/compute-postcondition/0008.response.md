Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing 'no', `arr` is the input string from the user. The count of 'U' in `arr` is even.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('no')` adds the string `'no'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
