Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
   - `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D"
   - `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even
   - `arr` is a new string input by the user
   - If the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd, `results` ends with 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` ends with 'no'.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - Since `t` is unchanged, it remains the same as the previous value, which is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` changes from 1 to 2.
   - `t` remains the same.
   - The other variables (`s`, `results`, and `arr`) are not part of the loop head and thus remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**
