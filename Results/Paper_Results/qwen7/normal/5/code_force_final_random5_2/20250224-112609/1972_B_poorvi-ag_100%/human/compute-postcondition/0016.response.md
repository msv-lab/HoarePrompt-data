Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, respectively, and `arr` is a new string input by the user. If the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd, `results` ends with 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` ends with 'no'.
