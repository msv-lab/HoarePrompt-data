Output State: `results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no', and every element of `results` has been printed exactly once.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. Since `results` contains 100 elements, the loop will execute 100 times, printing each element of the `results` list exactly once. After the loop completes, all 100 elements of `results` will have been printed, and the state of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `arr` will remain as they were initially, with `i` still being 99, `t` still being an input integer between 1 and 100, `n` still being an input integer, and `arr` still being the string input from the user for the last iteration.
