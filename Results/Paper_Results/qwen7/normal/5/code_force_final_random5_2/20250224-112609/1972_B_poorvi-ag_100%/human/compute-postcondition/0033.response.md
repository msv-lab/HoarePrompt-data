Output State: `results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no', and every element in `results` is assigned to `i` in sequence during each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list exactly once. Since there are 100 elements in `results`, the loop will execute 100 times. During each iteration, the current element of `results` is printed, and then it is assigned to the variable `i`. After all iterations, `i` will take on the value of the last element in the `results` list, which is the 100th element. However, the state of `results` itself remains unchanged; it still contains its original 100 elements, with each element being either 'yes' or 'no' based on the count of 'U' in the corresponding input string from the user.
