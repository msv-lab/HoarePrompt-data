You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is 99, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input from the user for the last iteration, `results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, respectively.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no', and every element in `results` is assigned to `i` in sequence during each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list exactly once. Since there are 100 elements in `results`, the loop will execute 100 times. During each iteration, the current element of `results` is printed, and then it is assigned to the variable `i`. After all iterations, `i` will take on the value of the last element in the `results` list, which is the 100th element. However, the state of `results` itself remains unchanged; it still contains its original 100 elements, with each element being either 'yes' or 'no' based on the count of 'U' in the corresponding input string from the user.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game as described. According to the problem description, the game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. However, the program simply checks if the number of 'U' (up-facing) coins is odd or even and decides the winner based on that. This approach does not account for the actual game mechanics, such as the removal of coins and the flipping of adjacent coins.

For example, consider the input:

```
3
5
UUDUD
5
UDDUD
2
UU
```

The program outputs:

```
YES
NO
NO
```

However, let's analyze the first test case "UUDUD":

1. Alice removes the first 'U', and the string becomes "DDUD".
2. Bob removes the next 'U', and the string becomes "DD".
3. Since there are no more 'U' coins, the game ends, and Bob wins.

The program incorrectly determines that Alice will win because the initial count of 'U' coins is odd. This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
