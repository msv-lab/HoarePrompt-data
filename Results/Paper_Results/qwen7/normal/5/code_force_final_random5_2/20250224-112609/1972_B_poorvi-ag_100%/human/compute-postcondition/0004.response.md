Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is an empty list, `arr` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `s`, and `results`) remain unchanged. The value of `arr` is the string input by the user.
