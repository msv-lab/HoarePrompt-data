You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is 99, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input from the user for the last iteration, `results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, respectively.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no', and every element in `results` is assigned to `i` in sequence during each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list exactly once. Since there are 100 elements in `results`, the loop will execute 100 times. During each iteration, the current element of `results` is printed, and then it is assigned to the variable `i`. After all iterations, `i` will take on the value of the last element in the `results` list, which is the 100th element. However, the state of `results` itself remains unchanged; it still contains its original 100 elements, with each element being either 'yes' or 'no' based on the count of 'U' in the corresponding input string from the user.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through some mechanism (t, n, s) where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
