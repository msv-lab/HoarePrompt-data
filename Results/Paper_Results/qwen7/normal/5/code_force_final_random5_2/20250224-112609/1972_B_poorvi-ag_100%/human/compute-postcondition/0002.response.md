Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = t-1`.

3. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".
   - `results` is an empty list.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop will start with `i = 0` and increment `i` until `i < t`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i` itself. Initially, `i` should be set to 0.
   - The values of `t`, `s`, and `results` do not directly affect the loop's execution condition, but they remain as part of the overall program state.

5. **Final State Before the Loop Starts**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `t` remains as an input integer between 1 and 100.
   - `s` remains a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".
   - `results` remains an empty list.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is an empty list**.
