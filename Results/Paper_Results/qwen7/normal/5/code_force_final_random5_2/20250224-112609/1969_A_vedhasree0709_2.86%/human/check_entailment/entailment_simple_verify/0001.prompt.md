You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

    #State: The loop will execute as many times as there are test cases (as specified by the first input). For each test case, `i` will eventually reach `n` because the loop continues to increment `i` until it does so. The variable `j` will remain 1 if the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met at any point during the loop's execution, otherwise it will remain 0. The list `l` will remain unchanged from its initial input state after each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend (given by `p_i`) receive an invitation.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` takes input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.
   - The code uses a while loop to check pairs of consecutive elements in the list `l`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The condition `if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:` checks if the current friend and the next friend form a pair where both are best friends with each other.
   - If such a pair is found, the function prints `2` and sets `j` to `1`, indicating that at least 2 friends will come.
   - If no such pair is found, the function prints `3`.

4. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The logic only checks for consecutive pairs and does not consider the possibility of forming cycles or other configurations.
   - The code does not handle cases where the best friend relationships form cycles or chains that require fewer than 3 invitations.
   - The code does not account for the fact that some friends might not be part of any pair or chain that requires only 2 invitations.

5. **Correct Solution Approach:**
   - To solve this correctly, we need to identify cycles and chains in the best friend relationships.
   - We should use a union-find data structure or a similar approach to group friends into connected components and determine the minimum number of invitations needed.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly solve the problem as it only checks for specific consecutive pairs and does not handle more complex scenarios. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
