Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0.**

The code initializes `j` to 0, which does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `l`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `j` is set to 0.
