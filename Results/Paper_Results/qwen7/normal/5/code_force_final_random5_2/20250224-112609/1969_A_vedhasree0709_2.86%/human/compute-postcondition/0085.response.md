Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `i` and `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers.

4. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i <= n - 1` must be true.
   - Given `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 3. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is already 3, it doesn't need adjustment.
   - The only state that needs adjustment is `n`, which must be greater than or equal to 4.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**.
