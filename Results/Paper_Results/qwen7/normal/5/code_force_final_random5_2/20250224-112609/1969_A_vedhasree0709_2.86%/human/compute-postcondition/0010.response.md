Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no loop or conditional block was specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, and `j` remain unchanged.
