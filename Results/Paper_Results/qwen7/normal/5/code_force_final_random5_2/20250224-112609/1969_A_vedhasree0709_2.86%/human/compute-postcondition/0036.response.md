Output State: **`i` is equal to `n + 1`, `j` is 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer, and `l` is updated to a list of integers from the input split and mapped.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
