Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list \( l \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index \( i \) such that \( l[i] = i + 2 \) and \( l[i + 1] = i + 1 \). If such an index is found, it prints 2 and stops further checks for that test case. If no such index is found after checking all possible indices, it prints 3. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
