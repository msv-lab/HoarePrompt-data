Postcondition: **All elements in the list are 0 or negative, with `list[i]` being 0 because `list[i - 1]` becomes 0 after 2 iterations, and `list[i + 1]` is now `list[i + 1] - 2 * list[i - 1]` (which simplifies to `list[i + 1]`), but since `list[i - 1]` is 0, there will be no further changes to `list[i + 1]`. The if condition is true as `list[i - 1]` is not 0.**
