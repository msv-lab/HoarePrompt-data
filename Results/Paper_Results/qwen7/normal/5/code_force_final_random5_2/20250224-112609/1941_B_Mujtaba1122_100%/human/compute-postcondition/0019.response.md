Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for Loop Termination:**
   - The loop terminates if `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1.
   - The loop also terminates if `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` is no longer greater than 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `list[i-1]` is 0.

3. **Determine the Current State:**
   - All elements in the list are 0 or negative.
   - The loop has terminated because either `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1, or `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` is no longer greater than 0.
   - Specifically, `list[i-1]` is 0.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop has already terminated, it cannot execute another iteration based on the given conditions.
   - Therefore, the state does not change for the next iteration as the loop is already done.

Given this analysis, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **All elements in the list are 0 or negative, and the loop has terminated because either `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1, or `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` is no longer greater than 0. Additionally, `list[i-1]` is 0.**
