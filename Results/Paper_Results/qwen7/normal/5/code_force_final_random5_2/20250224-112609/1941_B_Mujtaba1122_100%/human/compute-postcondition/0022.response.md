Output State: **`list[i]` is now 2, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i + 1]` remains greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` subtracts twice the value of `list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`. Given that `list[i - 1]` is 0, `2 * list[i - 1]` is also 0. Therefore, `list[i]` is reduced by 0, making `list[i]` remain as it was initially, but since it must be greater than 1, it is now 2 (assuming it was 2 before this operation to satisfy the initial condition). `list[i - 1]` remains 0, and `list[i + 1]` remains greater than 0 as no changes were made to it.
