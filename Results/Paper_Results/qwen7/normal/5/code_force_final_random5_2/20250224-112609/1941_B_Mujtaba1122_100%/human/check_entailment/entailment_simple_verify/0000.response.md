### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - The array is then passed to `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the array from index `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operations:
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - After performing the operations, it checks if `list[i-1]` is still non-zero. If so, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - If the loop completes without printing 'NO', it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Key Points to Evaluate:

1. **Operation Validity:**
   - The operations are only applied to valid indices (`2 <= i <= n-1`), which aligns with the problem description.
   - The operations are performed correctly according to the problem statement.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where an element becomes zero during the operations.
   - The program ensures that no invalid operations are performed (e.g., operations are not applied to zero elements).

3. **Final Check:**
   - The final check using `func_1` ensures that all elements are indeed zero before printing 'YES'.

### Conclusion:

The annotated code provides a clear and correct implementation of the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, and the final check ensures the correctness of the result.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
