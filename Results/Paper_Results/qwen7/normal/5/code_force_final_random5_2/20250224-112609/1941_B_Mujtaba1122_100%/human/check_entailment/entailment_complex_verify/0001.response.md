### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array `a` equal to zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (where `2 \le i \le n-1`) and performing the following assignments:
     - `a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1`

2. **Analyzing the Given Functions:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
     - It returns `False` if any element is non-zero, otherwise `True`.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function attempts to reduce the array elements to zero using the specified operation.
     - It iterates through the array from index `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
     - For each index `i`, it checks if the conditions allow the operation to be applied (`list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`).
     - If the conditions are met, it performs the operation and updates the array.
     - If at any point an index `i-1` is found to be non-zero after the operation, it prints 'NO' and returns.
     - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_2` seems to correctly implement the operation and check if the array can be made zero.
   - The operation involves reducing three elements: `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - The function ensures that the operation is only performed if the conditions are met, which prevents invalid operations.
   - After the loop, `func_1` is called to check if all elements are zero, ensuring the final state of the array.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - Let's verify the example provided:
     - For the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`:
       - Applying the operation at `i=4` results in `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=3` results in `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=2` results in `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=4` results in `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
       - The function correctly identifies that it is possible to make all elements zero.

5. **Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
   - The function `func_2` iterates through the array and applies the operation when conditions are met.
   - The function `func_1` is called to check if all elements are zero, ensuring the final state is correct.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases where elements might become negative, but since the problem guarantees valid inputs, this is not a concern.
   - The function correctly identifies impossible cases where an index `i-1` remains non-zero after the operation.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. The annotated code and the detailed analysis support the correctness of the implementation.

**Final: True**

The given program is correct.
