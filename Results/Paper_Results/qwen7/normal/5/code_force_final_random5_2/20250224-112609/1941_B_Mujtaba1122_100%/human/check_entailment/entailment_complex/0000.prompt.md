Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

# Annotated Functions:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers representing the array a, and n is the length of the array such that 3 <= n <= 2 \* 10^5.
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The function has iterated through all elements of the list `list`. The variable `i` is now equal to `n`, which is the length of the list. Since the loop did not return `False` during any iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, it means that every element in the list `list` was found to be 0. Therefore, the function did not return `False` and completed all its iterations without encountering any non-zero element.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and an integer representing the length of the list. It checks if all elements in the list are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns False immediately. If the function completes the iteration over the entire list without finding any non-zero elements, it returns True. The function can return either True or False based on the contents of the list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers representing the array a, and n is the length of the array such that 3 <= n <= 2 \* 10^5. Each element in the array is an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: All elements in the list are 0 or negative, with `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` all being 0. The loop terminates because none of the conditions inside the while loop are satisfied, as all relevant elements in the list have been reduced to 0 or below.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, every element in the list will be 0 or a negative number, but specifically, the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` will all be exactly 0.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: All elements in the list are 0 or negative, with `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` all being 0. The loop terminates because none of the conditions inside the while loop are satisfied, as all relevant elements in the list have been reduced to 0 or below. Additionally, the function `func_1(list, n)` returns the same boolean value in both cases (True if the if part is executed, and False if the else part is executed).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers by repeatedly modifying the values based on certain conditions until no further modifications can be made. Specifically, it checks each element (except the first and last) to see if it and its adjacent elements meet specific criteria. If so, it reduces the middle element and its neighbors accordingly. After processing, the function calls another function `func_1(list, n)` to determine whether to print 'YES' or 'NO'. The final state of the list is such that all elements are either 0 or negative, with the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all being exactly 0. The function does not return any value.
