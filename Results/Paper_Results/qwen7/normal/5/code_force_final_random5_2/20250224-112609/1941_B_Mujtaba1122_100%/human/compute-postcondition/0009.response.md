Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `list[1]` is now `list[1] - 1 - 2 * list[0] - 1`
  - `list[0]` is decreased by its current value
  - `list[2]` is greater than 0

- The `while` loop condition:
  ```
  while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop condition involves three variables: `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, all three conditions must be true:
     - `list[i] > 1`
     - `list[i - 1] > 0`
     - `list[i + 1] > 0`

3. **Analyze the Current State:**
   - From the given information, we know:
     - `list[1]` is now `list[1] - 1 - 2 * list[0] - 1`
     - `list[0]` has been decreased by its current value
     - `list[2]` is greater than 0

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `list[2]` is already greater than 0, no adjustment is needed for `list[2]`.
   - We need to ensure that `list[i] > 1` and `list[i - 1] > 0` hold true for the next iteration.

5. **Determine the Values of `i`:**
   - Since `list[1]` is involved in the expression, let's assume `i = 1` for simplicity.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure:
     - `list[1] > 1`
     - `list[0] > 0`
     - `list[2] > 0` (which is already true)

6. **Adjust `list[1]` and `list[0]`:**
   - `list[1]` is now `list[1] - 1 - 2 * list[0] - 1`.
   - To ensure `list[1] > 1`, we need `list[1] - 1 - 2 * list[0] - 1 > 1`.
   - Simplifying this, we get `list[1] - 2 * list[0] - 2 > 1` or `list[1] - 2 * list[0] > 3`.

7. **Adjust `list[0]`:**
   - `list[0]` has been decreased by its current value, so we need to ensure `list[0] > 0`.

### Final State Adjustment:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the values of `list[1]` and `list[0]` such that both conditions are met.

State: **`list[1]` must satisfy `list[1] - 2 * list[0] > 3` and `list[0] > 0`**
