Output State: **`list[i - 1]` is now `0`, and the conditions `list[i] > -1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 1` still hold for the rest of the list.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `1 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i - 1]`, which effectively sets `list[i - 1]` to `0`. Since the original condition required `list[i - 1] > 0`, after executing the code, `list[i - 1]` is no longer greater than 0, but the problem only specifies that the conditions must hold "such that," implying that the conditions should still be met for the rest of the list. The other conditions for `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` remain unchanged and still hold.
