Output State: **`list[i]` is now `-2 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, `list[i + 1]` is now `list[i + 1] - list[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The value of `list[i]` is updated to be `-2 * list[i - 1]`. The condition that `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `list[i + 1]` is not affected by the operation.
