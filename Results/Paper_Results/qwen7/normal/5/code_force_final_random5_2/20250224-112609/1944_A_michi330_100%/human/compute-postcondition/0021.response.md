Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^3, `i` is 3, `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `t` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. Therefore, `i` will be `t`. The values of `n` and `k` will be the inputs provided for the last iteration of the loop, as these values are read inside the loop and do not change across iterations.
