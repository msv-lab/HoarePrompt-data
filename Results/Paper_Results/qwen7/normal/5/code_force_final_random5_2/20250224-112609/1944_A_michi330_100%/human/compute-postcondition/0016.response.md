Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^3, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The variable `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their previous state. Therefore, `t` still must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^3\), `i` is now 2, `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, and `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer.
