Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers: t, n, and k, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2. It returns information based on the relationship between n, k, and the combination formula C(n, 2).**

This means the function indirectly accepts `t` test cases, each containing `n` and `k`, and returns information about whether `k` matches the number of combinations possible from `n` items taken 2 at a time.
