Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 2, `d[2]` is either 2 or `d[1] - 1` depending on whether the second character of `s` is "(", `d[3]` is `d[2] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1` updates the value of `d[3]` to be `d[2] - 1`. Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3. The value of `d[2]` is either 2 or `d[1] - 1`, depending on the second character of `s`. However, since the exact value of `d[2]` is not specified (it could be 2 or `d[1] - 1`), we keep it as `d[2]` and simply state that `d[3]` is `d[2] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
