Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `d[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether the first character of `s` is "(", `d[2]` is `d[1] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d[2]` to be `d[1] - 1`. Since `d[1]` is either 1 or -1, `d[2]` will be 0 if `d[1]` is 1, and -2 if `d[1]` is -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
