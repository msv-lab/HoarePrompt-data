Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t â€” the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

# Annotated Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is such that `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, and `d[n]` is the net balance of parentheses in the string `s`. This net balance is calculated as follows: starting from `d[0] = 0`, for each character in `s`, if it is "(", `d` is incremented by 1, and if it is ")", `d` is decremented by 1. Therefore, `d[n]` will be the difference between the number of "(" and ")" in the string `s`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `d[n]` will be the final value of the depth counter after processing all characters in `s`, indicating how unbalanced the parentheses are in the string. If `d[n]` is positive, there are more "(" than ")". If `d[n]` is negative, there are more ")" than "(". If `d[n]` is zero, the parentheses in `s` are balanced.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `d` is an empty list, `i` is -1, and `ans` is the concatenation of all characters from the string `s` as per the indices specified by the tuples in the original `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns an empty string since the list 'd' is empty and there are no indices to concatenate characters from the string 's'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(" and ")". It calculates the depth of each position in the string by maintaining a dictionary `d` where keys are positions and values are the net balance of parentheses up to that position. After processing, it removes the last entry from `d`, sorts the remaining entries based on their values and keys, and constructs a new string `ans` by concatenating characters from `s` according to the sorted indices. Finally, it returns an empty string because the list `d` is empty and there are no valid indices to concatenate characters from `s`.
