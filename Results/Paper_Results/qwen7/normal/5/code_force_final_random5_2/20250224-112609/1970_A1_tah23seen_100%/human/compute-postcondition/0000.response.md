Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and its length is not specified in the initial state but is known to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `n` now holds the exact number of characters in `s`. All other information about `s` remains unchanged.
