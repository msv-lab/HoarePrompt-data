Output State: **`a` must be at least 3; `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the value of `b[i]`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of `b[i]` from `b[i + 1]`. The condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement remains unchanged, and the postcondition for `a` also remains valid.
