Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, a - 2):
    if b[i] < 0:
        print('NO')
        break
    b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
    b[i + 2] -= b[i]
    b[i] -= b[i]
else:
    if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is an input integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where the second element is 0, and the third element is decreased by the first element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an integer greater than 2; `b` is a list of integers where the second element is 0, the third element is decreased by the first element, and the fourth element is the third element minus the second element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an integer greater than 3; `b` is a list of integers where the second element is 0, the third element is 0 (since it was originally the third element minus the first element, and then subtracted by itself), the fourth element is the original fourth element minus the second element, the fifth element is the original fifth element minus twice the first element, and the third element is updated to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
