Output State: **`b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, `i` is `i + 2`, and `a` must be greater than `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts `b[i]` from itself, effectively setting `b[i]` to 0. This changes the value of `b[i]` but does not affect the values of `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, or `i`. Additionally, the condition that `a` must be greater than `i + 2` remains unchanged. Since `i` was incremented by 1 before the current operation, it is now incremented by 1 again, making it `i + 2`.
