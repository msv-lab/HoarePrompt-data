Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `a` is an input integer decremented by 1. This means if the original input integer is `x`, then `a = x - 1`.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. This variable is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `a - 2`. Therefore, the loop can start executing if `a - 2` is at least 1 (i.e., `a` must be at least 3).

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `a` to be at least 3. The value of `i` is not specified initially, but it doesn't affect the loop's ability to start; it just needs to be within the valid range once the loop starts.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` being at least 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must be at least 3**
