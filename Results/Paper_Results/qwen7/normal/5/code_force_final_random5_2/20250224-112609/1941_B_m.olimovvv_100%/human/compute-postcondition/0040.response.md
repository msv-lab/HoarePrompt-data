Output State: **`a` must be at least 3; `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of `b[i]`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` decreases the value of `b[i + 2]` by the value of `b[i]`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `a` must still be at least 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
