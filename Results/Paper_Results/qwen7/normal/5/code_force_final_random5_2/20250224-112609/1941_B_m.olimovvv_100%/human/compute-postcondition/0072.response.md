Output State: **`b[i + 1]' is decreased by 2 times the value of `b[i]`; `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of `b[i]`; `b[i]` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts `b[i]` from itself, effectively setting `b[i]` to 0. The other conditions regarding `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
