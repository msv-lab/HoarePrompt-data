Output State: **`b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 0 * 2`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - 0`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts `b[i]` from itself, which results in `b[i]` being set to 0. The values of `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation.
