Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks if any element in the array is negative after performing the operations and immediately prints 'NO' if it finds a negative element. However, the problem description allows for multiple operations to be performed, and the program does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero through these operations.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

The program's logic would check the array [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] and perform the operations as follows:
1. Apply the operation at `i=1`: `[1-1, 3-2, 5-1, 5, 2]` → `[0, 1, 4, 5, 2]`
2. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 1-2, 4-1, 5, 2]` → `[0, -1, 3, 5, 2]`

At this point, the program would encounter a negative value (`-1`) and incorrectly print 'NO'.

However, the correct approach would involve ensuring that all elements can be reduced to zero through the allowed operations. The provided solution does not account for this and prematurely concludes that the array cannot be made zero due to the presence of a negative value after a single operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
