Output State: **`b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 0 * 2`, and `b[i + 2]` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` subtracts `b[i] * 2` from `b[i + 1]`. Given that `b[i]` is 0, the expression `b[i] * 2` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `b[i + 1]` remains unchanged. The values of `b[i + 2]` and `b[i]` remain as they were in the initial state.
