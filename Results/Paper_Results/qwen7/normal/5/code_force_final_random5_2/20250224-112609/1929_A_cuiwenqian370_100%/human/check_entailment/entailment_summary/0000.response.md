Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
- The `func_1` function calculates the beauty of an array by sorting the array and then summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach works because sorting allows us to maximize the positive differences while minimizing the negative ones.
- The `func_2` function correctly processes multiple test cases by reading input from standard input, splitting it into individual test cases, and calling `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.
- Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the functions seem to correctly implement the required logic. The `func_1` function sorts the array and sums the absolute differences, which is the correct approach to maximize the beauty. The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

Based on the above reasoning, the given program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
