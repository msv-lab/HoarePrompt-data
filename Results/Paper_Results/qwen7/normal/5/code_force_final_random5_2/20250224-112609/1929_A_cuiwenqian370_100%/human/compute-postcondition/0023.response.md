Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `index` is increased by 1; `array` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index` and of length `n`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list named `array` by mapping each element in the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` to an integer. The values of `t` and the updated `index` (increased by 1) are preserved, while a new variable `array` is introduced with its specific value derived from the slice of `data`.
