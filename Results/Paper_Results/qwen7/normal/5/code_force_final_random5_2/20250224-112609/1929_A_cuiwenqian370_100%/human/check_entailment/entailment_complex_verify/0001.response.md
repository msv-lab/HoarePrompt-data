### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight that sorting the array maximizes the beauty. Let's break down the program and verify each part:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: A list of integers `array`.
   - **Process**:
     - Sorts the array.
     - Computes the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Output**: The maximum beauty of the array.
   
   The sorting step ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest possible next elements, thereby maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones. This is the correct approach to maximize the beauty.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: Multiple test cases from standard input.
   - **Process**:
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, reads the size `n` and the array of `n` integers.
     - Calls `func_1` to compute the beauty for each test case.
     - Collects and prints the results.
   - **Output**: The maximum beauty for each test case.
   
   The function correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` appropriately. It handles the input and output as required.

3. **Verification with Examples**:
   - The examples provided in the original assessment are correctly handled by the program. The sorting and subsequent calculation of beauty are performed accurately.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like identical elements (e.g., `69 69 69`) correctly, resulting in a beauty of 0.
   - The program also handles small arrays and large arrays within the specified constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem by sorting the array and calculating the beauty as described. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
