Output State: **`t` must be 0, `index` is the sum of all `n` values encountered during the loop iterations, `result` is the last return value of `func_1(array)` computed during the loop, `results` is a list containing all the `result` values computed during each iteration of the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because it was decremented with each iteration until it reached 0. The `index` variable will have been incremented by the total number of elements processed (sum of all `n` values). Each `result` computed during the loop is appended to the `results` list, making `results` contain the outcomes of all iterations.
