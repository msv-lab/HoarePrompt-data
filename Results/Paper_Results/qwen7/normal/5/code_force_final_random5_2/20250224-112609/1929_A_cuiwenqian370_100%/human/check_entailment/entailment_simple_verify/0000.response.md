### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \( a \), defined as the sum of the values \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all integers \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
- The beauty is maximized when the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) are as large as possible.

#### Function Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - Sorts the array.
   - Computes the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - This approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty because sorting does not guarantee the largest possible differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads input from standard input.
   - Processes each test case.
   - Calls `func_1(array)` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Prints the results.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The original assessment states that the program does not correctly rearrange the array to maximize the beauty. This is true because simply sorting the array does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty.
- To achieve the maximum beauty, we need to strategically arrange the elements so that the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) are maximized. Sorting the array does not necessarily achieve this.

#### Example Verification:
Consider the input:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```

- **Original Program's Output**: 
  - Sorted array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Beauty: \( |54 - 43| + |80 - 54| + |90 - 80| + |100 - 90| = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57 \)

- **Optimal Arrangement**:
  - Optimal array: `[43, 100, 80, 90, 54]`
  - Beauty: \( |100 - 43| + |80 - 100| + |90 - 80| + |54 - 90| = 57 + 20 + 10 + 36 = 123 \)

The original program does not find the optimal arrangement, confirming the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly rearrange the array to maximize the beauty.

**Final: False**
