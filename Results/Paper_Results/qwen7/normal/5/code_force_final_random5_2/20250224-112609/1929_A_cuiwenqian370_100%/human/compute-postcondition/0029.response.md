Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for result in results:`.
   - The variables involved here are `result` and `results`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop iterates over each `result` in the `results` list.
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the provided information, the loop modifies the `index` and `t` variables.

3. **Determine the Initial States:**
   - `t` must be exactly 0 after the loop has executed.
   - `index` is incremented by the sum of all `n` values encountered during the loop iterations.
   - `result` is the last return value of `func_1(array)` computed during the loop.
   - `results` is a list containing all the `result` values computed during each iteration of the loop.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `results`, the initial state of `results` must be such that it contains the necessary `result` values.
   - The initial state of `t` must be set to a value that ensures it reaches 0 after the loop iterations.
   - The initial state of `index` must be set to a value that gets incremented by the sum of all `n` values.

Given these points, let's formulate the required states:

- `t` must be initialized to a value that ensures it reaches 0 after the loop. Since `t` is decremented in each iteration, it should start from a value that is the sum of all `n` values plus 1.
- `index` should start at 0 since it is incremented by the sum of all `n` values.
- `results` should be an empty list initially, as it will be populated during the loop iterations.
- `result` is the last return value of `func_1(array)` computed during the loop, so it should be initialized to the expected value or left as a placeholder if the exact value is not known.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`t` must be initialized to the sum of all `n` values plus 1, `index` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `result` is the last return value of `func_1(array)` computed during the loop**.
