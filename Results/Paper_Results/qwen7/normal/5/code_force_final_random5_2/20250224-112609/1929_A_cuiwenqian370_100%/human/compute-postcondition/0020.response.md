Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable directly involved in the loop condition is `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 0.
   - `index` is increased by `n + int(data[index]) + 1` and then further increased by `n`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`.
   - `results` list now contains `result`.
   - `n` is `int(data[index])`.
   - `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`.
   - `results` list has one more element which is `result`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop has executed at least once, `t` must be 1 (if it was 1 initially) or greater than 1 (if it was greater than 1 initially).
   - The other variables (`index`, `result`, `results`, `n`, and `array`) are not directly affected by the loop condition and are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
