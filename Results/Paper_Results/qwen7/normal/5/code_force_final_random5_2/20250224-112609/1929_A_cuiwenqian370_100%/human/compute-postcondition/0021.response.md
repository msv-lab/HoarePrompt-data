Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `n` is now an integer derived from `data[index]`.
