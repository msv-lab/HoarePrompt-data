Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `index` is increased by 1, `array` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index` and of length `n`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list named `array` by converting elements from the slice of `data` starting at `index` and of length `n` into integers. The values of `t` and `index` are updated according to their initial conditions, while `array` is newly created with the specified characteristics.
