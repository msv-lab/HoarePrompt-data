Output State: **`t` must be at least 0, `index` is increased by `n + int(data[index])`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the `result`, `n` is `int(data[index])`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` converted to an integer to the variable `n`. This affects the value of `index` by increasing it by `n` (which is now `int(data[index])`). All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
