Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between every pair of consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, leading to the maximum possible beauty since the beauty is defined as the sum of positive differences (or zero if the sequence is non-decreasing).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input reading and processing, ensuring that for each test case, the array is sorted and the beauty is calculated using `func_1`.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed out at the end.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The input handling and test case processing are also correctly implemented.
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the expected behavior of the program.

Given the above analysis, the program is correctly implemented according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
