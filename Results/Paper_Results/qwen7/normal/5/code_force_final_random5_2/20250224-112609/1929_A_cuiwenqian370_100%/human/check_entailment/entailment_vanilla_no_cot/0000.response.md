Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in how the `func_1` function calculates the beauty of the array. The goal is to maximize the beauty, which is defined as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. The current implementation calculates the absolute difference between adjacent elements, which minimizes the total difference rather than maximizing it.

To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array in descending order and then calculate the differences. This way, the largest values will contribute positively to the beauty, while smaller values will contribute negatively but with smaller magnitudes.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort(reverse=True)
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
    return beauty
```

With this correction, the program should now correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array.
