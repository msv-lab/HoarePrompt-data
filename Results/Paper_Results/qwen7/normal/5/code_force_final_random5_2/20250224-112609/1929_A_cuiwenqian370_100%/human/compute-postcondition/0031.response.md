Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `result` being iterated over from the `results` list.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` must be initialized to the sum of all `n` values plus 1.
   - `index` is 0.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `result` is the last return value of `func_1(array)` computed during the loop.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one element in the `results` list. The loop iterates over each element in `results`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `results` is currently an empty list, it means there are no elements left to iterate over. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again based on the current state.
   - However, if we assume the requirement is to prepare for the next possible iteration where `results` might contain elements, then we would need to ensure `results` contains at least one element.

Given the current state, the loop cannot proceed because `results` is empty. But if we were to prepare for the next possible iteration, we would need to ensure `results` contains at least one element.

Since the problem asks us to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, and given the current state, the only way to satisfy the condition is to ensure `results` contains at least one element.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next possible iteration would be:
- `t` must be initialized to the sum of all `n` values plus 1.
- `index` is 0.
- `results` must contain at least one element.
- `result` is the first element in `results`.

However, since the problem specifically asks for the state at the start of the next iteration based on the given information, and considering the current state is empty, the answer would reflect the need for `results` to have at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be initialized to the sum of all `n` values plus 1, `index` is 0, `results` must contain at least one element, `result` is the first element in `results`**
