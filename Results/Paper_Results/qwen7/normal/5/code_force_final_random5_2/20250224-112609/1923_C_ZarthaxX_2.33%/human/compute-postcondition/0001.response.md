Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `nums`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged.
