Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Conditions for a Good Array**: A subarray \( c_{l_i}, c_{l_i+1}, \dots, c_{r_i} \) is considered good if there exists another array \( b \) of the same length where:
   - The sums of elements in both arrays are equal.
   - No element in \( a \) is equal to the corresponding element in \( b \).
   - All elements in \( b \) are strictly positive.

2. **Current Implementation Issues**:
   - The code does not check if the sum of the subarray is even. If the sum is odd, it's impossible to find another array \( b \) with the same sum where all elements are positive and different from the original array.
   - The logic for determining if a subarray is good is flawed. The current implementation checks if \( 2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange} \), which doesn't guarantee the existence of a valid \( b \).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to check the following:
- Calculate the sum of the subarray.
- Check if the sum is even because the sum of elements in \( b \) must be the same as in \( a \).
- Verify if the subarray can be transformed into another array \( b \) where all elements are positive and different from the original subarray.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_good_subarray(nums, l, r):
    subarray_sum = sum(nums[l-1:r])
    if subarray_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    # Check if the subarray can be transformed into another array b
    # where all elements are positive and different from the original subarray
    unique_elements = set(nums[l-1:r])
    if len(unique_elements) < r - l + 1:
        return False
    return True

testCases = int(input())
for _ in range(testCases):
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    for _ in range(q):
        (l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        if is_good_subarray(nums, l, r):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the subarray meets the necessary conditions to be considered "good".
