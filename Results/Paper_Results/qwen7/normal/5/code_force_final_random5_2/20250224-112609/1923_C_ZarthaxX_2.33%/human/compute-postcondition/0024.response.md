Based on the initial state provided:

- `q` must be greater than 0 (though `q` itself is not relevant to the print statement).
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from input.
- `sumInRange` is the sum of integers from index `l-1` to `r`.
- `onesInRange` is the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]` if `l` is not equal to `r`. Otherwise, it is 0.
- The condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange) <= sumInRange` is satisfied.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
