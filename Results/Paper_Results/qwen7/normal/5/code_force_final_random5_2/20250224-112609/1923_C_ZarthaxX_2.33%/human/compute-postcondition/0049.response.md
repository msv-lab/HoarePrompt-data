Based on the initial state provided:

- `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`
- `q` is calculated as `q - 1`
- `l` and `r` are integers from input split by space
- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
