Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `ones` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list named `sum` with `n + 1` elements, each set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `nums`, or `ones`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new list `sum` is created and its state is specified as mentioned.
