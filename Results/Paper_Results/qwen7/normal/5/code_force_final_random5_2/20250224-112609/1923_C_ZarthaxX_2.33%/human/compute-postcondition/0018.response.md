Based on the initial state provided:

- `q` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `l` is an integer from input.
- `r` is an integer from input.
- The current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `r`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `l` and `r` since the print statement itself does not depend on these variables.

Output: **'NO'**
