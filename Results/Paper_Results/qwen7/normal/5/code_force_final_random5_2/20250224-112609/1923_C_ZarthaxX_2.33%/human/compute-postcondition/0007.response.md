Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `ones[i]` is updated to `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`
- `sum[i]` is updated to `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n`.

### Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `n + 1`.

### Adjusting States
- Since `i` is the only loop variable, we only need to update `i` to `n + 1`.
- The values of `ones` and `sum` arrays remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted and no further updates are made to these arrays within the loop.

### Final State
State: **`ones[i]` is updated to `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)` where `i` is `n + 1`, `sum[i]` is updated to `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` where `i` is `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`**

However, since the specific values of `ones` and `sum` at `i = n + 1` are not provided, we can simply state the change in the loop variable:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`**
