Output State: **`ones[i]` is `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`, `i` is `n + 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ones[i]` based on the value of `ones[i - 1]` and `nums[i - 1]`. Since `i` is initially `n + 2`, it remains unchanged. The value of `ones[i]` is set to the sum of `ones[i - 1]` and 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise it is just `ones[i - 1]`. All other variables and their states remain as they were in the initial state.
