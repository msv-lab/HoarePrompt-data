Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` at the start of the loop**: According to the given information, `i` is `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is within this range.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**: Since the loop starts from `1` and increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`.

5. **Adjust the other states based on the loop logic**: The states of `ones[i]` and `sum[i]` are defined in terms of the previous values and the value of `nums[i - 1]`. However, these states are not directly modified by the loop itself but rather by the loop body, which is omitted here. We only need to focus on adjusting the state of `i`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `i` is `n + 2`

Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head and their values are not directly modified by the loop itself, we do not need to adjust the states of `ones[i]` or `sum[i]`.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `n + 2`**
