Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 0, `l` and `r` are assigned the values from input split by space, we continue the loop or block of code we were inside.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `sumInRange`, and `onesInRange` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `l` and `r` variables are updated to the values provided by the user input, and the loop or block of code continues from where it left off.
