Output State: **`ones[i]` is `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`, `i` is `n + 1`, `sum[i]` is `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` array such that `sum[i]` is equal to `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`. The value of `ones[i]` remains unchanged from its previous definition, and `i` remains `n + 1`. Therefore, the updated state includes the new definition for `sum[i]` and retains the original definitions for `ones[i]` and the value of `i`.
