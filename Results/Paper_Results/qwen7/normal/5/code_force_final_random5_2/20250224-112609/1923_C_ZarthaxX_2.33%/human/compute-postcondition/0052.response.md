Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ones[i]` will contain the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list up to each index `i`, and `sum[i]` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to each index `i`, adjusted by subtracting 1 at each step. This means that `ones[n]` will give the total count of 1s in `nums`, and `sum[n]` will give the adjusted cumulative sum of the elements in `nums`.

In more detail, after the loop completes, for every index `i` from 0 to `n`:
- `ones[i]` will store the total number of 1s in the `nums` list from index 0 to index `i`.
- `sum[i]` will store the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` from index 0 to index `i`, with each element decremented by 1 before adding to the cumulative sum.

The values of `q`, `l`, and `r` will reflect the final state after all iterations of the loop have been executed, with `q` being decremented by 1 for each iteration where `l` is not equal to `r`. The conditions checked within the loop will be evaluated based on the updated values of `ones` and `sum` arrays.
