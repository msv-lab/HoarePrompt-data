Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer from input, `r` is an integer from input, and the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `r`. We continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `q`, `l`, `r`, or any other variables, their states remain unchanged. The only effect is that the loop continues.
