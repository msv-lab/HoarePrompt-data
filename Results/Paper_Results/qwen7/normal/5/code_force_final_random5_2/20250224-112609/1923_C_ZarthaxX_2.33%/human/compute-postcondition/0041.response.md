Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` and `r` are integers from input split by space, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))` takes two integers as input, splits them by space, and assigns them to `l` and `r`. The values of `onesInRange`, `q`, and `sumInRange` remain unchanged from their initial state.
