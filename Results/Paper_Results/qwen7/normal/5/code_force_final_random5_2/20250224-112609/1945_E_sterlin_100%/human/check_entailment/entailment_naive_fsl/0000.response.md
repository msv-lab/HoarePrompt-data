Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any logic to perform the required operations (swapping elements in the permutation) to make the binary search algorithm work correctly. The program only defines several input functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) but does not implement the logic to solve the problem described. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct as it fails to meet the requirements for every potential case.
