### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds the target value `x` at the `l`-th position when it ends.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is defined with the following steps:
   - Initialize `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
   - While `r - l > 1`, calculate `m = ⌊(r + l) / 2⌋`.
   - If `p_m <= x`, set `l = m`. Otherwise, set `r = m`.

3. **Goal**: We need to ensure that `p_l == x` after the binary search is executed. This means we need to place `x` in the position where the binary search would find it.

4. **Swapping Strategy**:
   - **Case 1**: If `x` is already in the permutation, no swaps are needed.
   - **Case 2**: If `x` is not in the permutation, we need to find the closest element to `x` and swap it with `x`. After the first swap, we might need to swap again to ensure `x` is in the correct position.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code does not implement the binary search algorithm or the swapping logic.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are utility functions for reading input, which are not used in the provided solution.
   - There is no logic to determine the necessary swaps or to perform the binary search.

6. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the provided code does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, it concluded that the program is incorrect.

7. **Re-evaluation**:
   - The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not implement the required functionality. The code does not read the input, perform the necessary swaps, or execute the binary search algorithm.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
