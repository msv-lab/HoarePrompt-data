Reasoning:
The provided solution uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to solve the problem. However, the problem requires finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts, and the provided functions do not address this requirement. Instead, `func_1` calculates the sum of the lengths of all blocks of '0's plus one for each block, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements. `func_2` calls `func_1` for each test case, further indicating that it does not correctly implement the solution.

Given that the provided functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
