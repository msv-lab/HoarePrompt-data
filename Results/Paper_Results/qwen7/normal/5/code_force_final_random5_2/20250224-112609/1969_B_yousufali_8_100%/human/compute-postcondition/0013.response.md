Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is an input binary string.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `ans` is 2.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for each index `i` in the range of the length of the string `s`.
   - The loop condition is `i < len(s)`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(s)`.
   - Since `i` is 2, `len(s)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(s)`.
   - We need to adjust these variables to reflect the next iteration of the loop.
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(s)` must still be greater than 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` becomes 3.
- `len(s)` must be greater than 2.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`s` is an input binary string, `n` is 1, `ans` is 2, `i` is 3, and `len(s)` must be greater than 2.**
