### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
- Each cyclic shift of a substring has a cost equal to the length of the substring.
- The goal is to minimize the total cost.

#### Provided Code:
- `func_1()` reads a binary string `s` and calculates a cost based on the positions of '1's and '0's.
- `func_2()` processes multiple test cases using `func_1()`.

#### Function Summary:
- `func_2()` processes a number of test cases and prints the result for each case. It does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.

#### Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` is flawed. It counts the number of zeros until the first '1' appears and adds that count plus one to the total cost. This approach does not account for the need to perform multiple cyclic shifts to sort the string.
   - For example, consider the string `101011`:
     - The first '1' is at index 0, and there are no zeros before it, so the cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - The next segment starts after the first '1', and there are two zeros followed by a '1', so the cost is `2 + 1 = 3`.
     - The next segment starts after the second '1', and there is one zero followed by a '1', so the cost is `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - The total cost is `2 + 3 + 2 = 7`, not 9 as required.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case, printing the results.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string. The logic in `func_1()` is incorrect and does not account for the need to perform multiple cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final:
**False**
