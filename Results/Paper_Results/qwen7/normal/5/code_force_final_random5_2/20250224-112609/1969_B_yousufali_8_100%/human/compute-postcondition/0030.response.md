Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the binary string `s` contains at least two consecutive '1's.**

Given that the function does not accept any parameters, the functionality is to check if the binary string `s` (which has a length of at least 2) contains at least two consecutive '1's and return a boolean value (`True` if it does, `False` otherwise).
