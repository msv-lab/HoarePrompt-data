Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.

In natural language: The value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases, must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute all its iterations. Since the loop runs as long as `t` is greater than 0, and no changes are made to `t` within the loop (based on the given information), `t` needs to stay greater than 0 throughout all iterations.
