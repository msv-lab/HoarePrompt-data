Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. 

Consider the input string `101011`. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would involve multiple cyclic shifts to sort the string. However, the current implementation does not account for this. Instead, it counts the number of zeros encountered until the first '1' appears and adds that count plus one to the total cost. This approach fails to consider the need for multiple cyclic shifts to achieve the desired sorted order.

For instance, for the string `101011`, the correct minimum cost would be 9, as shown in the example output. However, the provided function `func_1` would incorrectly calculate the cost as 4, which is not the minimum possible cost.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the string as a sequence of segments of '1's and '0's and calculate the cost based on the positions of these segments.
