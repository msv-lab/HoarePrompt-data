Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**: This function processes a single binary string `s` and calculates the sum of the lengths of all blocks of '0's plus one for each block. This calculation is based on the observation that to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts, we need to move all '1's to the beginning of the string. The cost of moving a block of '0's past a '1' is equal to the length of that block of '0's. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of all blocks of '0's plus one for each block gives the minimum total cost.

2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function processes multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. The function ensures that for each test case, the input is a binary string `s`. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, let's analyze the correctness:

- **Problem Description**: The goal is to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring shifted.
- **Function `func_1()`**: It correctly calculates the sum of the lengths of all blocks of '0's plus one for each block, which is the minimum total cost to sort the string.
- **Function `func_2()`**: It correctly processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case, ensuring that the input is a binary string and printing the result for each test case.

Since both functions together meet the requirements of the problem, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
