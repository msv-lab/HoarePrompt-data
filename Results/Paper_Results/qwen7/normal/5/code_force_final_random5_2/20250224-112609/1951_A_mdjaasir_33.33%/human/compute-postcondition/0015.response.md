Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement)
- `a` is a string entered by the user
- `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a` and it is equal to 2
- The index of the first '1' in `a` exists and the next character after the first '1' is not '1'

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Output: **YES**
