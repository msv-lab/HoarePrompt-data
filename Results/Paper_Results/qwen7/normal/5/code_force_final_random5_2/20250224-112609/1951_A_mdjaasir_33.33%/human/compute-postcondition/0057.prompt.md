Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a.index('1') and a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value entered by the user as a string, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If `count` is 0, then `count` remains unchanged. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, `count` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count` is not equal to 2, and if `count` is 2, the index of the first '1' in `a` exists and the next character after the first '1' is not '1', or `a` contains at least two consecutive '1's.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value entered by the user as a string, `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value entered by the user as a string, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. The postcondition remains the same as the precondition regardless of whether the condition `count == 0` is true or false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
