Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value entered by the user as a string, `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains unchanged from the precondition.**
