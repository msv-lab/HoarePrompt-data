Postcondition: `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value entered by the user as a string, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, and `count` is not equal to 2. If `count` is equal to 2, the index of the first '1' in `a` exists and the next character after the first '1' is not '1', or `a` contains at least two consecutive '1's. Otherwise, `count` is either less than or equal to 2 or `count` is odd.
