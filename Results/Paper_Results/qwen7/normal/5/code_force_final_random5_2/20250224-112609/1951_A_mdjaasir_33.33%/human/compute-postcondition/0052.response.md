Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value entered by the user as a string, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. The postcondition remains the same as the precondition regardless of whether the condition `a.index('1') and a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1'` is true or false.
