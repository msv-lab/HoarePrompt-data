Reasoning:
The given program aims to calculate the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The approach taken in the program is to sort the array and then sum the differences between corresponding elements from the start and the end of the sorted list up to the middle of the list. This method works because:

1. Sorting the array ensures that the largest possible differences are considered.
2. By pairing the smallest element with the largest, the next smallest with the next largest, and so on, we maximize the sum of differences.

Let's break down the steps:
- The program reads the number of test cases (`ntest`).
- For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`).
- It sorts the array `a`.
- It initializes `kq` to 0.
- It iterates over the first half of the sorted array, adding the difference between the corresponding elements from the start and the end of the sorted list to `kq`.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, this approach correctly maximizes the beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
