### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - For an array \( [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n] \), the beauty is calculated as \( (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases (`ntest`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`).
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It calculates the beauty by pairing the smallest and largest elements and summing their differences.
     - Specifically, it pairs `a[i]` with `a[n-i-1]` for `i` from `0` to `len(a)//2 - 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are paired together.
   - By pairing the smallest element with the largest, the next smallest with the next largest, etc., we ensure that the differences are maximized.
   - However, this approach only considers the differences between the smallest and largest elements, which might not always yield the maximum possible beauty.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the array `[1, 10, 100]`. The beauty calculated by the current approach is:
     \[
     (10 - 1) + (100 - 10) = 9 + 90 = 99
     \]
   - But the actual maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[1, 100, 10]`, resulting in:
     \[
     (100 - 1) + (10 - 100) = 99 + (-90) = 99
     \]
   - In this case, the current approach is correct. However, consider another array `[1, 2, 3]`. The beauty calculated by the current approach is:
     \[
     (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2
     \]
   - But the actual maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[1, 3, 2]`, resulting in:
     \[
     (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 2 + (-1) = 1
     \]
   - Here, the current approach underestimates the maximum beauty.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The current approach does not handle all edge cases correctly. For arrays with specific patterns, it may not yield the maximum possible beauty.

6. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement do not cover all possible edge cases, and the counterexamples show that the current approach is not always optimal.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not always correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. There are cases where the approach fails to find the maximum possible beauty.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
