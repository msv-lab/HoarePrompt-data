Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer t (number of test cases) followed by a list of n integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of differences between corresponding elements from the start and the end of the sorted list, up to the middle of the list. Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case.**
