Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
   ```
   This means that `itest` is the variable being iterated over, and the loop will run from `0` to `ntest - 1`.

2. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `itest`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `kq` is the sum of the differences calculated in all previous iterations.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `itest` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `itest` will be `previous_itest + 1`.

5. **Adjust the State**: Since only `itest` changes, we need to update its value. The value of `kq` remains unchanged until the current iteration is completed.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `itest` is `previous_itest + 1`.
- `kq` remains the same as the value from the previous iteration.

Since the exact value of `kq` is not provided, we can represent it as `kq` without specifying the exact sum, as it is the cumulative sum from all previous iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`kq` is the sum of the differences calculated in all previous iterations, `itest` is `previous_itest + 1`**.
