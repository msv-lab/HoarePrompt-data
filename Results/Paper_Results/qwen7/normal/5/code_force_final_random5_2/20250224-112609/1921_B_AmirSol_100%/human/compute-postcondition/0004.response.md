Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. `n` is a positive integer, and both `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It calculates and returns the maximum value between the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', and the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.**
