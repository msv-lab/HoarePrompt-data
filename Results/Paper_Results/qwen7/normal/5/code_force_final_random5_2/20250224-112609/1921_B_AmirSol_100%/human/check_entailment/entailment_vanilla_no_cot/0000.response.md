Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (represented by `s1`) to the desired state (represented by `s2`). The logic in the `func_1` function accurately computes the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`). The maximum of these two values gives the minimum number of operations needed because each operation (adding or removing a cat) counts as one day. The program iterates through each test case as specified and prints the result for each one.
