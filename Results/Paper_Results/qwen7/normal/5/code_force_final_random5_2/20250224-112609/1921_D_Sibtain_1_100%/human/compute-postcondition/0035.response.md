Output State: **`k` is 2, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`**

Explanation: The variable `t2` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. The values of `k` and `t1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
