Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `ans + 2 * max(t1, t2)`, `i` is either 1, 2, or 3, `j` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 3] - c[len(c) - 3])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t2` to `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. Given that `j` is 3, this simplifies to `abs(a[len(a) - 3] - c[len(c) - 3])`, which is the same as the previous value of `t2`. Therefore, the value of `t2` remains unchanged. All other variables (`k`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, `t1`, and `t2`) retain their previous values as per the initial state.
