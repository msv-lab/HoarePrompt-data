Output State: **`k` is 2, `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 100\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order (before the code) and then sorted in non-increasing order, `i` is either 1 or 0, `j` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[-1]` and `c[-1]`, `t2` is calculated as the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0 (since it was initially 1). All other variables remain unchanged.
