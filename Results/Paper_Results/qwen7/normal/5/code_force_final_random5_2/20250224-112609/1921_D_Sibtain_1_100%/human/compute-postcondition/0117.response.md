Output State: **`k` is 1, `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2)`, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. Since `t1` and `t2` are defined as the absolute differences between specific elements of arrays `a` and `c`, their values remain unchanged. The value of `k` remains 1 as there is no operation affecting it.
