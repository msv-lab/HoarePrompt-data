### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the given function summary step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \).
- The optimal strategy is to pair the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `c`, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Handling Uniform Arrays:**
   - If both `a` and `c` are uniform and match, the program correctly prints `0`.
   
2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - `c` is sorted in descending order.
   
3. **Calculating Differences:**
   - The program uses a loop to calculate the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c`.
   - It iterates through `a` and `c` using indices `i` and `j`, respectively, to pair elements and accumulate the differences.

#### Function Summary:
- The summary accurately describes the program's behavior, including handling uniform arrays and sorting the arrays before calculating the differences.

#### Optimal Strategy:
- The optimal strategy involves pairing the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `c`, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures the maximum possible difference for each pair.

#### Verification:
- The program's logic aligns with the optimal strategy described above.
- By sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order, the program ensures that the smallest and largest elements are paired first, then the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.
- This approach guarantees that the maximum possible difference is achieved for each pair.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the total difference \( D \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the optimal strategy to maximize the total difference \( D \) by sorting the arrays and pairing the smallest and largest elements accordingly.
