Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value that will be used as the range for the loop.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: The loop will execute based on the input value. Since the input is an integer, let's denote this input as `num_tests`. The loop will run `num_tests` times.

3. **Initial state before the loop**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). However, the loop's execution depends on the input value, not on `t`.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set the input value (`num_tests`) such that the loop can run. Given the constraints, `num_tests` should be a positive integer within a reasonable range (since the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), `num_tests` can be up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)).

Given these considerations, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect the necessary input value for the loop to execute.

**State:**
- `num_tests` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num_tests \leq 100\) (since `t` is given to be within this range).

Therefore, the final state is:
**State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num_tests \leq 100\)**.
