Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is equal to the length of the list `a`.
- `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration.
- `i` and `j` have been appropriately incremented, and the loop has completed all iterations.
- `c` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.

The print statement simply outputs the number `0`.

Output: **0**
