To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **k**: This is the length of the list `a`.
2. **ans**: This is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration. Here, `t1` and `t2` are defined as follows:
   - **t1**: The absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`.
   - **t2**: The absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`.

Given these definitions, `ans` is the cumulative sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for all valid indices `i` and `j`.

Since the actual lists `a` and `c` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each corresponding pair of elements from the two lists.

Therefore, the print statement will output the computed value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(t1, t2) for each iteration, with t1 being the absolute difference between a[i] and c[i], and t2 being the absolute difference between a[len(a) - j] and c[len(c) - j])**
