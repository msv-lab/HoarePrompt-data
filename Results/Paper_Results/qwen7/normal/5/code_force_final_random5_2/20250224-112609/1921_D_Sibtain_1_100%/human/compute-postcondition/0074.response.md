Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `i` is either 1, 2, or 3, `j` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 3] - c[len(c) - 3])`**.

Explanation: The line `ans += max(t1, t2)` adds the value of `max(t1, t2)` to `ans`. Since `t1` and `t2` are already defined, their values remain unchanged. The value of `k` and `i` also remain unchanged. The value of `j` remains 3. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans + max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)` (since `ans` was already `ans + max(t1, t2)` before this line).
