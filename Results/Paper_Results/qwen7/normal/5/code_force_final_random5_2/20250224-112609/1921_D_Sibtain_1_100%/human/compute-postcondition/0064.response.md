Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`, and `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 1, so now `i` is 2. The values of `k`, `ans`, `j`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
