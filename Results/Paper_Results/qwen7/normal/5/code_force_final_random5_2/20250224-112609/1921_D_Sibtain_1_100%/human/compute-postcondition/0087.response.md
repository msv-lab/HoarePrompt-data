Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from `k=len(a)-1` down to `k=1`, `i` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `j` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])` with `i` being the last updated index, `t2` is `abs(a[n - m] - c[m - 1])`, `n` and `m` are integers inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. It does not affect the values of `k`, `ans`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `t1`, or `t2`. The value of `k` remains 0, and the process of calculating `ans` and the values of `i`, `j`, `t1`, and `t2` based on the conditions of the loop will continue as before, with `t2` now being `abs(a[n - m] - c[m - 1])` since `k` starts from `len(a) - 1` and goes down to 1.
