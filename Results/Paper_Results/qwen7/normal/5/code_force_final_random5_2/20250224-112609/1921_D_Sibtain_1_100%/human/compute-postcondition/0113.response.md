Output State: **`k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j]))`, `j` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. All other variables (`k`, `t1`, `t2`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
