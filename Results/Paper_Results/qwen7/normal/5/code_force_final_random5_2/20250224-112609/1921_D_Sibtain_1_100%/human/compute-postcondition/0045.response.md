Output State: **`k` is equal to the length of the list `a`, `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` and `j` have been appropriately incremented, and the loop has completed all iterations, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them based on whitespace, converting them to integers and assigning them to `n` and `m`. The values of `k`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, and the conditions related to the loop remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `k` is still equal to the length of the list `a`, `ans` still contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` and `j` have been incremented, and the loop has completed all iterations. Additionally, `n` and `m` are now the integers input by the user.
