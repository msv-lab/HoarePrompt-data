Postcondition: `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j]))`, either `j` is increased by 1 if `t2 > t1`, or `i` is increased by 1 if `t2 <= t1`.
