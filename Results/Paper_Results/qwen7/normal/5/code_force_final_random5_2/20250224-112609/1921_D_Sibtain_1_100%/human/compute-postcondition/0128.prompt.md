Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. a_i and b_i are integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and a[0] == c[0]:
        print(0)
        continue
    a.sort()
    c.sort(reverse=True)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
        continue
    i, j, ans = 0, 1, 0
    for k in range(len(a)):
        t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
        t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
        if t2 > t1:
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        ans += max(t1, t2)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop has executed for all iterations, meaning `k` is equal to the length of the list `a`. The variable `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop. The values of `i` and `j` will be such that they have been incremented according to the conditions inside the loop until the end of the list `a` is reached. Specifically, `i` and `j` will be adjusted to ensure that the loop processes each element of `a` and `c` appropriately based on the comparison of `t1` and `t2`.

To summarize, `k` is now equal to `len(a)`, and `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, where `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, and `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, with `i` and `j` being updated according to the conditions in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `k` is `0`, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from `k=len(a)-1` down to `k=0`, `i` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `j` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])` with `i` being the last updated index, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - k] - c[len(c) - k])`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `k` will be `0` because the loop decrements `k` starting from `len(a) - 1` until it reaches `0`. The variable `ans` will contain the cumulative sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration. The values of `i` and `j` will be the final values they attain after the loop completes, and `t1` and `t2` will reflect the absolute differences based on these final values of `i` and `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: k is len(a), ans is the sum of max(t1, t2) for each iteration, t1 is the absolute difference between a[i] and c[i], t2 is the absolute difference between a[len(a) - j] and c[len(c) - j].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
