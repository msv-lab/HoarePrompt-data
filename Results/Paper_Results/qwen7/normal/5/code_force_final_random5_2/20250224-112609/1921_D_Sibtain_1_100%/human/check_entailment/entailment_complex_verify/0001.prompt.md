You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed for all its iterations, meaning `k` is equal to `0` (since the loop decrements `k` from `len(a) - 1` to `0`). The variable `ans` contains the total sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, where `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, and `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. The values of `i` and `j` are the final values they attain after processing all elements of `a` and `c` according to the conditions inside the loop. `t1` and `t2` reflect the absolute differences based on these final values of `i` and `j`.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations of the loop, `k` is `0`, `ans` is the total accumulated cost, and `i` and `j` are the final indices used to compute the differences.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers n and m, followed by lists a and c. If a and c are uniform and match, it prints 0. Otherwise, it sorts a in ascending order and c in descending order. Then, it calculates the total sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of a and c, considering specific conditions for indices i and j. Finally, it prints the total sum.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the sizes of arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If both arrays `a` and `b` contain identical elements, the program prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This handles the trivial case where no difference can be maximized.

3. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - Array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - Array `c` (which is the same as `b` but used for comparison) is sorted in descending order.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program initializes pointers `i` and `j` to traverse arrays `a` and `c` respectively.
   - It iterates through each element of `a` and calculates the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c`.
   - It keeps track of the maximum difference encountered and sums these differences to get the total difference `D`.

### Detailed Reasoning:

- **Sorting Arrays:**
  - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order ensures that the largest elements in `c` are matched with the smallest elements in `a` and vice versa, maximizing the differences.

- **Pointer Initialization:**
  - Pointers `i` and `j` start at the beginning and end of their respective arrays, ensuring that the largest and smallest elements are compared first.

- **Max Difference Calculation:**
  - The program calculates the maximum difference between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` and adds it to the total difference `ans`.

- **Handling Single Element Arrays:**
  - If `a` has only one element, the program directly computes the maximum difference between that element and the largest and smallest elements in `c`.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - `a = [6, 1, 2, 4]`
   - `c = [3, 5, 1, 7, 2, 3]`
   - After sorting, `a = [1, 2, 4, 6]` and `c = [7, 5, 3, 3, 2, 1]`
   - Maximum differences: `|1-7| + |2-5| + |4-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 13`

2. **Example 2:**
   - `a = [1, 1, 1]`
   - `c = [1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Both arrays are identical, so the difference is `0`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - `c = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Both arrays are identical, so the difference is `0`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference `D` by sorting and comparing the elements appropriately. The provided examples and the overall structure of the code support this conclusion.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
