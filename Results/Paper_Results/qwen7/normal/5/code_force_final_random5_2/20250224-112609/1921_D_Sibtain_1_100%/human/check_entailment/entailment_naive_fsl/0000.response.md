Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the arrays `a` and `c` contain elements such that the maximum difference cannot be achieved by simply sorting and pairing the smallest and largest elements. 

Consider the following input:
```
4 6
5 8 6 2
8 7 5 8 2 10
```

The program sorts `a` as `[2, 5, 6, 8]` and `c` as `[10, 8, 7, 5, 2]`. It then pairs the elements to maximize the differences. However, the optimal solution would be to pair the elements as follows to achieve the maximum difference:
- Pair `5` from `a` with `2` from `c`: Difference = `|5 - 2| = 3`
- Pair `8` from `a` with `10` from `c`: Difference = `|8 - 10| = 2`
- Pair `6` from `a` with `8` from `c`: Difference = `|6 - 8| = 2`
- Pair `2` from `a` with `7` from `c`: Difference = `|2 - 7| = 5`

Total difference = `3 + 2 + 2 + 5 = 12`.

However, the program's logic does not guarantee this optimal pairing. For instance, it might pair `5` with `10`, `8` with `2`, `6` with `8`, and `2` with `7`, resulting in a different and potentially suboptimal total difference. Therefore, the program does not always produce the maximum possible difference, making it incorrect.
