Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2)`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 4, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 3] - c[len(c) - 3])`.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
