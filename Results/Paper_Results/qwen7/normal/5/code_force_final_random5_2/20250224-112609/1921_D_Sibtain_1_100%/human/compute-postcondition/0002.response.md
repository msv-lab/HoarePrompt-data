Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num_tests \leq 100\); `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()).**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `a`. The values of `num_tests`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
