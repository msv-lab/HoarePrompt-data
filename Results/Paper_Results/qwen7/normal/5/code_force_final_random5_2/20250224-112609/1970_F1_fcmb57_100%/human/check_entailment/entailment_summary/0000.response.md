Reasoning:
1. The program correctly parses the initial state of the game, including the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
2. The program handles movements and actions of players accurately using the `func_1` function.
3. The program correctly updates the scores when a player scores a goal.
4. The program prints the correct messages when a goal is scored and the final score at the end of the game.
5. The logic for scoring and updating the score is correct, as it checks if a player's position matches a goal of the opposing team.

Given the provided execution summary and the analysis of the code, the program appears to follow the rules and logic specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
