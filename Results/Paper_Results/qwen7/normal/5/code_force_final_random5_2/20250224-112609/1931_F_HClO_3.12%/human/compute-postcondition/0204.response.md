Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - The sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`
   - Either:
     - `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1` with `p1` being 1, or
     - `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1` with `p1` being 1, or
     - `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, and `p2` is 1, and
     - Both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n - 2`.

3. **Conditions for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` would be 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 1.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - Since the loop head only involves `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that `n` remains greater than 1.
   - The conditions involving `p1`, `p2`, `l1`, `l2`, `a1`, `a2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now 1
   - `n` is still greater than 1 (unchanged)
   - The other conditions involving `p1`, `p2`, `l1`, `l2`, `a1`, `a2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1` with `p1` being 1, or `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1` with `p1` being 1, or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, and `p2` is 1, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**
