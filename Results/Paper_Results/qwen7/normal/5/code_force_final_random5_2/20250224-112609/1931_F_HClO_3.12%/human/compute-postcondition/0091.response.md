Output State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions, `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is -1, `val` is an empty list, `l2` is inserted with `a2` at index `idx1`.**

The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. Since `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on conditions, and `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is -1, and `val` is an empty list, these values remain unchanged. The only change is that `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the index `idx1`.
