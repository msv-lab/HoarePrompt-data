Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list containing all integers except the first one from the input excluding `a2`, `m` is `n`, `a3` is the last integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is an empty list, `val` is an empty list, `t` is 1, `a2` is the second integer from the input, `l2` is a list containing all integers except the first and second one from the input, `l22` is a list containing all integers from `l2` except `a1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l22` which contains all elements from `l2` except for `a1`. Since `l2` originally contained all integers except the first and second ones from the input, `l22` will contain all integers from `l2` except `a1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
