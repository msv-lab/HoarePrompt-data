Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` or `idx2` is set to `i`; `p2` is 1; both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative; `idx2` is now 2 if the if condition is not met. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified, the only effect is that the execution exits the current block. All the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
