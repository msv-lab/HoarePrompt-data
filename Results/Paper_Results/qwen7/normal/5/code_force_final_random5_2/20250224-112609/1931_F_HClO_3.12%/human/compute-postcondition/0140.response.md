Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers after the first two integers have been processed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `m`, `a3`, or `l3`. Instead, it indicates that the execution will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such context is provided in the initial state, the variables retain their original values, and the only effect is that the program breaks out of the implied loop or conditional structure.
