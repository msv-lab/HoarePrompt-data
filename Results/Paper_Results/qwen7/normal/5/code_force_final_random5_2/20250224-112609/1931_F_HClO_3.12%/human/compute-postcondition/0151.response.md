Output State: **`m` is `n`, `a3` is the last integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is an empty list, `val` is an empty list, and `t` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `input()` simply waits for user input, which does not modify any existing variables. Since no assignment or operation is performed on the variables, their values remain unchanged. The value of `m` is still `n`, `a3` remains the last integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` stays as an empty list, `val` becomes an empty list because `m-2` is 0, and `t` remains 1.
