Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` or `idx2` is set to `n-3`; `p2` is 1; both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative; the list `val` is created but is empty; `idx2` is `n-3`; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `m` equals 2; `a3` is the first element of the input split into integers, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split into integers; the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the index specified by `idx2`. Given the initial state, `idx2` is `n-3`, so `a1` is inserted into `l1` at the index `n-3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
