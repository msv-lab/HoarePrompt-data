Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `l11` is 0, `l22` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, `i` is either equal to `n - 1 - max(p1, p2)` (if the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is true) or `i` remains unchanged (if the condition is false)**.

Explanation: The variable `p2` is assigned the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states. The condition for `i` remains the same, as no new information about `i` was provided by the assignment of `p2`.
