Output State: **`m` is `n-2`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l1`, `l2`, `l22`, `l3`, `val`, `t`, `idx1`, and `idx2` retain their states from the last iteration of the loop, and `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `p1` and `p2` to 0. This does not affect the values of `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l1`, `l2`, `l22`, `l3`, `val`, `t`, `idx1`, and `idx2`. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 as they were in the last iteration of the loop.
