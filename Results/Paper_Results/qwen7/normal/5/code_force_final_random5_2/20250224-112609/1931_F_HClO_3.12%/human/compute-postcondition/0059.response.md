Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `a1` remains 0, `a2` remains 0, `l11` remains 0, `l22` remains 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code, the only effect is that we acknowledge breaking out of the implied context. All other variables retain their initial or unchanged states.
