Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` or `idx2` is set to `n-3`; `p2` is 1; both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative; the list `val` is created but is empty; `idx2` is `n-3`; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `m` equals 2; `a3` is the first element of the input split into integers, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
