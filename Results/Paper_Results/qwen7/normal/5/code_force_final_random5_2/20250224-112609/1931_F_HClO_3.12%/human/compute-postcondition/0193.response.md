Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, `idx2` is 0, `p2` is 1**

Explanation: The code `p2 = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `p2`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
