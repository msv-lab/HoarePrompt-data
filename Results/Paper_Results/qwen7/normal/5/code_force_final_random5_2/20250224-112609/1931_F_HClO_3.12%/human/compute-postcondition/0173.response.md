Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 (since `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n-2`).
   - The variable `n` is not explicitly given its value in the problem statement, but it is used to define the range of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, the condition `i < n - 1` implies that `n - 1` must be greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 2.

5. **Consider the other variables**:
   - The variables `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l1`, `l2`, `l22`, `l3`, `val`, `t`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `p1`, `p2` are not part of the loop head and their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
