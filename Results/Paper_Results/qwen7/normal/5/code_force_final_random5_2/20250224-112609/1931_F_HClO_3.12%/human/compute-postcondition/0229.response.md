Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and `idx1` is set to `i` or `idx2` is set to `i`; `p2` is 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative; `idx2` is now 2.**

Explanation: The code `idx2 = i` assigns the current value of `i`, which is 2, to `idx2`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
