Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and `idx1` is set to `n-3`; `p2` is 1; both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative; the list `val` contains one element which is `a1` at index `idx2`; `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` does not affect any of the variables or their values. It only assigns the name `l` to refer to whatever `l1` refers to, but since `l1` is not defined in the given context, it doesn't change any existing variables. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
