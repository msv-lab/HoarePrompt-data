Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list containing all integers except the first one from the input, `m` is `n`, `a3` is the last integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is an empty list, `val` is an empty list, `t` is 1, `a2` is the second integer from the input, and `l2` is a list containing all integers except the first and second one from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and unpacks them. The first integer is assigned to `a2`, and the rest are collected into the list `l2`. The initial values of `a1`, `l1`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, and `t` remain unchanged.
