Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `p1` is 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is set to `i` or remains unchanged, `p2` is 1, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `1` to `p1`. This changes the value of `p1` from its initial unspecified state (implied to be something other than 1) to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
