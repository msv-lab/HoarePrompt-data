Postcondition: `m` is greater than 1, `a3` is the next integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers after processing the first two integers. If `l3` is not equal to a list of the remaining integers after excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
