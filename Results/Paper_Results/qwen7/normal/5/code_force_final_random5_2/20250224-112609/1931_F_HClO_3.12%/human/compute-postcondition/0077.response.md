Output State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions, `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `i`.**

Explanation: The code `idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is `n - 2`) to `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
