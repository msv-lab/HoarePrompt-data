Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 2, input accepted but not stored.**

The `input()` function is called, which waits for user input but does not store or modify any existing variables. The precondition that `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 remains unchanged. The input from the user is accepted but not assigned to any variable, so no new variable values are introduced.
