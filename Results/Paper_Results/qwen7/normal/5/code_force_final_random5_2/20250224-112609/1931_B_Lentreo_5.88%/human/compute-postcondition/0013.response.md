Output State: **`curr` is `2 * (i - last)`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `last` is the last element of the list `nums`, `i` is the second element of the list `nums` (if `nums` still has elements), `nums` is the list without its first element.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to its current value. Given that `curr` was initially `i - last`, the new value of `curr` becomes `2 * (i - last)`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
