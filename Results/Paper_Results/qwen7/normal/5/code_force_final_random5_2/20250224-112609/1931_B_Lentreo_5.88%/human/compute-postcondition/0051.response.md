Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is simply `_` (an underscore), which is a common placeholder for an iterator variable when the specific variable name is not needed. However, the loop also references `t`, which is the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition given is that `curr` is the sum of all elements in `nums` except those that are 0, each adjusted by subtracting `last` from it, where `last` is the value of `curr` from the previous iteration. This condition holds true whether `curr` is 0 or not.

3. **Determine the Adjustments Needed**: Since the loop does not explicitly reference `curr` or `last` within its head, these values are not directly modified within the loop head. However, the loop itself is controlled by the variable `t`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

4. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1. The values of `curr` and `last` are derived from the loop body, but since they are not mentioned in the loop head, they remain unchanged for the purpose of adjusting the state for the next iteration.

Given the above reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`curr` is the sum of all elements in `nums` except those that are 0, each adjusted by subtracting `last` from it, where `last` is the value of `curr` from the previous iteration, `t` must be decreased by 1**.
