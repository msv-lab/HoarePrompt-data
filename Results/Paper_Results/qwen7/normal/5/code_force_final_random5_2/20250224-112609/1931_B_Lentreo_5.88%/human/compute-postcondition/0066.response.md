Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `nums`, and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `nums`.

3. **Determine the postconditions for the loop**:
   - `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`.
   - `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
   - `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - The first element of `nums` (`i`) is not 0.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `nums` must still have at least one element.
   - The first element of `nums` (`i`) is not 0.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `nums`, the next value of `i` will be the next element in the list `nums`.
   - `t` will be `t - 1` from the previous iteration.
   - `nums` must still have at least one element.
   - The first element of `nums` (`i`) must not be 0.

Given these points, let's adjust the state:

- `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`, but since we are looking at the state before the update, we keep `curr` as it was before the update.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `t` is `t - 1` from the previous iteration.
- `nums` must still have at least one element.
- The first element of `nums` (`i`) must not be 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`curr` is the same as before the update, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and the first element of `nums` (`i`) is not 0.**
