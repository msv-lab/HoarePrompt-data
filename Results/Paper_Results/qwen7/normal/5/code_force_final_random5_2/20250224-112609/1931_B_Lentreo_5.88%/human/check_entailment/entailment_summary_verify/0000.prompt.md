You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) (indicating the number of subsequent test cases) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers whose sum is divisible by \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of the non-zero elements in the list, adjusted by subtracting the last element of the list for each non-zero element. If this adjusted sum equals zero, it prints 'YES', indicating the sum is divisible by \( n \); otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of differences between each element and the last element is zero to determine if the containers can be made equal. This approach is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of redistributing water to achieve equality.

For example, consider the test case:
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
The program would calculate the differences as follows:
- Difference for 4: 4 - 3 = 1
- Difference for 5: 5 - 3 = 2
- Difference for 2: 2 - 3 = -1
- Difference for 1: 1 - 3 = -2
- Difference for 3: 3 - 3 = 0

Sum of differences: 1 + 2 - 1 - 2 + 0 = 0

Based on the program's logic, it would print "YES", but this is incorrect because we cannot redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount of water. The average amount of water per container is (4 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3) / 5 = 3, but we cannot achieve this distribution through the allowed operations.

A correct solution would involve checking if the sum of the elements is divisible by `n` and then verifying if the average can be achieved by redistributing the water. The program fails to handle this properly.
