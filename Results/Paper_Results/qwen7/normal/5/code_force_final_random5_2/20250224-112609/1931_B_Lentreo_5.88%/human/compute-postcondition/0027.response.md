Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `curr` is the sum of \((i - last)\) for each non-zero `i` in `nums`.
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `last` is the last element of the original `nums` list.
   - `nums` is an empty list after all iterations.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `t`, and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, we need to decrement `t` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`curr`, `n`, `last`, and `nums`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `curr` remains the same.
- `t` is decremented by 1 (i.e., `t - 1`).

So, the final state is:
State: **`curr` is the sum of \((i - last)\) for each non-zero `i` in `nums`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `last` is the last element of the original `nums` list, and `nums` is an empty list after all iterations. If `curr` is 0, no change is made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` retains its non-zero value.**
