Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the elements of the list `nums`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the elements of `nums`, the initial value of `i` should be the first element of `nums`.

3. **Determine the State of `nums`**: The list `nums` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider Other Variables**: The variables `curr`, `t`, `n`, and `last` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop's execution.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to the first element of `nums`.
- `nums` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the modified state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`curr` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string that must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of the list `nums`, `i` is the first element of `nums`**.
