Based on the initial state provided:

- `curr` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `curr` is also described as the sum of all elements in `nums` except those that are 0, each adjusted by subtracting `last` from it, where `last` is the value of `curr` from the previous iteration.

However, since `curr` is initially 0, there was no previous iteration to determine `last`. Therefore, the value of `curr` remains 0 throughout the process described.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
