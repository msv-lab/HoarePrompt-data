Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the current implementation is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The current solution calculates `curr` by iterating through the list and adding the difference between each element and the last element. This approach does not guarantee that the water can be evenly distributed among all containers. 

2. **Correct Approach**: To solve this problem, we need to check if the total amount of water can be evenly divided among all containers. If the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), then it is always possible to distribute the water equally among all containers using the allowed operations.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        if total_water % n == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
- It calculates the total amount of water.
- It checks if this total is divisible by `n`.
- If it is divisible, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
