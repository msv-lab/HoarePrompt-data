Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to a string, and then splits the string into a list of integers using the `map` function. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but a new variable `nums` is created and assigned the list of integers.
