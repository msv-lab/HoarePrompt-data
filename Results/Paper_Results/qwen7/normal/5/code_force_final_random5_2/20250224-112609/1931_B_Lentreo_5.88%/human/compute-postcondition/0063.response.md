Output State: **`curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`, `n` is an input integer, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `t` is `t - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and the first element of `nums` (`i`) is not 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` by adding the difference between the current element `i` and the last element `last` of the list `nums`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `nums`, and the condition about the first element of `nums`) remain unchanged.
