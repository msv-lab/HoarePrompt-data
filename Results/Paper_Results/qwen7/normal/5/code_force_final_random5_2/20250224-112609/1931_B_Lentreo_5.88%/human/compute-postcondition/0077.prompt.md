Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    last = nums[-1]
    curr = 0
    for i in nums:
        if i != 0:
            curr += i - last
    if curr == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `curr` is the sum of \((i - last)\) for each non-zero `i` in `nums`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `last` is the last element of the original `nums` list, and `nums` is an empty list after all iterations. If `curr` is 0, no change is made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` retains its non-zero value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `curr` is the sum of all elements in `nums` except those that are 0, each adjusted by subtracting `last` from it, where `last` is the value of `curr` from the previous iteration. This holds true whether `curr` is 0 or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `curr` is updated to either 0 or the sum of all non-zero elements starting from the second element of `nums`, depending on whether `curr` equals 0 or not. `n` remains an input integer, `t` is `t - len(nums)`, and `last` is the last element of the original `nums`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
