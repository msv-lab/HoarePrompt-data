Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 105, `s` is the string 'z', `j` is 202.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `j = 97` to `j = k + 96`, which means it runs from 97 to 201 (since `k` is 105). This is a total of 105 iterations. Each iteration appends the ASCII character corresponding to the current value of `j` to the string `s`. Starting with `j = 97` (which corresponds to 'a'), the loop will append characters up to `j = 201` (which corresponds to 'z'). After 105 iterations, the string `s` will contain 'z' repeated 105 times. However, since the loop appends each character individually, the final string `s` will be 'z'. The variable `j` will be incremented to 202 after the last iteration. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
