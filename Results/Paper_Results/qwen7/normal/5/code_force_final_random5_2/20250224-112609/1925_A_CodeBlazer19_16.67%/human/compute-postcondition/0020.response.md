Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` in the range from 97 to `k + 97`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The initial value of `j` is given as 106.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range [97, k + 97]. Given that `k` is 105, the range becomes [97, 202].

4. **Check if the initial value of `j` satisfies the loop condition**: Since `j` is initially 106, it falls within the range [97, 202], so the loop will execute at least once.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `j` is within the specified range for the loop to execute. Since `j` is initially 106, it already satisfies the condition, but we should still include it in the final state to reflect the initial setup.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted (or more accurately, reflected) are:

- `j` should be 106.
- `k` should be 105.
- The range of `j` should be [97, 202] to ensure the loop can execute.

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 105, `s` is an empty string, `j` is 106, and the range of `j` is [97, 202]**.
