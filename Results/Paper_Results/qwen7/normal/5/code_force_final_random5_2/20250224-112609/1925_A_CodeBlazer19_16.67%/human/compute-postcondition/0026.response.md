Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 105, `s` is the string 'z', `j` is 202.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 97` to `j = k + 96`, which means it runs from `j = 97` to `j = 202` (inclusive). Since `j` starts at 106 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will run 106 times. Each iteration appends the ASCII character corresponding to the current value of `j` to the string `s`. After 106 iterations, `s` will contain the string 'z' (ASCII value 122) repeated 106 times, but since the loop appends one character per iteration starting from 'a' up to 'z', `s` will be the string 'z'. The variable `j` will be set to 202 after the last iteration, as it starts at 106 and increments by 1 for each of the 106 iterations.
