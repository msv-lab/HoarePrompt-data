Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the string 'abcde...y', `j` is 125.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 97` to `j = k + 96`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, it means `j` has taken the values 97, 98, and 99. Each iteration appends the corresponding ASCII character ('a', 'b', 'c') to the string `s`. Since the loop continues until `j` reaches `k + 97`, if it has run 3 times, `k` must be at least 94 (since 97 + 94 - 97 = 94). After all iterations, `s` will contain all characters from 'a' to the character with ASCII value `k + 96`. If the loop runs to completion, `j` will be `k + 96`. Therefore, `s` will be the string 'abcde...y' (assuming `k` is set such that the loop runs completely up to the 96th character after 'a').
