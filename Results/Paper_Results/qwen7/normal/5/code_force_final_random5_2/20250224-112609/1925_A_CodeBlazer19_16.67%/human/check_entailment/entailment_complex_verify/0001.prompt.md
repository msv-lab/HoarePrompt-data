You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = ''
        
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 676, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer, `s` is the string containing all lowercase letters from the 97th to the \(k+96\)th ASCII character, and `j` is the next ASCII character after `k` + 96.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, it constructs a string `s` containing lowercase letters from 'a' to the letter corresponding to `k`. If `k` equals 1, it prints `n` times the string `s`. Otherwise, it prints `(2 - (n == 1))` times the string `s`. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating the String `s`:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `s`.
   - It then iterates over the range from 97 to `k + 97` (which corresponds to ASCII values of 'a' to the `k`-th character of the alphabet).
   - For each character in this range, it appends the corresponding character to `s`.

3. **Handling Special Cases:**
   - If `k == 1`, the program prints `n * s`. This means it repeats the single character `s` `n` times.
   - Otherwise, it prints `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`. This expression simplifies to:
     - `s` repeated twice if `n` is not 1.
     - `s` repeated once if `n` is 1.

### Testing the Program Against Examples

#### Example 1: \( n = 1 \), \( k = 2 \)
- `s` will be "ab".
- Since `k != 1`, the output should be `s` repeated twice: `"abab"`.

However, the expected output is `"ab"`. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle this case.

#### Example 2: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 1 \)
- `s` will be "a".
- Since `k == 1`, the output should be `n * s`: `"aa"`.

This matches the expected output.

#### Example 3: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 2 \)
- `s` will be "ab".
- Since `k != 1`, the output should be `s` repeated twice: `"abab"`.

This matches the expected output.

#### Example 4: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
- `s` will be "abc".
- Since `k != 1`, the output should be `s` repeated twice: `"abcabc"`.

This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

The program fails to produce the correct output for the case where \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 2 \). Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement.
