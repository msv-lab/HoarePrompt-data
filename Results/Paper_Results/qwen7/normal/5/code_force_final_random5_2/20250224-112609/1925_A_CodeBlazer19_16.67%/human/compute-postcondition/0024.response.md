Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(97, k + 97)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\)
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is the first integer input
   - `k` is 105
   - `s` is the string 'j'
   - `j` is 107

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `j` starting from 97 up to `k + 97` (which is 202). The loop will continue as long as `j` is within this range.

4. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since `j` was 107 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` will be 108.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: We need to check if `j` (now 108) is still within the range [97, 202]. Since 108 is within this range, the loop will continue.

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 105, `s` is the string 'j', `j` is 108**
