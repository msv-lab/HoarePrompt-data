Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3; `x` is the remainder of `a[i]` divided by 10; `y` is now `int(a[i] / 10)`, `n` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1` depending on the value of `i` and whether `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`; `c` is a list with an additional element `y` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `y` to the list `c`. Since `y` is already defined as `int(a[i] / 10)`, appending it to `c` increases the length of `c` by one. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
