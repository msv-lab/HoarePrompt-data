Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, k is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `k = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
