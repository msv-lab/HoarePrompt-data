### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:**
   - The `func_1` function is not being called with the correct parameters.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is flawed.
   - The program initializes an empty list `b` but does not append any values to it.
   - The program assumes `b` is populated with results from `func_1`, but since `func_1` is not called correctly, `b` remains empty.

2. **Analysis of the Annotated Code:**
   - The `func_1` function is correctly defined and processes each element of the input array.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it splits the number into its constituent digits and appends them to the list `c` in the correct order.
   - After processing all elements, the function sorts the list `c` and checks if it matches the original unsorted list `a`.
   - If the sorted list `c` matches the original list `a`, it means the array can be sorted by the given operations, and `b` is appended with `1`. Otherwise, `b` is appended with `0`.

3. **Key Points from the Annotated Code:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the splitting of numbers and sorting.
   - The variable `b` is used to store the result for each test case, indicating whether the array can be sorted.
   - The main loop in the program calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the appropriate result based on the value stored in `b`.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly processes each test case and determines whether the array can be sorted using the specified operations.
   - The logic inside `func_1` ensures that the array is processed correctly, and the results are stored in `b`.
   - The main loop correctly prints the results based on the values in `b`.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment was inaccurate because the program does correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issues identified in the original assessment were not present in the annotated code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
