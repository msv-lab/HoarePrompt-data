Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3; `x` is the remainder of `a[i]` divided by 10; `y` is now `int(a[i] / 10)`, `n` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1` depending on the value of `i` and whether `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`; `c` is a list with an additional element `x` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states. The list `c` gains an additional element which is `x`.
