Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `c` is a list containing all elements from the list `a` that meet the specified conditions, `n` is the length of `c`, `d` is a sorted version of `c`, and `b` now contains the element 1.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `b`. None of the other variables (`i`, `c`, `n`, `d`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
