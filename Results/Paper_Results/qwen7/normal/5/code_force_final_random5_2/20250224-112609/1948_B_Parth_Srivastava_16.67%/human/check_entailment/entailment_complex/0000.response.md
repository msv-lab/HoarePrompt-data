Reasoning:
1. The annotated program logic is mostly aligned with the problem statement. It processes each test case by splitting large numbers into their constituent digits and checking if the resulting list is sorted.
2. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
   - The function `func_1()` reads input twice for each test case, which is unnecessary since the input is already read in the main loop.
   - The variable `b` is initialized outside the loop but not reset for each test case, which could lead to incorrect results if multiple test cases are processed.
   - The function does not handle the case where the original array is already sorted correctly.
3. Despite these issues, the core logic of filtering and sorting the array based on the conditions is correct. The function should work as intended if these minor issues are addressed.

Given the core logic is correct and the issues are minor, the overall correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
