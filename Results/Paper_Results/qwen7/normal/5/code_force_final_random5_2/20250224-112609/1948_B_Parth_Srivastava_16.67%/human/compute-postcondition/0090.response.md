Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3; `x` is the remainder of `a[i]` divided by 10; `y` is `int(a[i] / 10)`, `n` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1` depending on the value of `i` and whether `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`; `c` is appended with `a[i]`; `n` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = n + 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `n` is dependent on its initial value (`n + 2` or `n + 1`) plus 1.
