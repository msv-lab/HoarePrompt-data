Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `c` is a list containing all elements from the list `a` that meet the specified conditions, `n` is the length of `c`, `d` is a sorted version of `c`, and `b` now contains the element `0`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `b`. None of the other variables (`i`, `c`, `n`, or `d`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
