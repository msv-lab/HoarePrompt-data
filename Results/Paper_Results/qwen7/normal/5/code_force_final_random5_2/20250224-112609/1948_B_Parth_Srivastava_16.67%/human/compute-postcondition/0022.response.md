Postcondition: `i` is greater than 0, `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`, `x` is the integer value of `a[i]` modulo 10, `y` is the integer value of `a[i]` divided by 10. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, then `c` is a list with two elements where the first element is `y` and the second element is `x`, and `n` is `n + 2`. Otherwise, `c` is a list with an additional element `a[i]` appended to it, and `n` is `n + 1`.
