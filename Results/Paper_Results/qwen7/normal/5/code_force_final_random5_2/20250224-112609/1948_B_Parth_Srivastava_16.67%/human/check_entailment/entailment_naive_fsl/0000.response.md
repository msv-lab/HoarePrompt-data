Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the array elements are split and reinserted in a way that maintains the non-decreasing order. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
3
3
10 1 11
```

The expected output should be "YES" because we can split `10` into `1` and `0`, and then the array becomes `[1, 0, 1, 11]`, which can be sorted to `[0, 1, 1, 11]`.

However, the program will output "NO" because it does not properly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits. The program checks if the resulting array after splitting is sorted but does not correctly manage the process of splitting and reinserting the digits to ensure the array can be sorted.
