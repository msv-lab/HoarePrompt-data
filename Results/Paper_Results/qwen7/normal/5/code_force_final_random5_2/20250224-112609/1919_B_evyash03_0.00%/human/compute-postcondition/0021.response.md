Output State: **`count` is either 1 or 2, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+", "-", `balance` is increased by 1.**

The code `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. The initial values of `count` and `expression` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `count` is either 1 or 2, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+", "-", and `balance` is increased by 1.
