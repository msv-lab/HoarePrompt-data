### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to understand why the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays to minimize the total penalty.
   - The penalty of a subarray is calculated as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program should find the optimal way to split the array `a` based on the input string `expression`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `expression` and the string itself.
   - It then splits the string `expression` based on the character `'-'`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the `expression` and the `result_length` (which is the total length of the parts after splitting).
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of times the balance (`balance`) is reset to 0 and adds 1 if the final balance is greater than 0.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function iterates through each character in the `expression`.
   - It maintains a `balance` variable to keep track of the cumulative sum of `+1` for `'+'` and `-1` for `'-'`.
   - If `balance` becomes negative, it increments the `count` and resets `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns the `count` plus 1 if the final `balance` is greater than 0.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     5
     -----
     ```
     - The string `expression` is `"-----"`.
     - The parts after splitting are `['-', '-', '-', '-', '-']`.
     - The function `func_1` will iterate through each character, and since `balance` starts at 0 and never changes (it only decreases by 1 for each `'-'`), it will be reset to 0 five times.
     - The final `balance` is 0, so the function returns `5` (number of resets).

5. **Optimal Splitting**:
   - The optimal way to split the array `a` for the input `"-----"` would be `[(-1, -1, -1, -1, -1)]`, resulting in a penalty of `5`.
   - However, the program incorrectly splits the string based on `'-'`, leading to a different and suboptimal result.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the total penalty.
   - The function `func_1` does not account for the optimal splitting strategy required by the problem.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
