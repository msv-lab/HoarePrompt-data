Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of times the balance (sum of '+' and '-') becomes negative and adding 1 if the final balance is positive. However, this approach does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The program does not actually calculate the penalty as defined in the problem statement. The penalty for a sequence is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program simply counts the number of segments where the balance becomes negative and adds 1 if the final balance is positive. This does not account for the actual penalty calculation.

2. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program splits the string into parts based on the '-' character but does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. For example, in the third test case (`--+++++++`), the optimal split would be `([2, 8])`, resulting in a penalty of 0, but the program incorrectly calculates the penalty as 2.

3. **Lack of Optimal Splitting**: The program does not implement any logic to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. Instead, it uses a simple heuristic which may not always yield the minimum penalty.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
