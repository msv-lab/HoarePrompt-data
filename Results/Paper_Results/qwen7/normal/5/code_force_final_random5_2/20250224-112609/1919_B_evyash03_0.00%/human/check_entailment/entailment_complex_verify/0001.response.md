### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: A string `s` of length `n` consisting of `+` and `-` characters.
2. **Array Construction**: Convert `s` into an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
3. **Penalty Calculation**: Split `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the sum of the lengths of these subarrays equals `n`. The penalty for each subarray `b_i` is `|sum(b_i)| * len(b_i)`. The total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.
4. **Objective**: Find the minimum possible penalty.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Logic**: The function iterates through the string `expression` and counts the number of times the balance (`balance`) is reset to 0 because it becomes negative. It also checks if the final balance is greater than 0 and adds 1 to the count if true.
   - **Balance Calculation**: The balance starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 for each `+` and decremented by 1 for each `-`.
   - **Counting Splits**: The function counts the number of times the balance is reset to 0 because it becomes negative. This count represents the number of splits needed to ensure no prefix of the array has a negative sum.
   - **Final Balance Check**: If the final balance is greater than 0, it adds 1 to the count.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the length of the string and the string itself.
   - It then splits the string at every `'-'` character, calculates the length of each part, and calls `func_1` with the string and the total length of the parts.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- **Splitting Logic**: The provided solution correctly identifies the number of splits needed to ensure no prefix of the array has a negative sum. This is crucial for minimizing the penalty because a negative prefix would increase the penalty.
- **Penalty Calculation**: The function `func_1` does not directly calculate the penalty but rather the number of splits required to avoid negative prefixes. This is a valid approach because the optimal way to minimize the penalty is to avoid creating subarrays with negative sums as much as possible.
- **Final Balance Check**: The check for the final balance being greater than 0 is unnecessary for the penalty calculation. The function should focus on counting the splits and not add an extra 1 to the count.

However, the original assessment is correct in stating that the function does not directly calculate the penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` returns the number of splits needed, which indirectly helps in minimizing the penalty but does not explicitly calculate the penalty.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not directly calculate the penalty as described in the problem statement, but it correctly identifies the number of splits needed to ensure no prefix of the array has a negative sum. This indirectly helps in minimizing the penalty.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
