Output State: **The final value of `count` will be the total number of times `balance` was reset to 0 because it became less than 0 during the iteration of the loop. The final value of `balance` will be the net result of adding 1 for each '+' and subtracting 1 for each '-' in the `expression` string.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `count` will be the total number of times the balance went below zero (resetting to zero), and `balance` will be the net balance calculated from the entire `expression`, which is the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string.
