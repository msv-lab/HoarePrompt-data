Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.
2. The given solution attempts to split the string `expression` at every '-' character and calculates the number of splits needed.
3. However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. It counts the number of splits needed to ensure that no prefix of the array has a negative sum, which is not the same as minimizing the total penalty.
4. The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that the penalty is simply the number of splits plus one if the final balance is positive. This does not account for the actual penalty calculation which involves the absolute value of the sum of each segment multiplied by its length.
5. The solution does not correctly implement the penalty calculation as described in the problem statement.

Given these points, the provided code does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
