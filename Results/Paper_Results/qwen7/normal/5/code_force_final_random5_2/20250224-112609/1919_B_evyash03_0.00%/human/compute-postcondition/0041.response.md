Output State: The final value of `count` will be the total number of times `balance` was reset to 0 because it became less than 0 during the iteration of the loop. The value of `balance` will be the net result of adding 1 for each '+' and subtracting 1 for each '-' in the `expression` string after all iterations have completed.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `count` will hold the total number of times the balance went below zero, which triggers a reset to zero and increments `count`. The variable `balance` will reflect the net difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the `expression` string.
