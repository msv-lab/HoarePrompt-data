Output State: **`count` is either 1 or 2, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+", "-", `balance` is decreased by 1.**

The code `balance -= 1` decreases the value of `balance` by 1. Since `balance` was previously updated based on the current character `char`, it now has its value reduced by 1. The other variables (`count` and `expression`) remain unchanged.
