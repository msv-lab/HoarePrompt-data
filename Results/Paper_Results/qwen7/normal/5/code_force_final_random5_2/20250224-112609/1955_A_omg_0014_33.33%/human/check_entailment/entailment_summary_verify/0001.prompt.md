You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers n, a, and b. It calculates either a * b or round(a * c/2) based on the comparison between a * b and a * c/2, where c is another integer input. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that iterates `n` times, reading three integers `(a, b, c)` for each test case.
   - Here, `a` is the price of one yogurt, `b` is the price for two yogurts, and `c` is used incorrectly (it should be `b`).

2. **Calculation:**
   - The variable `d` is assigned the value of `c / 2`, which should actually be `b / 2` since `b` is the price for two yogurts.
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d:` checks if buying one yogurt at the regular price is cheaper than buying one yogurt at half the price of two yogurts. This logic is incorrect because `d` should represent the price per yogurt when bought in pairs, not half the price of two yogurts.
   - If the condition is true, it prints `a * b`, which is the total cost if buying all yogurts at the regular price.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`, which is the total cost if buying all yogurts at the promotion price.

3. **Promotion Logic:**
   - The promotion logic should be based on the optimal way to use the promotion to minimize cost.
   - Buying in pairs can be more cost-effective, so we need to calculate the cost considering both the regular price and the promotion price.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly implement the solution, we need to:
- Calculate the cost if all yogurts are bought individually.
- Calculate the cost if we maximize the use of the promotion (buying as many pairs as possible).
- Compare these two costs and choose the minimum.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        # Cost if all yogurts are bought individually
        cost_individual = a * n
        # Number of pairs we can buy
        num_pairs = n // 2
        # Remaining yogurts after buying pairs
        remaining_yogurts = n % 2
        # Cost if we use the promotion for as many pairs as possible
        cost_promotion = num_pairs * c + remaining_yogurts * a
        # Print the minimum cost
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_promotion))
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors in its calculation and does not correctly implement the promotion logic. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
