Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, considering both the regular price and the promotional price.
2. The provided program defines a function `func()` that processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, where `c` is supposed to be `b`. However, `c` is not defined in the function, leading to an error. The correct calculation should be `d = b / 2`.
4. The program then compares `a * b` (regular price for `n` yogurts) with `a * d` (promotional price for half the number of yogurts). If the regular price is cheaper, it prints `a * b`; otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.
5. The logic in the program is flawed because:
   - The variable `c` is not defined, causing a NameError.
   - Even if `c` were correctly replaced with `b`, the logic does not account for the possibility of buying `n` yogurts optimally using the promotion, especially when `n` is odd.
6. To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotional price and how many individual yogurts will be needed at the regular price.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect due to the undefined variable and incomplete logic for handling the promotion optimally.

Correctness: **False**
