Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying \( n \) yogurts under the given promotion. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the average cost per yogurt for the promotion (`d = c / 2`) and does not account for the optimal way to group the yogurts to minimize the total cost.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 5 11
```
- The program calculates `d = 11 / 2 = 5.5`.
- It then compares `a * b` (which is `5 * 3 = 15`) with `a * d` (which is `5 * 5.5 = 27.5`), and prints `15`.

However, the correct approach would be to buy one yogurt at the regular price and the second yogurt at the promotion price, which would cost `5 + 11 = 16`. This is less than `15`, so the program is incorrect for this case.

To fix this, the program should calculate the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then handle the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
