Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.
   - `d` is equal to `c / 2`.
   - `a * b` is either less than `a * (c / 2)` or greater than or equal to `a * (c / 2)`.
   - `d` is now set to `c / 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(round(a * d))
   ```

Given the initial state, we need to determine the value of `round(a * d)`.

- `d` is explicitly defined as `c / 2`.
- Therefore, `a * d` is `a * (c / 2)`.

Since `a * b` is either less than `a * (c / 2)` or greater than or equal to `a * (c / 2)`, but we don't have specific values for `a` and `b`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a * (c / 2)`. However, we know that `a * d` will be the product of `a` and `c / 2`.

The `round` function will round this product to the nearest integer.

Thus, the output will be the rounded value of `a * (c / 2)`.

Output: **round(a * (c / 2))**
