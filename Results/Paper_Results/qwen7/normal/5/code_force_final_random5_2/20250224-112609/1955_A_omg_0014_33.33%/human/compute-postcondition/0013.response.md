Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, `d` is equal to `c / 2`, `a * b` is either less than `a * (c / 2)` or greater than or equal to `a * (c / 2)`**.

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `d` remain unchanged. Additionally, the condition regarding `a * b` being either less than `a * (c / 2)` or greater than or equal to `a * (c / 2)` is preserved.
