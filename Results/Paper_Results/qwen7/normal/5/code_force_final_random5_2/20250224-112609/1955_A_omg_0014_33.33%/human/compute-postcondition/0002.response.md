Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is not directly affected by this code. Therefore, `t` remains an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` remains 0, and `n` must still be greater than 0. The new variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values from the input split.
