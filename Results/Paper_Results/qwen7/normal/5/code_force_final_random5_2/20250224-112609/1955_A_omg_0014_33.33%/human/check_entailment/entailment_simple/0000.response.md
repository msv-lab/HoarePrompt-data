Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case.
3. The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which should be `b / 2` according to the problem statement.
4. The if-else condition checks whether buying individual yogurts at price `a` is cheaper than buying pairs at price `b`.
5. The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.
6. The final state after the loop completes ensures that all test cases have been processed.

However, there is a small mistake in the calculation of `d`. The variable `c` should represent `b`, the price for two yogurts, not some other variable. Therefore, the correct calculation should be `d = b / 2`.

Given this analysis, the program logic is mostly correct, but there is a minor error in the variable name used for the promotion price.

Correctness: **False**
