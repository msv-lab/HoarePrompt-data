Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, `d` is equal to `c / 2`, `a * b` is either less than `a * (c / 2)` or greater than or equal to `a * (c / 2)`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to new values from the input, `d` is recalculated as `c / 2`.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values replace the previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `d` is recalculated as `c / 2` based on the new value of `c`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged.
