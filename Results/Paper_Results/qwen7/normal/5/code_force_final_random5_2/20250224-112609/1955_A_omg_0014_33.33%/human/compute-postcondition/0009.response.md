Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.
- `d` is equal to `c / 2`.
- `a * b \geq a * d`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(round(a * d))`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `d` is calculated as `c / 2`. Since `c` is an integer, `d` will be either `c // 2` (integer division) or `c // 2 + 0.5` (if `c` is odd).
2. The expression `a * b` is compared with `a * d`. Given that `a * b \geq a * d`, it means that `b \geq d`.
3. We need to round the result of `a * d` to the nearest integer and print it.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a * d`. However, we know that `d` is half of `c`, and the result of `round(a * d)` will be the rounded value of `a * (c / 2)`.

Output: **round(a * (c / 2))**
