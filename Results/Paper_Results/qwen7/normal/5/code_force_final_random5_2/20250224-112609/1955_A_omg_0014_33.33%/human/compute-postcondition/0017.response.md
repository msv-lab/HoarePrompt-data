Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, `d` is equal to `c / 2`, `a * b` is either less than `a * (c / 2)` or greater than or equal to `a * (c / 2)`, `d` is now set to `c / 2`.**

This postcondition remains the same as both the if and else parts describe the same state of the variables after execution.
