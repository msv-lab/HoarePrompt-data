Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Calculation of Promotion Price**: The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which seems to be a typo. It should be `d = b / 2` since `b` represents the price for two yogurts.

3. **Comparison and Output**: The program compares `a * b` (price without promotion) with `a * d` (price with promotion). If `a * b` is cheaper, it prints `a * b`; otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`. This logic is correct for determining the minimum cost.

4. **Loop Completion**: The loop runs `n` times, ensuring that all test cases are processed. After the loop, the program exits, and no additional operations are performed.

Given these points, the program logic is correct for the given problem. However, there is a minor typo in the code where `c` is used instead of `b` to calculate `d`.

Correctness: **False**

The program would be correct if the line `d = c / 2` was changed to `d = b / 2`.
