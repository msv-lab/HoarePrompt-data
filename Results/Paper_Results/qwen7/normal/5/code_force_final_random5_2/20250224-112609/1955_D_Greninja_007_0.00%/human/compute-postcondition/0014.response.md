Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `good_subarrays` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_freq` and `matches` is decreased by the minimum of `window_freq[a[i]]` and `b_freq[a[i]]` and becomes greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains unchanged and `matches` is decreased by the minimum of `window_freq[a[i]]` and `b_freq[a[i]]`; `window_freq[a[i]]` is decreased by 1. The current value of `window_freq[a[i]]` is 0.**
