Output State: **`good_subarrays` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= n, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `good_subarrays` to 0. No other changes are made to the lists `a` and `b`, or the integers `k`, `m`, and `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
