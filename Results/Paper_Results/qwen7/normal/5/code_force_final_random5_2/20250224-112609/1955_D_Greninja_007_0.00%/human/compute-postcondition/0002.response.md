Output State: **`good_subarrays` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `b`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= n, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `window_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in the first `m` elements of `a`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new Counter object `window_freq` which counts the frequency of elements in the sublist `a[:m]` (the first `m` elements of list `a`). The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
