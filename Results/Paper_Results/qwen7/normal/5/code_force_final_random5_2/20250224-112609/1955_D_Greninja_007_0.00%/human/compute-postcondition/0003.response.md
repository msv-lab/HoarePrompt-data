Output State: **`good_subarrays` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `b`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= n, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `window_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in the first `m` elements of `a`; matches is the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `matches` by summing the minimum frequencies of elements present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`. This value is not stored back into any variable from the initial state, so the initial values of all variables remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `matches` with its defined value.
