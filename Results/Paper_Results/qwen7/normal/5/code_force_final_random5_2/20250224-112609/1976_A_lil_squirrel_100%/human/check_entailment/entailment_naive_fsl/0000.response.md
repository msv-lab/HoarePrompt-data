Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it handles each condition:

1. **Only lowercase Latin letters and digits**: The program checks the characters one by one and separates them into `letters` and `digits` lists. This ensures that only these types of characters are considered.

2. **Digits in non-decreasing order**: After collecting all digits, the program sorts them and compares the sorted list with the original list of digits. If they do not match, it returns "NO".

3. **Letters in non-decreasing order**: Similarly, after collecting all letters, the program sorts them and compares the sorted list with the original list of letters. If they do not match, it returns "NO".

4. **No digit after a letter**: The program iterates through the password and checks if a letter is followed by a digit. If such a sequence is found, it returns "NO".

Given the examples and the logic implemented, the program correctly identifies whether a password meets the specified criteria for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
