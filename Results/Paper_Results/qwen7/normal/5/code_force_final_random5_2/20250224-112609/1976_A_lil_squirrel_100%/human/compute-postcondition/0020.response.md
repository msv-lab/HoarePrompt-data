Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `password` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`.

In more detail, `digits` will include every digit found in `password`, and `letters` will include every lowercase letter found in `password`. Both lists will not contain any duplicate entries, as each character is appended to only one of the lists based on whether it is a digit or a letter.
