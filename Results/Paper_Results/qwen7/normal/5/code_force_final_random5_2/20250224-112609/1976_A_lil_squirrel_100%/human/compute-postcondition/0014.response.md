Postcondition: `password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the second character of `password`, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it was a digit, otherwise `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it was not a digit, and in both cases, either `digits` or `letters` will contain the second character of `password`.
