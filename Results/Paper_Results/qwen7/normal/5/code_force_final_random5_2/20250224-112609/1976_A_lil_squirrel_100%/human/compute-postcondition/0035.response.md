Output State: **The program returns 'NO'**

Given the conditions:
- `i` is 1
- `i` is less than `len(password) - 1`
- The character at index `i` in `password` is not alphabetic or the character at index `i + 1` in `password` is not a digit

The return statement directly returns the string `'NO'`. Since no other operations are performed and the return statement is executed, the program returns `'NO'`.
