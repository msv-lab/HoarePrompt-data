Postcondition: `password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the third character of `password`. If the third character `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first and third characters of `password`, and `letters` is an empty list. Otherwise, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it was a digit, and `letters` is a list containing the first and third characters of `password` if the first character was not a digit.
