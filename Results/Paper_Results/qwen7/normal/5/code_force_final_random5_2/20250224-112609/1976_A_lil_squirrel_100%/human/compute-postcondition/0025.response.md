Postcondition: `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20), `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the `password`. Every character in `password` has been processed, and based on whether each character is a digit or a letter, it has been appended to either the `digits` list or the `letters` list. The order of elements in both lists corresponds to their original order in the `password` string, and the `letters` list is sorted in ascending order.
