Postcondition: `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20), `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the `password`. The order of elements in both lists corresponds to their original order in the `password` string. The current value of `letters` is not equal to the sorted version of `letters`.
