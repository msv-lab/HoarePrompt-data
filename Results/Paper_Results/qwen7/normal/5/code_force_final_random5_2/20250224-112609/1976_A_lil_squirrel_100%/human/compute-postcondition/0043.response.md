Output State: The function does not return anything.

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop, if the loop did not encounter any situation where `password[i]` is an alphabet and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, it means the condition `if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit(): return 'NO'` was never met throughout the entire loop execution. Therefore, the function will not return anything and will continue to its next line of code, which in this case is simply ending without returning any value.
