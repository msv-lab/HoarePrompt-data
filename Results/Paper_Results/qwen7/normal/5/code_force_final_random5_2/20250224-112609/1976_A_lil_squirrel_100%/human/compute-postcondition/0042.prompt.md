Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20), `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the `password`. The letters in `letters` list are in sorted order, and the `digits` list is sorted.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(password) - 1):
    if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `i` is less than `len(password) - 1`. The character at index `i` in `password` is not alphabetic or the character at index `i + 1` in `password` is not a digit

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is an integer where `i` is 1 and less than `len(password) - 1`. If the character at index `i` in `password` is alphabetic and the character at index `i + 1` is a digit, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function returns nothing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is an integer and is less than `len(password) - 1`. If `password[i]` is an alphabet and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
