### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Function Call**:
   - For each test case, the program calls `func_1(s)` and prints the result, then decrements `t` until all test cases are processed. This part is also correct.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - The function initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0. This is correct.
   - **Loop through String**:
     - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
       - If the character is '1', it increments the count of '1's (`one`). This is correct.
       - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' encountered (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`. This logic is intended to account for the cost of cyclic shifts needed to move '1's to the end of the string. However, this logic is flawed.
   - **Cost Calculation**:
     - The logic for calculating the cost is incorrect. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string. Instead, it simply counts the number of '1's following a '0' and adds one to the cost. This does not accurately reflect the minimum cost required to sort the string using cyclic shifts.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The provided examples cover various scenarios, but the function does not handle them correctly. For instance, consider the string "101011". The function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 9, whereas the correct cost is 5.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Incorrect Logic**:
  - The current logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. For example, in the string "101011", the function would add `one + 1` for each '0' followed by at least one '1'. This results in:
    - First '0': `one = 1`, `cost += 1 + 1 = 2`
    - Second '0': `one = 2`, `cost += 2 + 1 = 5`
    - Third '0': `one = 3`, `cost += 3 + 1 = 9`
  - This approach does not account for the fact that we can perform multiple cyclic shifts to minimize the cost. For instance, we can shift the substring "101011" to "010111" with a cost of 3, and then shift "010111" to "001111" with a cost of 2, resulting in a total cost of 5.

- **Correct Approach**:
  - To find the minimum cost, we need to identify the longest contiguous segment of '1's and then calculate the cost of moving all '0's to the beginning of the string. This involves identifying the position of the first '0' and the position of the last '1', and then calculating the cost based on the distance between these positions.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string. The provided logic does not simulate the actual process of cyclic shifts and thus does not yield the correct result.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
