Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `s` will be an empty string, `one` will be equal to the total number of '1's in the original string `s`, and `cost` will be equal to the sum of `(number of '1's + 1)` for every occurrence where a '0' is followed by at least one '1'.**

Explanation:
- The variable `s` is progressively sliced from left to right as the loop iterates through each character.
- Each time a '1' is encountered, `one` is incremented.
- Each time a '0' is encountered and there are one or more '1's already counted (`one > 0`), `cost` is incremented by `one + 1`.
- Once the loop completes, `s` becomes an empty string since it has been fully processed.
- `one` holds the total count of '1's in the original string `s`.
- `cost` accumulates the sum of `(number of '1's + 1)` for every '0' that was followed by at least one '1'.
