### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function `func_1` calculates a cost based on the positions of '1's and '0's in the string. Specifically, for each '0' that is followed by at least one '1', it adds the count of '1's following that '0' plus one to the cost. This summary is misleading because it does not reflect the actual logic used in the function. Let's break down the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost
```

- The variable `one` counts the number of consecutive '1's encountered.
- When a '0' is encountered and there have been at least one '1' before it (`one > 0`), the cost is incremented by `one + 1`.

This logic is not directly related to the optimal cyclic shifts required to sort the string. Instead, it seems to be calculating a cost based on the positions of '1's and '0's, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to find the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to sort the string. Each '0' that needs to be moved to the front of the string will require a shift equal to its position from the end of the string. We need to count the number of '1's between each pair of '0's and '1's to determine the cost.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the string "101011":
- The first '0' is at position 1 and has 3 '1's after it: cost = 3 + 1 = 4.
- The second '0' is at position 4 and has 2 '1's after it: cost = 2 + 1 = 3.
- The third '0' is at position 6 and has 1 '1' after it: cost = 1 + 1 = 2.

Total cost = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9.

This matches the expected output for the given test case.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order through cyclic shifts. The function summary is misleading and does not reflect the actual logic used in the function.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
