Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty binary string starting from the second character, `i` is the second character of the original `s`, and `cost` is increased by 1 plus the value of `one`, provided that the second character of `s` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0. If the second character of `s` is not '0', no changes are made to `cost`.
