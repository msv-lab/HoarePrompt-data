### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function Call**:
   - For each test case, the program calls `func_1(s)` and prints the result, then decrements `t` until all test cases are processed. This part is also handled correctly.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - The function initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0. This is correct.
   - **Loop through String**:
     - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
       - If the character is '1', it increments the count of '1's (`one`). This is correct.
       - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' encountered (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`. This logic is intended to account for the cost of cyclic shifts needed to move '1's to the end of the string. However, this logic has a flaw.
   - **Cost Calculation**:
     - The logic for calculating the cost is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that every '0' followed by at least one '1' requires a shift of `one + 1` positions. This is not always true.
     - For example, consider the string "101011". The function would calculate the cost as follows:
       - First '1': `one = 1`
       - '0': `cost += 1 + 1 = 2`
       - Second '1': `one = 2`
       - '0': `cost += 2 + 1 = 4`
       - Third '1': `one = 3`
       - '1': `one = 4`
       - '1': `one = 5`
       - Total cost: `2 + 4 + 5 = 11`
     - However, the optimal solution involves fewer shifts. One possible optimal sequence of shifts is:
       - Choose substring [1, 3]: "101011" -> "010111"
       - Choose substring [2, 4]: "010111" -> "001111"
       - Total cost: `3 + 3 = 6`
     - The current implementation does not account for the optimal sequence of shifts, leading to an incorrect cost calculation.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided examples cover various scenarios, including strings that are already sorted, strings with all '0's, and mixed strings. However, the function does not handle these cases optimally due to the flawed logic.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order. The logic for calculating the cost is flawed and does not account for the optimal sequence of cyclic shifts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
