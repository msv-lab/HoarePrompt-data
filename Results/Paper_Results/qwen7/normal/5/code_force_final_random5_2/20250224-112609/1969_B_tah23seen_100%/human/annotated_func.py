#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000.
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` will be an empty string, `one` will be equal to the total number of '1's in the original string `s`, and `cost` will be equal to the sum of `(number of '1's + 1)` for every occurrence where a '0' is followed by at least one '1'.
    return cost
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string `s` and calculates a cost based on the positions of '1's and '0's in the string. Specifically, for each '0' that is followed by at least one '1', it adds the count of '1's following that '0' plus one to the cost. Finally, it returns the total cost, which is guaranteed to be 0 according to the return postconditions.
