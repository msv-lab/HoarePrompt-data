Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000; `cost` is 0; `one` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '1':
        one += 1
    elif i == '0' and one > 0:
        cost += one + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty binary string, if the first character `i` is '1', then `one` is set to 2. If the first character `i` is '0', then `cost` is increased by the number of '1's in the string `s` plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty binary string starting from the second character, `i` is the second character of the original `s`, and `cost` is increased by 1 plus the value of `one` if the second character `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0. If the second character `i` is '1' or the condition `i == '0' and one > 0` is not met, the values of `s`, `i`, and `cost` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty binary string starting from the second character, `i` is the next character in the original `s`, `cost` is increased by 1 plus the value of `one` if the next character `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, and `one` is increased by 1 if the next character `i` is '1'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
