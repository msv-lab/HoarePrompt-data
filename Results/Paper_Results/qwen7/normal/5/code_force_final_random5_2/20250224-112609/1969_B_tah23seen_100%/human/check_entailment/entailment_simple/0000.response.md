### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by calling `func_1(s)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `cost` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is '1', it increments the counter `one`.
   - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' encountered (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The logic for calculating the cost is correct. For each '0' that is not the start of the string and is followed by at least one '1', the cost is incremented by the number of '1's seen plus one. This accounts for the minimum number of operations needed to move all '1's to the end of the string.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns the calculated `cost` after processing the entire string.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string consists entirely of '0's, the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the string consists entirely of '1's, the function also correctly returns 0.
   - If the string has a mix of '0's and '1's, the function calculates the cost correctly.

6. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the function.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the defined operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
