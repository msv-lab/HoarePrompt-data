Output State: **`s` is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000; `cost` is 0; `one` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `one` is assigned the value 0. This does not affect the values of `s` or `cost`. Therefore, the initial values of `s` and `cost` remain unchanged, and `one` is now explicitly set to 0.
