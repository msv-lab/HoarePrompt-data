Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`, which is used in the `for` loop to iterate over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is being used to iterate through the string `s`, it should start from the first character of the string. Therefore, `i` should be set to the first character of `s`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `s`**: The string `s` is a binary string, and since it is being iterated over, it should be a non-empty string.

4. **Other Variables**: The variables `cost` and `one` are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be set to the first character of `s`.
- `s` should be a non-empty binary string.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the first character of `s`**.
