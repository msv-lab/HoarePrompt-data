Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` (the current character being processed) and `s` (the binary string).

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty binary string.
   - If the first character `i` is '1', then `one` is set to 2.
   - If the first character `i` is '0', then `cost` is increased by the number of '1's in the string `s` plus 1.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop processes one character at a time, after the previous iteration, `i` would be the first character of `s`.
   - For the loop to continue, `s` must still contain at least one character.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be the second character of `s` (since it was the first character in the previous iteration).
   - `s` will be the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `s` is now the substring of the original `s` starting from the second character.
- `i` is the second character of the original `s`.

Since the postcondition does not specify the value of `one` or `cost` changing unless the first character is '1' or '0', and since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, the values of `one` and `cost` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string starting from the second character, `i` is the second character of the original `s`**.
