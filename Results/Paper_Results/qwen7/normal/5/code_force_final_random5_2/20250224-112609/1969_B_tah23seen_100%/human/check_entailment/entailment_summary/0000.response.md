Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. However, the logic implemented in the `func_1` function does not correctly simulate the process of making the string sorted through cyclic shifts. Instead, it calculates a cost based on the positions of '1's and '0's in the string, which does not accurately reflect the cost of the required operations.

To correctly solve the problem, we should identify segments of consecutive '1's and '0's and calculate the cost based on the number of cyclic shifts needed to move all '1's to the end of the string. The provided function does not achieve this goal.

Given the execution summary mentions that the function is guaranteed to return 0 according to the return postconditions, this indicates that the function does not correctly implement the solution. Therefore, the program as provided is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
