Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `s` and calculates a cost based on the positions of '1's and '0's in the string. Specifically, for each '0' that is followed by at least one '1', it adds the count of '1's following that '0' plus one to the cost. Finally, it returns the total cost, which is guaranteed to be 0 according to the return postconditions.**
