You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a binary string `s` and calculates a cost based on the positions of '1's and '0's in the string. Specifically, for each '0' that is followed by at least one '1', it adds the count of '1's following that '0' plus one to the cost. Finally, it returns the total cost, which is guaranteed to be 0 according to the return postconditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function Call**: For each test case, the program calls `func_1(s)` and prints the result, then decrements `t` until all test cases are processed.
3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - **Loop through String**: It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments the count of '1's (`one`).
     - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' encountered (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`. This logic is intended to account for the cost of cyclic shifts needed to move '1's to the end of the string.
4. **Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost seems correct. By adding `one + 1` whenever a '0' is encountered after at least one '1', it effectively counts the number of shifts required to move all '1's to the end of the string.
5. **Edge Cases**: The provided examples cover various scenarios, including strings that are already sorted, strings with all '0's, and mixed strings. The function handles these cases correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description.
