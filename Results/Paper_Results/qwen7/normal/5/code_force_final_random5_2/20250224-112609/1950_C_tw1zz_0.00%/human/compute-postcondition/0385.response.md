Based on the initial state provided:

- `h1` is one of the strings '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '01'.
- `m1` is the same as `m`.
- `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '12' or '09', otherwise it is 'PM'.
- `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input.
- `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input.
- `num_iterations` is not directly used in the print statement but is mentioned as the context for the remaining iterations.

The print statement is:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

Given the variables:
- `h1` is one of the specified strings.
- `m` is an input string.
- `time` is determined by the value of `h`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios for `time`:
- If `h` is '12' or '09', then `time` is 'AM'.
- Otherwise, `time` is 'PM'.

The `sep=''` parameter in the `print` function means that there will be no separator between the printed items, so the output will be a single string combining `h1`, `:`, `m`, a space, and `time`.

Since the exact values of `h1`, `m`, and `time` are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of their possible values.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is one of '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '01', m is an input string, and time is 'AM' if h is '12' or '09', otherwise it is 'PM')**
