Postcondition: `h1` is either '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '01' to '15', `m1` is `m`, `time` is either 'AM', 'PM', or an empty string, `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 1`.
