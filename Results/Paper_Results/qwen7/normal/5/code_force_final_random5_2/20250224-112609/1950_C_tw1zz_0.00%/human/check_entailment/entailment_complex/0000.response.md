Reasoning:
- The function correctly processes the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, the function splits the input string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
- The function then converts the hour from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and determines whether the time is in the AM or PM period.
- However, there is a more efficient way to convert the hour from 24-hour format to 12-hour format using modulo arithmetic and conditional checks, rather than using a large series of if-elif statements.
- Despite the inefficient method used, the logic in the provided code correctly handles all possible inputs within the specified constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440 and 00 ≤ hh ≤ 23, 00 ≤ mm ≤ 59).

Despite the inefficiency, the logic in the provided code is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
