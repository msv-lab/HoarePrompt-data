Output State: **`h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', or a time between '05' and '23', `m1` is equal to the string `m`, `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 1`.**

This means that `h1`, `m1`, `time`, and the number of remaining iterations remain unchanged. The variables `h` and `m` are updated to be the first and second parts of the input string separated by a colon (`:`), respectively.
