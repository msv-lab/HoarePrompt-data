### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Time Conversion Logic**:
   - The code attempts to convert the 24-hour format to 12-hour format by handling each possible hour value separately.
   - For hours from 01 to 12, it directly assigns the same hour to `h1` and sets `time` to "AM".
   - For hours from 13 to 23, it subtracts 12 from the hour and sets `time` to "PM".
   - For hour 00, it assigns 12 to `h1` and sets `time` to "PM".
3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The code prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM/PM`.
   - It uses `sep=' '` to ensure that the time and the AM/PM indicator are separated by a space.

However, there are some issues with the logic and the implementation:

- **Redundant Code**: The code uses multiple `elif` statements to handle each hour individually, which is redundant and can be simplified.
- **Edge Cases**: The code handles the edge cases like `00` and `13-23` correctly, but the rest of the hours (1-12) could be handled more efficiently.
- **Code Simplification**: The current implementation is overly verbose and can be simplified using a more concise approach.

### Corrected Implementation:
A more efficient way to implement this would be:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = int(h) % 12
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        if h1 == 0:
            h1 = 12
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')
```

### Conclusion:
Despite the redundancy and inefficiency, the provided code does correctly convert the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format and outputs the result in the specified format. Therefore, the provided code is logically correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
