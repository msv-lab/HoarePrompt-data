Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and correctly handles the AM/PM designation. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Redundant Code**: The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to handle the conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format. This can be simplified using a more concise approach.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Midnight**: The code incorrectly handles the 00:00 case. It should print "12:00 AM", but the current logic prints "12:00 PM".
3. **General Redundancy**: The code is repetitive and can be streamlined using modulo arithmetic to simplify the conversion process.

Despite these issues, the program does achieve the desired functionality for the given examples. However, it is not the most efficient or elegant solution.

# Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = input().split(':')
        h = int(h)
        time = 'AM' if h < 12 else 'PM'
        h1 = h % 12
        if h1 == 0:
            h1 = 12
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')

# Example usage
func()
```

Given the above reasoning, the original program is close to being correct but can be improved. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
