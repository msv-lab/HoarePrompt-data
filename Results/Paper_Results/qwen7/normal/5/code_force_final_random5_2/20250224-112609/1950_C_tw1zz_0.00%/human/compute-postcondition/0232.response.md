Output State: **`h1` is '07', `m1` is `m`, `time` is '', `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 1`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'07'` to the variable `h1`. None of the other variables (`m1`, `time`, `h`, `m`, `num_iterations`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
