Output State: **`h1` is '08', `m1` is `m`, `time` is 'PM', `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 1`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. This does not affect the values of `h1`, `m1`, `h`, `m`, or `num_iterations`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `time` is updated to `'PM'`.
