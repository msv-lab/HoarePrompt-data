Output State: **`h1` is '', `m1` is `m`, `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns an empty string to `h1` and the value of `m` to `m1`. The values of `time`, `h`, `m`, and `num_iterations` remain unchanged from their initial states.
