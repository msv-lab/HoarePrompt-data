Output State: **`h1` is '04', `m1` is `m`, `time` is 'PM', `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
