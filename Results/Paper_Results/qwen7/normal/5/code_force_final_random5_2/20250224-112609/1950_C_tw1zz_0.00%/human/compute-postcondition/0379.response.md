Postcondition: **`h1` is either '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12'. `m1` is `m`. `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '12' or '09', otherwise `time` is 'PM'. `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 2`.**
