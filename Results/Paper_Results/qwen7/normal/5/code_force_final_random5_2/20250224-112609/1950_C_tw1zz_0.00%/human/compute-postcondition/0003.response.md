Output State: **`h1` is an empty string, `m1` is equal to the string `m`, `time` is an empty string.**

The code assigns an empty string to the variable `time`. This does not affect the values of `h1` or `m1`. Therefore, `h1` remains an empty string, `m1` remains equal to the string `m`, and `time` is now an empty string.
