Output State: **`h1` is '10', `m1` is `m`, `time` is '', `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 1`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'10'` to the variable `h1`. This does not affect any other variables or the number of remaining iterations. Therefore, the values of `m1`, `time`, `h`, `m`, and `num_iterations` remain unchanged from their initial states.
