Output State: **`h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '01' to '15', `m1` is `m`, `time` is either 'AM', 'PM', or an empty string, `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))` takes an input string, splits it by the colon `:`, and assigns the resulting strings to `h` and `m`. This means `h` now holds the hour part of the time and `m` holds the minute part of the time. The values of `h1`, `m1`, `time`, and `num_iterations` remain unchanged.
