Output State: **`h1` is '04', `m1` is equal to the string `m`, `time` is 'AM'**.

The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `h1` and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `time` and retains the original values of `h1` and `m1`.
