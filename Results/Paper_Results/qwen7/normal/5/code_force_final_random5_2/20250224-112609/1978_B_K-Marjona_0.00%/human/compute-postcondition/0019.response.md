Output: **a * n (where n is the first integer entered by the user and a is the second integer entered by the user)**

Explanation:
- `t` is a positive integer, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is the first integer entered by the user.
- `a` is the second integer entered by the user.
- `b` is the third integer entered by the user.
- `k` is the minimum value between the new `n` and `b - a`, but this value is not used in the print statement.

The print statement `print(a * n)` will print the product of `a` and `n`, where `n` is the first integer entered by the user and `a` is the second integer entered by the user.
