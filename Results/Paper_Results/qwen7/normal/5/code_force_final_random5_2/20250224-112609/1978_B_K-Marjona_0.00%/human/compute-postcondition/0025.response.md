Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: the number of buns (n), the usual price of a bun (a), and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b). It calculates the total cost of buying n buns under the given pricing conditions and prints the result for each test case. If the modified price (b) is less than or equal to the usual price (a), it calculates the total cost based on the usual price. Otherwise, it calculates the total cost considering both the usual and modified prices for the respective buns.**
