Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value of the minimum between `n` and `b - a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
