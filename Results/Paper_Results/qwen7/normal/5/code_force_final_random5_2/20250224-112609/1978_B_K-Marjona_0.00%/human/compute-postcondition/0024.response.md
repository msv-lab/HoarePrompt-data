Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: n, a, and b. It calculates the total cost of buying n buns where the first b buns are sold at a modified price a and the rest at the usual price a. The function does not return anything explicitly but implies processing each test case and potentially printing or using the results internally.**
