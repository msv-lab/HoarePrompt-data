### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to check if we can make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container's index is always less than the destination container's index.
   - The key insight is that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, meaning the average amount of water per container is an integer.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, it implies that the average amount of water per container is an integer. This means that if we can redistribute the water such that each container ends up with this average amount, the condition is satisfied.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water per container (`mean`), which is the total amount divided by `n`.
   - It iterates through the list of water amounts and keeps track of the difference between the current cumulative amount and the expected cumulative amount if all containers had the mean value.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water to meet the requirement, so it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it means the redistribution is possible, so it returns 'YES'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n` correctly by returning 'NO' immediately.
   - The code also correctly handles the case where the redistribution is possible by ensuring the cumulative difference never goes negative.

5. **Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - The function `func_1` initializes the total amount of water and the number of containers.
   - It then checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It calculates the mean amount of water per container.
   - It iterates through the list of water amounts, keeping track of the cumulative difference from the mean.
   - If the cumulative difference ever becomes negative, it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it returns 'YES'.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers and ensures that the cumulative difference from the mean never goes negative.

**Final: True**
