### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and the function summary to ensure the correctness:

1. **Sum Divisibility Check**:
   - The program first checks if the total sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`. This is crucial because if the total sum is not divisible by `n`, it is impossible to distribute the water evenly among the containers. The program correctly identifies this scenario and returns 'NO'.

2. **Mean Calculation**:
   - If the sum is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the mean amount of water per container. This step ensures that we know the target amount of water each container should have to be balanced.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - The program then iterates through each container and maintains a running sum of the deviations from the mean. If at any point the cumulative deviation becomes negative, it indicates that it is impossible to balance the containers without violating the condition that water can only be poured from a container with more water to a container with less water. The program correctly identifies this scenario and returns 'NO'.
   - If the cumulative deviation never becomes negative, it means the containers can be balanced, and the program returns 'YES'.

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the `func_1` function. It correctly states that the function checks if the cumulative deviation from the mean remains non-negative throughout the iteration. If the cumulative deviation ever becomes negative or the total sum of `nums` is not divisible by its length, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
