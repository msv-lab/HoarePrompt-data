Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water between them.
2. The key insight is that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers. This means the average amount of water per container is an integer.
3. The function `func_1` correctly checks if it's possible to achieve this by ensuring the cumulative deviation from the mean remains non-negative.
4. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the function:
   - Calculate the total amount of water and check if it is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, return 'NO'.
   - Calculate the mean amount of water per container.
   - Iterate through the list of water amounts, keeping track of the cumulative deviation from the mean.
   - If at any point the cumulative deviation goes below zero, return 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'NO', return 'YES'.

Given the logic and the steps outlined, the function correctly determines if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Correctness: **True**
