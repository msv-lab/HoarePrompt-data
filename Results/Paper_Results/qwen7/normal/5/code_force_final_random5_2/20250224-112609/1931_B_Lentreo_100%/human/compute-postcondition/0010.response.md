Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is `total` // `n`, `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` by adding `nums[i] - mean` to `curr`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `curr` is updated to `nums[0] - mean`. After this update, `i` is incremented to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
