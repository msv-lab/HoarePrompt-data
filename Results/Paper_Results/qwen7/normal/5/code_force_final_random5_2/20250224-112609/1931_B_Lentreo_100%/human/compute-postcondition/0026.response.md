Output State: `total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is `total` // `n`, `curr` is the sum of `nums[i] - mean` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, and if `curr` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, the function returns 'NO'. If the loop completes without returning 'NO', then `curr` will be 0 because the sum of all `nums[i] - mean` will cancel out to zero.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `curr` will be 0 (since the sum of deviations from the mean over all elements must balance out to zero), `i` will be equal to `n` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), and the function will not have returned 'NO' unless `curr` went below 0 at some point during the loop.
