### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container's index is always less than the destination container's index.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, then it is possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers. This is because the average amount of water per container is an integer, and we can always redistribute the water to achieve this average.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water per container (`mean`), which is the total amount divided by `n`.
   - It iterates through the list of water amounts and keeps track of the difference between the current cumulative amount and the expected cumulative amount if all containers had the mean value.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water to meet the requirement, so it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it means the redistribution is possible, so it returns 'YES'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n` correctly by returning 'NO' immediately.
   - The code also correctly handles the case where the redistribution is possible by ensuring the cumulative difference never goes negative.

5. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if the redistribution is possible.
   - The loop ensures that the cumulative difference between the actual and expected amounts of water does not go negative, which would indicate an impossible redistribution.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
