### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Sum Divisibility Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - This is crucial because if the sum is not divisible by `n`, it is impossible to make the amounts of water in all containers equal.

2. **Mean Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the mean amount of water per container as `mean = total // n`.
   - This is the target amount of water each container should have if they are to be equal.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - The program iterates through each container and keeps track of the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the mean.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means there is no way to balance the containers without violating the rule that water can only be poured from a container with more water to a container with less water.
   - If the cumulative difference never goes negative, it implies that it is possible to balance the containers.

Given the annotations and the logic of the program, the steps are sound and align with the problem requirements. The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to make the amounts of water in all containers equal.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations. It accurately checks the divisibility of the total sum by `n`, calculates the mean, and ensures that the cumulative difference never goes negative, which confirms the possibility of balancing the containers.
