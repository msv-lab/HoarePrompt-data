Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value of `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `total` is equal to the sum of `nums`.
   - `n` is the length of `nums`.
   - The sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`.
   - `mean` is `total` // `n`.
   - `curr` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `i` should start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.

Given this analysis, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` starts at 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is `total` // `n`, `curr` is 0, `i` is 0**
