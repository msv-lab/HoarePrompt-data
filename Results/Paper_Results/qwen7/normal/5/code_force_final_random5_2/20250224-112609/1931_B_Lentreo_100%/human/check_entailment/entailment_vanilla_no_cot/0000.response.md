Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum Calculation and Mean Check**: For each test case, it calculates the total amount of water and checks if this total is divisible by the number of containers `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
3. **Balance Check**: It then iterates through the list of water amounts and keeps a running balance of the difference between the current cumulative sum and the target mean value. If at any point the balance goes negative, it means it's impossible to equalize the water amounts, and it returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

This approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and correct according to the problem statement.
