Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Here's why:

1. **Sum Divisibility Check**: The program first checks if the total sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'NO', which is correct because making the amounts equal would require the total sum to be divisible by `n`.

2. **Mean Calculation**: If the sum is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the mean amount of water per container (`mean = total // n`).

3. **Balance Check**: The program then iterates through each container and checks if the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the mean is ever negative. If it is, it means it's impossible to balance the containers without violating the condition that water can only be poured from a container with more water to a container with less water. In such a case, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Given these steps, the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
