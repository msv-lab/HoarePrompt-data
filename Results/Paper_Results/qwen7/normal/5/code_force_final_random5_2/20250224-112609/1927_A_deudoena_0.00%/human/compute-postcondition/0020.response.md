Output State: **The loop has executed fully, and `ind1` is set to the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, or remains 0 if 'B' does not appear in `inpstr`. The value of `i` is equal to the length of `inpstr`, `j` is the last character of `inpstr`, and `outind` remains 0.**

In this final state, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `ind1` will hold the index of the first 'B' found in `inpstr`, or it will remain 0 if 'B' was not present. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `inpstr` because the loop increments `i` with each iteration until it reaches the end of the string. The variable `j` will be the last character of `inpstr` since it is assigned the current character in each iteration. Lastly, `outind` remains unchanged at 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
