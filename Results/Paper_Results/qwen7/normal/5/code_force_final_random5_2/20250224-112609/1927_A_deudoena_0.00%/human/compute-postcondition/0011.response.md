Output State: **`j` is a string that is not equal to 'B', `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous value, and `ind1` is equal to the new value of `i`.**

Explanation: The line `ind1 = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `ind1`. Since `i` was incremented by 1 from its previous value, `ind1` now holds this updated value of `i`. The variable `j` remains unchanged as it is a string not equal to 'B', and `ind1` retains its previous value before the assignment.
