Output State: **`j` is a string that is not equal to 'B', `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous value, and `ind1` is equal to the new value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ind1 = i` simply assigns the current value of `i` to `ind1`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `ind1` now holds that new value of `i`. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment.
