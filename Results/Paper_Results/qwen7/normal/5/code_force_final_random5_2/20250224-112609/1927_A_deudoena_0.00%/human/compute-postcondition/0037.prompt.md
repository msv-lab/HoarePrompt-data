Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed fully, and `ind1` is set to the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, or remains 0 if 'B' does not appear in `inpstr`. The value of `i` is equal to the length of `inpstr`, `j` is the last character of `inpstr`, and `outind` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(inpstr)):
    if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
        ind2 = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is less than `len(inpstr)`, and if `inpstr[-i - 1]` is equal to 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `inpstr[-i - 1]` is not equal to 'B', the same conditions hold without any changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is less than `len(inpstr)`, and if `inpstr[-i - 1]` is equal to 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `inpstr[-i - 1]` is not equal to 'B', the conditions remain the same without any changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, and `ind2` is `i + 1`. If `inpstr[-i - 1]` is equal to 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `inpstr[-i - 1]` is not equal to 'B', the conditions remain the same without any changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
