Based on the initial state provided:

- `ind2` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' from the end of `inpstr`.
- If 'B' does not appear in `inpstr`, `ind2` remains 0.
- The value of `i` is `len(inpstr)`.
- `j` is the last character of `inpstr`.
- `outind` remains 0.

The expression to be evaluated is `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.

However, there is no mention of `ind1` in the initial state. Given the context, it seems like `ind1` might be another index related to the string `inpstr`, but since it is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. For the sake of this problem, let's assume `ind1` is not relevant to the final calculation, and focus on the known variables.

Given that `ind2` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' from the end of `inpstr`, and if 'B' does not appear, `ind2` remains 0, the expression simplifies to:

- If 'B' appears in `inpstr`, `ind2` will be a valid index (let's denote it as `k`).
- If 'B' does not appear, `ind2` is 0.

The expression becomes `len(inpstr) - k - ind1`. Since `ind1` is not defined, we will consider the simplest case where `ind1` is irrelevant or zero.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **len(inpstr) - ind2**
