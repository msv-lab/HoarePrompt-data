You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell is black.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: The loop has executed fully, and `ind1` is set to the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, or remains 0 if 'B' does not appear in `inpstr`. The value of `i` is equal to the length of `inpstr`, `j` is the last character of `inpstr`, and `outind` remains 0.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: The loop has executed fully, and `ind2` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' from the end of `inpstr`. If 'B' does not appear in `inpstr`, `ind2` remains 0. The value of `i` is `len(inpstr)`, `j` is the last character of `inpstr`, and `outind` remains 0.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: len(inpstr) - ind2
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a series of test cases where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. It returns a value based on the conditions specified for the string `s`, specifically checking if there is at least one black cell ('B').

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
