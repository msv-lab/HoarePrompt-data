You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. After all the iterations of the loop, `t` will still be the same as its initial value because the loop does not modify `t`. For each iteration, the loop reads two integers `n` and `m`, checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if their difference is even. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. Regardless of the outcome of these checks, the value of `t` remains unchanged.
    #
    #In summary, the final value of `t` is the same as its initial value, and the loop's output ('YES' or 'NO') depends on the values of `n` and `m` provided during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two positive integers n and m within the range 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, where n and m are derived from a test case with a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). It returns a result based on the values of n and m.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
