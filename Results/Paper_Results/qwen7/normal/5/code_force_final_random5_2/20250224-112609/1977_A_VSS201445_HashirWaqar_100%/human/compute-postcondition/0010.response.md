Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is the first integer input by the user.
- `m` is the second integer input by the user.
- `n` and `m` are converted to integers.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the values of `n` and `m` do not affect the output of this specific print statement, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
