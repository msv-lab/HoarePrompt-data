Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is confirmed by the loop that iterates `t` times.

2. **Condition Checking**: For each test case, the program checks if `n` (number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (desired number of cubes) and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. These conditions are necessary and sufficient to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Output**: Based on the conditions checked, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. This matches the problem statement requirements.

4. **State Preservation**: The state of the variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the execution, which is correct since `t` is only used to control the number of iterations and not modified within the loop.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for the given examples, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
