Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and `(n - m)` is an even number, then no change is made to `t`. If `n` is less than `m` or `(n - m)` is not an even number, then no change is made to `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user, and `n` and `m` are converted to integers. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the integer input by the user, `m` is the integer input by the user in the previous iteration. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even, then no change is made to `t`. Otherwise, no change is made to `t`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
