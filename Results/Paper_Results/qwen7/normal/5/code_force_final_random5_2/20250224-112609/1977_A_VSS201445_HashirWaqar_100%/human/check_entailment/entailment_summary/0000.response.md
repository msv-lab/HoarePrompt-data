Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Conditions Check**: For each test case, it checks if \( n \geq m \) and if \( (n - m) \) is even.
   - \( n \geq m \): This condition ensures that there are enough moves to potentially achieve the desired number of cubes.
   - \( (n - m) \) is even: This condition ensures that the difference between the total moves and the desired number of cubes is even. Since each move either adds or removes one cube, the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference must match for the final count to be achievable.

Given these conditions, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves. The provided examples in the execution summary also validate this logic.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
