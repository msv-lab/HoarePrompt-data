Output State: The value of `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. After all the iterations of the loop, `t` will still be the same as its initial value because the loop does not modify `t`. For each iteration, the loop reads two integers `n` and `m`, checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if their difference is even. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. Regardless of the outcome of these checks, the value of `t` remains unchanged.

In summary, the final value of `t` is the same as its initial value, and the loop's output ('YES' or 'NO') depends on the values of `n` and `m` provided during each iteration.
