Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, the program reads two integers `n` and `m`.
3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even.
   - If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
4. **Output Consistency**: The program ensures that the output is consistent with the problem statement. It outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case without modifying the state of `t`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Correctness: **True**
