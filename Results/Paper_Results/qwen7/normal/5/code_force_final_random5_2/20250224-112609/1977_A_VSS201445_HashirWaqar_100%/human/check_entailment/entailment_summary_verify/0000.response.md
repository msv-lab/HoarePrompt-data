Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- **Moves**: Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
- **Conditions**:
  - To end up with `m` cubes, the net number of cubes added must be `m`.
  - The total number of moves `n` must be at least `m` because we need at least `m` moves to add `m` cubes.
  - The difference between the number of additions and removals must be even to ensure that the net effect is `m`.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even.
- It prints 'YES' if both conditions are met; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Condition Check**:
   - `n >= m`: Ensures there are enough moves to potentially reach `m` cubes.
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: Ensures the difference between the number of additions and removals is even, which is necessary to achieve exactly `m` cubes.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n < m`, it is impossible to end up with `m` cubes, so the condition `n >= m` is correctly checked.
   - If `(n - m) % 2 != 0`, it means the difference is odd, and it is impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes, so the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is correctly checked.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints 'YES' if both conditions are satisfied, which matches the problem requirements.
   - The function prints 'NO' if either condition fails, which also matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions and logic are consistent with the problem statement and the provided function summary.

Final: **True**
