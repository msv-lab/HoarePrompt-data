Output State: **`start` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1.**

The variable `end` is assigned the value of `len(lst) - 1`, which means `end` now holds the index of the last element in the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
