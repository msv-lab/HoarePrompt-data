Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `m`, `d1`, `d2`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and the nature of `a` and `m` are preserved.
