Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is stored in the variable `lst`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `d1`, `d2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
