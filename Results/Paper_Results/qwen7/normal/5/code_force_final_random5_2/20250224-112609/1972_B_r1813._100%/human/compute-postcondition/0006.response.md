Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is a string of length `data[index + 1]` consisting only of "U" and "D", `index` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `s = data[index + 1]` updates the variable `s` to be the value of `data[index + 1]`. Given the initial state, `index` is 2, so `s` is now set to `data[3]`. The precondition that `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D" remains valid, and `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, which is `data[2]`. Therefore, `s` is now a string of length `data[3]` consisting only of "U" and "D". All other variables remain unchanged.
