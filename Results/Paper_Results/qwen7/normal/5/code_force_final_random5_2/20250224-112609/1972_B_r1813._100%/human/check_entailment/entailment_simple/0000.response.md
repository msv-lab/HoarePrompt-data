Reasoning:
1. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes each one individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the number of coins (`n`) and the state of the coins (`s`).
3. It counts the number of 'U' (up-facing) coins in the string `s`.
4. The logic to determine the winner is based on whether the count of 'U' coins is odd or even:
   - If the count of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins.
   - If the count of 'U' coins is even, Bob wins.
5. The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement.
6. The program does not have any logical errors or unnecessary steps that could lead to incorrect results.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
