Postcondition: `t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `s` is a string of length `data[3]` consisting only of "U" and "D", `index` is 4, and `count_u` is the number of 'U' in the string `s`. If the count of 'U' in `s` is odd, then `count_u` remains as the odd count. If the count of 'U' in `s` is even, then `count_u` remains as the even count.
