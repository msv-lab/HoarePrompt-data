Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: It iterates over the test cases, extracting the number of coins \( n \) and the string \( s \) for each case.
3. **Counting 'U' Characters**: For each string \( s \), it counts the number of 'U' characters.
4. **Determining Winner**: If the count of 'U' characters is odd, it prints 'YES', indicating that Alice wins. Otherwise, it prints 'NO', indicating that Bob wins.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, this logic is correct. The program correctly determines the winner based on the count of 'U' characters in each test case.

Correctness: **True**
