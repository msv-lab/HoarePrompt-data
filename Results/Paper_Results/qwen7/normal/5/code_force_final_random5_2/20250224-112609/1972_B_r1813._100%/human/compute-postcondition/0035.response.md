Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes variables t, n, and s, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; and s is a string of length n consisting only of "U" and "D". For each test case defined by t, the function returns a specific output based on the string s.**
