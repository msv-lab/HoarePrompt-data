Postcondition: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer minus 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `s` is now the string `data[5]`, `index` is 7, `count_u` is the number of 'U' in the string `s`. `count_u` is updated to the count of 'U' in the string `s`.**

Explanation: Since both the if and else parts have the same postconditions, the overall postcondition remains unchanged regardless of whether the if condition is true or false. Therefore, the value of `count_u` will always be updated to the count of 'U' in the string `s`.
