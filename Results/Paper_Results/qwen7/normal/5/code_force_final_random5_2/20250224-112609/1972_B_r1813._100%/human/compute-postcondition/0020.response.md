Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer minus 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `s` is now the string `data[5]`, `index` is 7, `count_u` is the number of 'U' in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Initially, `index` was set to 5. After executing the code, `index` becomes 7. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
