Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`loop`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`innerLoop`).

2. **Storing Constraints:**
   - It initializes three lists: `big`, `less`, and `no`.
   - For each constraint, it appends the value `a` to the appropriate list based on the value of `x`.

3. **Finding Valid Range:**
   - The program attempts to find the smallest value in `big` and the largest value in `less`.
   - It then tries to find the first integer `i` within this range that is not in the `no` list.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the first valid integer `i` found or `0` if no such integer exists.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Valid Range:**
   - The program uses `max(big)` and `min(less)` to define the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. This logic assumes that the range is continuous, but it does not handle cases where the range might be discontinuous.
   - For example, if `big` is `[3, 10]` and `less` is `[5, 15]`, the range would be `[10, 5]`, which is invalid.

2. **Handling Discontinuous Ranges:**
   - The program only checks the first integer within the range `[max(big), min(less)]` that is not in `no`. This approach fails when there are multiple valid ranges or when the valid range is not contiguous.
   - For instance, if `big` is `[3, 10]` and `less` is `[15, 20]`, the valid range is `[10, 15)`, and the program will not correctly identify this range.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the valid range is empty or where the constraints are contradictory (e.g., `k >= 10` and `k <= 5`).

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify all valid ranges.
2. Ensure that the valid ranges do not overlap or contradict each other.
3. Count the number of integers within these valid ranges.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for _ in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = set()
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for _ in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.add(a)
        
        # Sort and remove duplicates
        big.sort()
        less.sort()
        
        # Find valid ranges
        valid_ranges = []
        prev_less = float('-inf')
        for l in less:
            if l > prev_less + 1:
                valid_ranges.append((prev_less + 1, l - 1))
            prev_less = l
        
        if len(big) > 0:
            if big[0] > prev_less + 1:
                valid_ranges.append((prev_less + 1, big[0] - 1))
        
        for b in big:
            if b < max(less):
                valid_ranges.append((b + 1, max(less) - 1))
        
        # Remove invalid values from no
        for n in no:
            for i, (start, end) in enumerate(valid_ranges):
                if start <= n <= end:
                    valid_ranges[i] = (start, n - 1) if n > start else (n + 1, end)
        
        # Count the number of valid integers
        count = 0
        for start, end in valid_ranges:
            count += max(0, end - start)
        
        print(count)

func()
```

The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly for the given problem. Therefore, the original program is:
