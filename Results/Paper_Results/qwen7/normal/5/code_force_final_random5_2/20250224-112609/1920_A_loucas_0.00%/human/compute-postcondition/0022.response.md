Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `a` is appended to `big`, `iterable2` is 1, and `innerLoop` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. The values of `x`, `iterable2`, and `innerLoop` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `a` is added to the list `big`.
