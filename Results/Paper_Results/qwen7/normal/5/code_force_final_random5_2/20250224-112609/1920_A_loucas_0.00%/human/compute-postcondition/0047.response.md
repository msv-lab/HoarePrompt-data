Postcondition: `i` is an integer within the range `min(less)` to `max(big) - 1`, and `num` is equal to `i`. If `i` is not in the set `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in the set `no`, no specific action is taken other than continuing to check other conditions or loops.
