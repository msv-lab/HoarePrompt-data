Output State: **`i` is an integer within the range `min(less)` to `max(big) - 1`, and `max(big)` is greater than `min(less)`, `num` is equal to `i`, and `i` is not in the set `no`.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` was initially an integer within the specified range and not in the set `no`, `num` now holds the same value as `i`, but the conditions regarding the range and the set `no` remain unchanged.
