Output State: `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `num` is the maximum value between all elements in the `big` list, and `num` is not in the `no` list.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `iterable2` will have gone through every value from 0 to `innerLoop - 1`. The loop will iterate over the range defined by `max(big)` to `min(less)`, and it will break as soon as it finds an `i` that is not in the `no` list. Therefore, `num` will end up being the highest value in the `big` list that is not present in the `no` list.
