Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `a` is appended to `big`, `iterable2` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. The values of `x`, `iterable2`, and `innerLoop` remain unchanged. The current value of `x` is specified as 1, which remains unaffected by the code.
