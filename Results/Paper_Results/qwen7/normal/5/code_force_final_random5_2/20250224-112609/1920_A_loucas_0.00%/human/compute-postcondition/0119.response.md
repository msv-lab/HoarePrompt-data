Output State: **`less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `no` as an empty list. The initial states of `less` and `big` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, `less` and `big` are both still empty lists, and `no` is also an empty list.
