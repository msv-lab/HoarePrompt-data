Output State: **`i` is `min(less) + 2`, `num` is `min(less) + 2`, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `x` and `a` will depend on the inputs provided during the next iteration, `big`, `less`, and `no` will contain all the values of `a` that correspond to the respective conditions across all iterations of the loop.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `big`. The values of `i`, `num`, `less`, `x`, `a`, `big`, `less`, and `no` remain unchanged from their initial state. The only difference is that now `big` is an empty list.
