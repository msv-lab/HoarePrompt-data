Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `i` is either `max(big)` (if it is the first iteration) or `i + 1` from the previous value, and `i not in no` must still hold true. If `i not in no` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i not in no` is false, no change occurs to the variables.
