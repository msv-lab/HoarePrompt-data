Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `i` is either within the range `[max(big), min(less)) + 1)` and not in `no`, or `i` has been set to `num` and the most internal loop or if statement has been broken, while `less` must contain at least 3 integers, `no` must contain at least 3 integers, and `big` must contain at least 1 integer.
