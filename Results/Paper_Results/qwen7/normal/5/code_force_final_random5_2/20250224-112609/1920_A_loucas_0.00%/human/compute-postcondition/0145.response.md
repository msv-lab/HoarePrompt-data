Output State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 2, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is a list containing `a` and `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `num` is 0**

Explanation: The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `big` was originally a list containing `a`, after appending `a` again, `big` now contains both instances of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
