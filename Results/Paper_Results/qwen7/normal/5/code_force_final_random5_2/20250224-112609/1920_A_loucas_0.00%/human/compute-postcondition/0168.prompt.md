Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing inputs for all `x` where `x` was 2, `big` is a list containing inputs for all `x` where `x` was 1, `no` is a list containing inputs for all `x` where `x` was 3, `num` is 0, and `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer. After all iterations, `iterable2` will have gone through every value from 0 to `innerLoop - 1`, and based on the value of `x` for each iteration, `less`, `big`, and `no` lists will be populated accordingly.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`. If `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `i not in no` is false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `i` is the current value of `num`, and `i not in no` must still hold true. If `i not in no` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, and `num` is equal to `i`. If `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
