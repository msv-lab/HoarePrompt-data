Postcondition: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `i` is `min(less) + 2`, `num` is 0, `less` is a list containing `a`, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, and `iterable2` is 1. If `x` equals 2, then `no` remains as either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`. Otherwise, `no` becomes a list containing `[a]`**.
