Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

# Annotated Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    b = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(b))
for result in results:
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: Output State: `len_unique` is less than or equal to `i`, every key in `char_map` is paired with its corresponding character such that `char_map[unique_chars[j]]` equals `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]` for all valid `j`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `char_map` will contain mappings for each unique character in `encoded`, where each character is mapped to its mirror character in the sorted list of unique characters. If `len_unique` is odd, the middle character will be its own mapping. If `len_unique` is even, all characters will be paired symmetrically.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, which is the result of replacing each character in the original `encoded` string using the mappings defined in `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded`. It creates a mapping between each unique character in `encoded` and its corresponding character based on a mirrored sorted order of unique characters. If the number of unique characters is odd, the middle character maps to itself. The function then uses this mapping to replace each character in the original `encoded` string to produce the `decoded` string.
