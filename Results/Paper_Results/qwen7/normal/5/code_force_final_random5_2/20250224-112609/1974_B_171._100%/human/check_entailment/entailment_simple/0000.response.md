Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. The `func_1` function is designed to decode the encoded string back to the original string.
3. The function first creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string.
4. It then creates a dictionary (`char_map`) that maps each unique character to its corresponding mirrored character in the sorted list of unique characters.
5. Finally, it uses this dictionary to construct the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its mapped character.
6. The logic in `func_1` accurately implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
