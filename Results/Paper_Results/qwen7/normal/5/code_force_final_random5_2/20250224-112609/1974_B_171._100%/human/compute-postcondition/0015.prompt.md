You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: Output State: `len_unique` is less than or equal to `i`, every key in `char_map` is paired with its corresponding character such that `char_map[unique_chars[j]]` equals `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]` for all valid `j`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `char_map` will contain mappings for each unique character in `encoded`, where each character is mapped to its mirror character in the sorted list of unique characters. If `len_unique` is odd, the middle character will be its own mapping. If `len_unique` is even, all characters will be paired symmetrically.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, which is the result of replacing each character in the original `encoded` string using the mappings defined in `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a decoded string `decoded` by replacing each character in `encoded` according to predefined mappings in `char_map`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string `decoded`, which is the result of replacing each character in the original `encoded` string using the mappings defined in `char_map`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
