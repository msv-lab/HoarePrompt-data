The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded`. It creates a mapping between each unique character in `encoded` and its corresponding character based on a mirrored sorted order of unique characters. If the number of unique characters is odd, the middle character maps to itself. The function then uses this mapping to replace each character in the original `encoded` string to produce the `decoded` string.
