Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len_unique)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len_unique`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len_unique`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `len_unique` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `char_map[unique_chars[1]]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 2]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - `len_unique` must remain greater than 0 because it is the upper bound of the range.

5. **Check the condition involving `char_map` and `unique_chars`**:
   - The condition `char_map[unique_chars[1]] == unique_chars[len_unique - 2]` needs to be maintained. At the end of the previous iteration, this condition holds true. Therefore, no change is needed for this specific condition.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 3.
- `len_unique` must still be greater than 0.
- The condition `char_map[unique_chars[1]] == unique_chars[len_unique - 2]` remains valid.

So, the final state is:

**State: `len_unique` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `char_map[unique_chars[1]]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 2]`**
