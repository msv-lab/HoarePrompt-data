Output State: `len_unique` is less than or equal to `i`, for every key-value pair (k, v) in `char_map`, `k` is an element in `unique_chars` and `v` is the corresponding element from the end of `unique_chars`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `len_unique` will be less than or equal to `i`, meaning `i` will be one more than `len_unique`. The dictionary `char_map` will map each character in `unique_chars` to its corresponding character from the end of the list `unique_chars`.
