Output State: **`len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded`, sorted alphabetically, and `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the `unique_chars` list and assigns it to the variable `len_unique`. The length of `unique_chars` is determined by the number of unique characters in the `encoded` string. The `unique_chars` list remains unchanged, and `char_map` stays an empty dictionary.
