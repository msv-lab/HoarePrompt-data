Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads multiple test cases from standard input. It correctly handles the reading of the number of test cases (`t`), the length of the encoded string (`n`), and the encoded string itself (`b`).

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - **Unique Characters**: The program constructs a set of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - **Character Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its corresponding symmetric character in `r`.
   - **Decoding**: For each character in the encoded string `b`, it uses the `char_map` to find the corresponding character in the original string `s`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character Strings**: The program correctly handles single-character strings. For example, the input `"w"` is correctly decoded to `"w"`.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**: The program processes multiple test cases correctly, ensuring that each encoded string is decoded independently.
   - **Symmetry Handling**: The program correctly handles the symmetry of the mapping, ensuring that each character is mapped to its correct symmetric counterpart.

Given the provided examples and the structure of the program, it appears that the program correctly decodes the encoded strings for all potential cases described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
