Output State: The value of `x` and `y` will be determined by the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `x` and `y` will reflect the last set of values entered by the user. For each iteration, if `a[y] - a[x - 1] >= b[y] - b[x - 1]` and `x != y`, the program will print 'YES'; otherwise, it will print 'NO'. The final output state will consist of the cumulative results of these comparisons printed during each iteration.

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers entered by the user. The program will have printed 'YES' for each valid comparison (where `a[y] - a[x - 1] >= b[y] - b[x - 1]` and `x != y`) and 'NO' for each invalid comparison (where `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`).
