You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is 1 or 2 based on the value of `a[i]`, `b[1]` is 2, `b[2]` is 3, ..., `b[n]` is either 3 or 4, depending on the value of `a[i]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a[i]` is greater than 1 for all `i` from 1 to `n`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `x` will be either 1 or 2, depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not. The list `b` will have been updated such that each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) will be 3 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, or 4 if `a[i]` is not greater than 1. The conditions that `n` must be at least 3 and that `a[i]` must be greater than 1 for all `i` from 1 to `n` must still hold.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `x` and `y` will be determined by the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variables `x` and `y` will hold the values from the last input provided to the loop. For each input pair `(x, y)`, the program will print 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or if `x == y`, otherwise it will print 'YES'. The final output state will reflect the results of all these comparisons.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` and `y` will be set to the values of the last input pair provided to the loop. The program will have printed 'NO' or 'YES' for each input pair based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] >= b[y] - b[x - 1]` and `x != y`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers n and q, a list c of n positive integers, and q queries, where each query consists of integers l_i and r_i. It returns the results of these queries based on the values in list c.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
