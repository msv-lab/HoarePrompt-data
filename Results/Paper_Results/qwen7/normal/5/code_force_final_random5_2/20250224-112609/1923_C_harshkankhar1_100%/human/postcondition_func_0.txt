The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( q \), followed by a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. It then handles \( q \) queries, each consisting of two integers \( x \) and \( y \). Based on the values in the list \( a \), the function compares the sums of subarrays defined by the queries and prints 'YES' if the sum of the subarray from index \( x \) to \( y \) in list \( a \) is greater than or equal to the corresponding sum in list \( b \), and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value but prints the results of the queries.
