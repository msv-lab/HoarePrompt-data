Output State: **t is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `q`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values replace the previous values of `t`, which remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. The values of `n` and `q` are updated to the integers read from the input, but their specific values are not known until runtime.
