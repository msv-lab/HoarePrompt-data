State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and we have read an input for `t`, `qi` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `qi` starts from 0 and increments with each iteration.
2. The loop runs for `t` times, where `t` is the number of inputs read.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 (since the loop runs from `qi = 0` to `qi < t`).
4. The initial value of `qi` should be set to 0 so that the loop can start its first iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `qi` is 0 and `t` is an integer within the specified range.
