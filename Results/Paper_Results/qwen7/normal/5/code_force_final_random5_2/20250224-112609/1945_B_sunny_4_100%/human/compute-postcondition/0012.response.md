Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `qi` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`, `a` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer, `m` is updated to an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. The initial values of `t`, `qi`, `ans` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the input integers.
