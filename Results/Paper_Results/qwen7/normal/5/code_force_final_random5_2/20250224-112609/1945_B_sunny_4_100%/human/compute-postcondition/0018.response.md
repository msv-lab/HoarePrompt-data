Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) and calculates the value of \( \text{m} // a + \text{m} // b + 2 \). It then prints this calculated value for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
