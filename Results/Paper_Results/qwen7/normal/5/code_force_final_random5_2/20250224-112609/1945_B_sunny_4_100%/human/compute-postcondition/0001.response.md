Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and we have read an input for `t`.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input for `t`, which means `t` now holds the value of the input received. All other conditions and constraints remain the same, so `t` is still within the range 1 to 10^4. The variables `a`, `b`, `m`, `A`, and `B` have not been defined or assigned any values yet, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
