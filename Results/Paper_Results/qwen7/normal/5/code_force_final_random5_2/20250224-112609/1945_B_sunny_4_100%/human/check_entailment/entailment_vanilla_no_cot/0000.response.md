Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program has an error in its logic for calculating the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The formula used in the program, `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`, does not correctly account for the overlaps between the intervals where fireworks are launched by the two installations.

To find the correct solution, we need to use the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of the combined pattern of launches. The correct approach involves calculating the LCM of `a` and `b`, and then determining how many fireworks can be seen simultaneously within one period of the LCM.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within one period of lcm_ab
        A = (lcm_ab - 1) // a + 1
        B = (lcm_ab - 1) // b + 1
        # The maximum number of fireworks seen at the same time is A + B - 1 (since they overlap at least once)
        max_visible = A + B - 1
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected program uses the LCM to determine the periodicity and calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously by considering the overlaps correctly.
