Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `qi` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and we have read an input for `t`. This means `t` is already set to some value within this range.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `qi` is less than `t`. Therefore, the loop will start with `qi` being 0 (the default starting value for `range(t)`).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since `t` is already set to a valid value, no adjustment is needed for `t`. However, `qi` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to start executing.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `qi` should be 0.
- `t` should be set to its valid range value (which is already given as \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)).

Therefore, the final state is:

**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `qi` is 0.**
