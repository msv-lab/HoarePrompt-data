Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `qi` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input using the `input().split()` method and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. The variable `ans` is defined as `m // a + m // b + 2`. Since the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are obtained from the input, they are now specific input integers. The values of `t` and `qi` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
