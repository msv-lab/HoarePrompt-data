Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, the program needs to read the input, process the array to maximize the sum of its elements using the allowed operations, and output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations. However, the provided code does not perform any of these steps. Instead, it directly prints predefined outputs without considering the actual input or performing any necessary computations. This makes the program incorrect for any input that does not match the hardcoded scenarios.
