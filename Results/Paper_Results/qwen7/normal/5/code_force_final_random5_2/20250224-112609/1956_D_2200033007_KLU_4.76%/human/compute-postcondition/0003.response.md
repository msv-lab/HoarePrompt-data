Output: **1 2**

Explanation: The initial state defines that `c` is a list of integers, but the specific content of the list is not provided. However, the print statement does not reference any elements of the list `c`. Instead, it directly prints the string "1 2". Therefore, regardless of the contents of the list `c`, the output will be exactly "1 2".
