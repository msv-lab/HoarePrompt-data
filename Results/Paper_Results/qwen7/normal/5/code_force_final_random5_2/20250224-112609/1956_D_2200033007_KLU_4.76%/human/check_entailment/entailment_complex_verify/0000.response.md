### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input values for `n` and the array `a`.
   - The array `a` is split from the string input and stored in the list `a`.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The function `func_1(len(a))` is called with the length of the array `a` as an argument.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `c` as an argument, which represents the length of the array `a`.
   - The function then prints two outputs based on the value of `c`:
     - If `c == 2`, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2".
     - Otherwise, it prints "13 0".

Now, let's consider the problem requirements:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` using the allowed operations.
- The operations involve setting a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded) value of that subarray.
- The function `func_1` is hardcoded to handle only the case when the length of the array is 2, and it provides a fixed solution for this specific case.

### Analysis of the Given Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `2`
   - Input Array: `[0, 1]`
   - Output: `4 1`
   - Explanation: After the operation with `l=1` and `r=2`, the array becomes `[2, 2]`, resulting in a sum of 4. This matches the output.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `3`
   - Input Array: `[1, 3, 9]`
   - Output: `13 0`
   - Explanation: The initial sum is already 13, and no operations are needed to increase it further. This matches the output.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `4`
   - Input Array: `[1, 100, 2, 1]`
   - Output: `105 2`
   - Explanation: After the operations with `l=3` and `r=3`, and then `l=3` and `r=4`, the array becomes `[1, 100, 0, 0]`, resulting in a sum of 101. However, the output suggests a sum of 105, which is incorrect.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `1`
   - Input Array: `[0]`
   - Output: `1 1`
   - Explanation: After the operation with `l=1` and `r=1`, the array becomes `[1]`, resulting in a sum of 1. This matches the output.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` is hardcoded to handle only the case when the length of the array is 2, and it provides a fixed solution for this specific case. For other lengths, it prints a fixed output that does not necessarily reflect the optimal solution. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to solve the problem for all possible inputs.
