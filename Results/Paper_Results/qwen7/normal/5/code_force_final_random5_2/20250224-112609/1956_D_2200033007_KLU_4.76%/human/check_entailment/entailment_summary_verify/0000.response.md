### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program hardcodes the output for specific lengths of the input array and does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. Given the problem constraints and the function summary, we can further analyze why the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `c`.
   - It checks if the length of `c` is exactly 2.
     - If true, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2".
     - If false, it prints "13 0".

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - The program reads the input `n` and the array `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1(len(a))`, passing the length of the array `a` to the function.
   - Based on the length of `a`, `func_1` prints either "4 1" and "1 2" or "13 0".

3. **Evaluation Against Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array elements by performing operations to set a subarray to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The provided program does not perform any such operations; it simply prints fixed outputs based on the length of the input array.
   - For any input where the length of the array is not 2, the program will print "13 0", which is incorrect because the maximum sum of the array can be greater than 13 for arrays of other lengths.

Given the above points, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem and thus is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations.
