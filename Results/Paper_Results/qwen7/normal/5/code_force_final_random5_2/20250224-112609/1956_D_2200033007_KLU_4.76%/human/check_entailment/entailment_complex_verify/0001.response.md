### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its behavior based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting a subarray from index \(l\) to \(r\) to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array.
   - The function `func_1` has hardcoded outputs for specific lengths of the array:
     - If \(n = 2\), it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
     - If \(n = 3\), it prints `13 0`.
     - For \(n > 3\), it prints `13 0`.

3. **Hardcoded Outputs**:
   - For \(n = 2\): Setting both elements to 2 maximizes the sum to 4, which is correct.
   - For \(n = 3\): No operations are needed because the initial sum is already maximized, which is correct.
   - For \(n > 3\): The program prints `13 0`, suggesting no operations are needed, but this is not necessarily correct. The problem states that for some cases with \(n > 3\), operations might be needed to maximize the sum.

4. **General Case Handling**:
   - The program does not provide a general strategy to determine the optimal sequence of operations for arrays of length greater than 3.
   - The hardcoded values do not account for the possibility that operations might be needed to maximize the sum for certain configurations of the array.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not solve the problem for all cases as specified. Specifically, the program does not provide a general strategy to maximize the sum for arrays of length greater than 3, and it uses hardcoded values that do not cover all possible scenarios.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all cases as required by the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
