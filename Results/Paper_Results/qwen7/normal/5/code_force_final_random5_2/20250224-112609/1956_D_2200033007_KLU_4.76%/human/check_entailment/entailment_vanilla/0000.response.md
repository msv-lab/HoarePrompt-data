Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in the array by performing operations up to 5 * 10^5 times.
2. The given code does not actually implement the logic to find the optimal sequence of operations to maximize the sum. Instead, it uses hardcoded values for different lengths of the array.
3. For `n = 2`, the code prints `4 1` and `1 2`. This suggests that for an array of length 2, setting all elements to 2 maximizes the sum, which is correct.
4. For `n = 3`, the code prints `13 0`. This suggests that no operations are needed, which is also correct since the initial sum is already the maximum possible.
5. For `n > 3`, the code prints `13 0`. However, the problem statement suggests that for some cases with `n > 3`, operations might be needed to maximize the sum.
6. The code does not handle the general case where `n > 3` correctly. It does not provide a strategy to maximize the sum for arrays of length greater than 3.

Given these points, the code does not solve the problem correctly for all cases as specified.

Correctness: **False**
