Output State: `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * k + c * a` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=k-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `k-1` (since the loop runs from `i=0` to `i=k-1`), `k` must still be greater than 0, and `s` will be the cumulative sum of the expression `c * i * c * k + c * a` for every value of `i` from `0` to `k-1`.
