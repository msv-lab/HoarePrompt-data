The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves integers n, m, and k, and a list of m tuples (a_i, b_i, f_i). It calculates and prints the value of `s`, which is computed using the formula `k * c * (k-1) * c * m + k * c * a`, where `c` is the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, and `a` is the sum of all `f_i` values from the input. The result is printed modulo `M`.
