Output State: **`i` is `k`, `m` is `k`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to int.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The variables `i` and `m` remain unchanged and are both equal to `k`.
