Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `s` to 0. The values of the other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
