Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is `m`
   - `k` is equal to `m`
   - `s` is `m * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(input())`. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `m + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`. It should be set to `m + 1`.

5. **Keep other variables unchanged**: The values of `k` and `s` do not depend on the loop head and thus remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `k` is equal to `m`, `s` is `m * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`**
