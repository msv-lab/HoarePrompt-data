Output State: **`i` is `k`, `c` is `(n * (n - 1) // 2) ** -1 % 10`, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * k + c * a` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=k-1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 10.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `c` using the formula `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`. This means `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M` (which is 10). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
