Output State: `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=k-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `k-1` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `k-1`. The variable `s` will be the cumulative sum of the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each value of `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
