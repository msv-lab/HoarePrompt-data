### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the given problem description and the annotated code.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
- It then processes `m` lines of input, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

#### Calculation of Combinations:
- The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children (`n * (n - 1) // 2`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`, which is correct.

#### Sum of Friendship Values:
- The variable `a` accumulates the sum of all friendship values `f_i` for the pairs of friends.
- This part is also correct.

#### Expected Value Calculation:
- The loop iterates `k` times, updating the sum `s` with the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
- This formula is incorrect. The correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion.

#### Modular Arithmetic:
- The final result `s % M` is printed, ensuring the result is within the required range.

### Correct Solution Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. The expected value for each pair of friends being chosen in any excursion is \(\frac{k}{\text{total pairs}}\), and the expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends over `k` excursions is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\).

The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values after `k` excursions is:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \times \text{friendship\_value}_i \right) \]

This can be simplified to:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \times \sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{friendship\_value}_i \]

Given that the program uses the incorrect formula `c * i * c * m + c * a`, it does not correctly compute the expected value.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The formula used in the program is incorrect and does not match the required solution.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
