Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, M is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The line `M = 10 ** 9 + 7` assigns the value 1000000007 (which is 10^9 + 7) to the variable `M`. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
