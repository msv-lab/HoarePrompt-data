Output State: **`i` is `m - 1`, `m` is `k`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged, with `i` being `m - 1` and `m` being `k`. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers entered by the user.
