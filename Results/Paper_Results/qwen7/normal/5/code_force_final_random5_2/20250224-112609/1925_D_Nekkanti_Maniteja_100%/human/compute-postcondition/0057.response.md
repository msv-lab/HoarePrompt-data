Output State: **`i` is `k`, `m` must be greater than 0, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split operation.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial states of `i` being `k` and `m` being greater than 0 remain unchanged. The new variables `u`, `v`, and `f` are assigned the integer values from the input.
