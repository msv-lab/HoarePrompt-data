Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Here's why:

1. **Friendship Value Increase Calculation**: The program calculates the increase in friendship values incorrectly. For each excursion, the friendship value of a chosen pair should increase by 1, but the current implementation does not properly account for this.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program attempts to use a combinatorial approach to calculate the expected value, but it does not correctly handle the probability of choosing each pair. Specifically, the line `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` is used to calculate the inverse of the total number of pairs, which is not necessary for the problem's requirements.

3. **Summation Logic**: The summation logic in the loop is incorrect. The expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. The key insight is that for each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value per excursion is the probability of choosing that pair.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Initialize the expected value
        expected_value = 0
        
        # Process each pair of friends
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            expected_value += f * min(u, v) * (n - max(u, v)) * k
        
        # Print the result modulo MOD
        print(expected_value % MOD)

func()
```

This approach correctly calculates the expected value by considering the probability of choosing each pair and the corresponding friendship value.
