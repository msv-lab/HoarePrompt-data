Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split operation, `a` remains unchanged, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `f` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `u`, `v`, and `f`. The values of `i`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
