Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it processes three integers n, f, and k, where 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a list a of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for all i in range(n). The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information, but it processes the input parameters and performs operations based on them.**
