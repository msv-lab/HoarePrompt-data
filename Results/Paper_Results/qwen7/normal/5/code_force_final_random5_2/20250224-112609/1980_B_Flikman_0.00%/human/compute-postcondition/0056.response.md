Output State: **`same_value_count` is 0, `greater_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `a[f - 1]`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `favorite_value` is now the element `a[f - 1]`**.

Explanation: The line `same_value_count = 0` sets the variable `same_value_count` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
