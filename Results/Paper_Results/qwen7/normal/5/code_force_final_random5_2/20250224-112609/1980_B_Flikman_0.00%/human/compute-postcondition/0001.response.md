Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the problem, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer input from the user.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, it will always be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` meets this condition.

Given the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
