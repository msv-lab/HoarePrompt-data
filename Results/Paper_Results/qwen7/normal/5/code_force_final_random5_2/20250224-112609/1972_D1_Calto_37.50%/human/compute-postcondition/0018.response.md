Output State: **The program returns the sum of x // y + 1 for each i from 1 to m-1, where x is n - (m * m - m), y is m * m, and n is equal to m.**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Given `m` is greater than 1.
2. `i` is set to `m`.
3. `x` is calculated as `n - (m * m - m)`. Since `n` is equal to `m`, `x` becomes `m - (m * m - m) = m - m^2 + m = 2m - m^2`.
4. `y` is calculated as `m * m`.
5. `cnt` is the sum of `x // y + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`. Since `i` is set to `m`, it doesn't change the loop range, and `cnt` is the sum of `x // y + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`.

Therefore, the program returns the sum of `x // y + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, where `x` is `2m - m^2` and `y` is `m^2`.
