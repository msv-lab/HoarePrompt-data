Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)'; `y` is `i * i`.**

Explanation: The code `y = i * i` assigns the value of `i * i` to the variable `y`. The values of `m` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `m` must still be greater than 1, and `x` is still defined as `n - (i * i - i)`. The new variable `y` is now equal to `i * i`.
