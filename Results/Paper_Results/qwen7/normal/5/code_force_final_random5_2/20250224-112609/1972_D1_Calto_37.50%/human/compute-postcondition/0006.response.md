Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`, `cnt` is `cnt + (n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) // ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) + ((i + 1) > 1)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `n - (i * i - i)`. The other variables (`m`, `y`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated value of `x` is derived from the new formula, while the rest of the variables retain their original conditions and values.
