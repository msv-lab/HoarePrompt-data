You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, both positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It calculates the sum of `x // y + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, where `x` is `n - (m * m - m)` and `y` is `m * m`. If this sum equals 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated sum.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The implementation is correct and efficient.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is intended to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) with the condition that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Let's break down the logic inside `func_2`:
     ```python
     def func_2(n, m):
         cnt = 0
         for i in range(1, m):
             x = n - (i * i - i)
             y = i * i
             cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
         if cnt == 0:
             return 1
         return cnt
     ```

     - The loop iterates over values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
     - For each \(b\), it computes \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
     - It then increments the count `cnt` by `x // y + (i > 1)`.
     - Finally, it returns `cnt`.

### Issues in the Function `func_2`

- **Incorrect Calculation**: The calculation of `x` and `y` does not align with the problem statement. Specifically, \(x\) and \(y\) do not represent any meaningful values related to the problem constraints.
- **Logic Mismatch**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion

The given function `func_2` is incorrect because it does not follow the problem's requirements. Therefore, the provided program is not correct.

**Correctness: **False**
