Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`. It is used correctly within the main logic of the program to compute the GCD of `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: The annotated explanation of `func_2` does not match the actual implementation. The function should calculate the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the current implementation does not follow this logic. Instead, it calculates something related to the difference between `n` and a quadratic expression involving `i`, and sums these differences divided by another quadratic expression. This does not align with the problem statement.

Given the discrepancy between the intended logic and the actual implementation, the provided code does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
