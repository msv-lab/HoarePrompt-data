Output State: `m` must be greater than 1; `i` is equal to `m`; `x` is `n - (m * m - m)`, `y` is `m * m`; `cnt` is the sum of `x // y + (m > 1)` added for each iteration from `i` starting from 1 up to `m-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `m` will be the final value it was set to, `i` will be equal to `m`, `x` will be calculated as `n - (m * m - m)`, `y` will be `m * m`, and `cnt` will be the cumulative sum of `x // y + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`.
