Output State: `m` must be greater than 1; `i` is equal to `m`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`; `cnt` is the sum of `x // y + (i > 1)` for each iteration from `i = 1` to `i = m`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `m`. The value of `x` will be `n - (m * m - m)`, and `y` will be `m * m`. The variable `cnt` will hold the cumulative sum of `x // y + (i > 1)` for each iteration from `i = 1` to `i = m`.
