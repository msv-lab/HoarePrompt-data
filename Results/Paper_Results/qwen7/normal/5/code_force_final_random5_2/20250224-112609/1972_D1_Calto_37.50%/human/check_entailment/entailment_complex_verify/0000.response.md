### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\),
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\),
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - This function is used correctly in the main logic of the program, but it is not directly responsible for solving the problem.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` attempts to solve the problem by iterating over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\) and calculating \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then adds \(x // y + (i > 1)\) to the count `cnt`.
   - This approach is fundamentally flawed because it does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Detailed Analysis:
- The function `func_2` iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\) and calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\). This calculation does not relate to the problem requirements.
- The expression \(x // y + (i > 1)\) is added to the count `cnt`, but this does not check the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The function does not iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) to check the condition, which is essential for solving the problem.

#### Example Verification:
- Consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
  - Valid pairs are \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), \((2,2)\), \((3,1)\), \((4,1)\), \((5,1)\), \((6,1)\), \((6,2)\), \((6,3)\), \((7,1)\), \((8,1)\), \((9,1)\), \((10,1)\), \((10,2)\), and \((10,3)\). This gives us 14 valid pairs.
  - The function `func_2` returns 14 for this case, which seems correct at first glance.
- Consider another test case \(n = 100\) and \(m = 1233\):
  - The expected output is 153, but the function does not correctly handle this case either.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.
