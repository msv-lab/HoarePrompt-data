Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: The function `func_1` is intended to handle the movement of entities on the field. It takes a position `(x, y)` and a direction `(dx, dy)` and returns the new position `(x + dx, y + dy)`. However, the provided implementation of `func_1` has a logical error. Instead of returning a tuple with the updated coordinates, it incorrectly returns a tuple with the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the position and the direction. This will result in incorrect movement calculations.

2. **Movement Logic**: The movement logic in the main program uses `func_1` to update the positions of players and the Quaffle. Since `func_1` is incorrect, the movements of the players and the Quaffle will not be calculated correctly, leading to incorrect game states and outcomes.

3. **Entity Interactions**: The program correctly handles interactions such as catching the Quaffle, throwing the Quaffle, and eliminating players when they collide with Bludgers. However, these interactions depend on accurate positions, which are not being calculated correctly due to the error in `func_1`.

4. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is implemented correctly, but it relies on the correct positions of players and the Quaffle. Since the positions are incorrect, the scoring will also be incorrect.

Given these points, the program is fundamentally flawed due to the incorrect implementation of the movement function `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**
