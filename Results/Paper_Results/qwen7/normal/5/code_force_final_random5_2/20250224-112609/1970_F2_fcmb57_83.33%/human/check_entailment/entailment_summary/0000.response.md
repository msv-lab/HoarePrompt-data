Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: The provided function `func_1` is incorrect for the problem's requirements. The function should take a position `(x, y)` and a direction `(dx, dy)` and return a new position after moving in the specified direction. However, the function instead takes a list of strings and an integer, which is not relevant to the problem. This function should be corrected to properly handle the movement logic.

2. **Player Movement Handling**: The program correctly updates the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the movements specified. However, the function `func_1` used for movement is incorrect and should be replaced with a proper movement function.

3. **Bludger and Elimination Logic**: The program correctly handles the elimination of players when they collide with a Bludger. However, the function `func_1` used for this purpose is incorrect and should be replaced with a proper movement function.

4. **Scoring Logic**: The program correctly handles scoring when a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal. The score is updated and the appropriate message is printed.

5. **Final Score Output**: The program correctly outputs the final score at the end of the game.

Given these points, the core issue lies in the incorrect implementation of the movement function `func_1`. Since the rest of the logic appears to be correct, we need to replace `func_1` with a proper movement function.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, replace the function `func_1` with the following correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended.
