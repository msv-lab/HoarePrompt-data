Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to check if a password meets the specified conditions:
   - No digit comes after a letter.
   - All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. The function splits the password into digits and letters, then checks the conditions sequentially.
4. The logic in the function is sound:
   - It iterates through the password to ensure no digit comes after a letter.
   - It sorts and compares the digits and letters to ensure they are in the required order.
5. The function returns 'YES' if all conditions are met and 'NO' otherwise.
6. The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem description and the provided example outputs.

Correctness: **True**
