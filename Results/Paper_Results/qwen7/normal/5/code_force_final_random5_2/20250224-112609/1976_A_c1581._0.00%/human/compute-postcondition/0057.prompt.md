You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `password` is an empty string, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password`.
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: The loop will have executed for as many times as there are characters in the password. After all iterations, `last_digit_index` will either be the index of the last digit in the password (if any digits exist), or -1 if no digits are found. The value of `i` will be equal to the length of the password. The function will return 'NO' if a non-digit character is encountered after `last_digit_index` has been set to a positive value.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The loop will have executed for as many times as there are characters in the password. After all iterations, `last_digit_index` will either be the index of the last digit in the password (if any digits exist), or -1 if no digits are found. The value of `i` will be equal to the length of the password. If `last_digit_index` is set to a positive value, a non-digit character is encountered after `last_digit_index`. The function returns 'NO'.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The loop will have executed for as many times as there are characters in the password. After all iterations, `last_digit_index` will either be the index of the last digit in the password (if any digits exist), or -1 if no digits are found. The value of `i` will be equal to the length of the password. If `last_digit_index` is set to a positive value, a non-digit character is encountered after `last_digit_index`. The function returns 'YES', and the list `letters` is sorted.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `password`, which is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function returns 'YES' under certain conditions and 'NO' otherwise.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'NO'

Case_4: The program returns 'NO'

Case_5: The program returns 'NO'

Case_6: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
