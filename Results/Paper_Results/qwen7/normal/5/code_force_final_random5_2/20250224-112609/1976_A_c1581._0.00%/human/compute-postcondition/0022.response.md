Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head:
   - The loop head is `for (i, char) in enumerate(password):`
   - The objects involved are `i`, `char`, and `password`.

2. Determine the initial state of these objects:
   - `last_digit_index` is -1.
   - `password` is an empty string.
   - `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password`.
   - `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password`.

3. Analyze the condition for the loop to execute:
   - The loop will execute if `password` is not an empty string because `enumerate(password)` will generate pairs of indices and characters as long as there are elements in `password`.

4. Adjust the states of the objects in the loop head:
   - Since the loop depends on `password` having at least one character, we need to ensure `password` is not empty.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0, and `char` will be the first character of `password`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `password` must not be an empty string.
- `i` will be 0.
- `char` will be the first character of `password`.

State: **`last_digit_index` is -1, `password` must not be an empty string, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `password`**
