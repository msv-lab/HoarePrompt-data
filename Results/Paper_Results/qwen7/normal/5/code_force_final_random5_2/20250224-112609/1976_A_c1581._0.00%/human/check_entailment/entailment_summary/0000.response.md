Reasoning:
The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each password according to the specified rules, and outputs whether each password is strong or not. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the password meets the required conditions:

1. **Digits in Non-Decreasing Order**: The program collects all digits into a list and checks if this list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. **Letters in Alphabetical Order**: Similarly, the program collects all letters into a list and checks if this list is sorted alphabetically.
3. **No Digit After Letter**: The program ensures that there are no digits appearing after any letter in the password by iterating through the password and checking the index of the last digit. If a letter appears after a digit, it immediately returns 'NO'.

Given the execution summary and the function implementation, the program logic aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
