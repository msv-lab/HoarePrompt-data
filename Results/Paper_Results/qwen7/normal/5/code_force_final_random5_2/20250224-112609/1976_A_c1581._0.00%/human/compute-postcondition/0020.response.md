Output State: **After all iterations, `password` is an empty string, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password`.**

Explanation: The loop processes each character in the `password` string exactly once. For each character, it checks whether the character is a digit or a letter and appends it to the respective list (`digits` or `letters`). By the end of the loop, all characters from the original `password` have been processed, so `password` becomes an empty string. The `digits` list will contain all the digits from the original `password`, and the `letters` list will contain all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password`.
