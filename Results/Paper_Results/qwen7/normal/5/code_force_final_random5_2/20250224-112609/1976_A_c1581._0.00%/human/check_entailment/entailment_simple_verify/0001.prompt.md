You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

import sys

input = sys.stdin.read

t = int(data[0])
index = 1

    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list called `data`.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary information for each case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the password (`n`) and the password itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to check if the password meets the criteria.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks two main conditions:
     1. **Digits and Letters Separation**:
        - It separates digits and letters into two lists.
        - It ensures that there are no digits coming after a letter by checking the indices where digits appear.
     - **Sorting Conditions**:
        - It checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The code correctly reads all input at once and processes it in chunks for each test case.
   - This part is correct and handles multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The extraction of `n` and `password` is correct.
   - The call to `func_1` is also correct.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Digits and Letters Separation**:
     - The logic for separating digits and letters is correct.
     - The check for no digits after a letter is implemented by ensuring that the last digit index is before any letter.
   - **Sorting Conditions**:
     - The check for sorted digits and letters is done using the `sorted()` function, which is correct.

### Edge Cases and Special Considerations

- **Empty Password**: The code does not handle empty passwords explicitly, but since the problem constraints state \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), an empty password is not possible.
- **Single Character Passwords**: The code will handle these correctly as it checks both digits and letters separately.
- **Mixed Passwords**: The code correctly handles mixed passwords by ensuring that digits come before letters and that both groups are sorted.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, we can confirm that it correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.
