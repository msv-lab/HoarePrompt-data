Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - Postcondition: If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 2.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Determine the new value of `mid`**:
   - `mid` remains unchanged within the loop as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - Therefore, `mid` will still be `n // 2`.

5. **Adjust the postconditions**:
   - The postcondition checks if `s[i]` is '0' or '1'.
   - Since `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration, the postcondition needs to be updated based on the value of `s[1]`.
   - If `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` will be 2. Otherwise, `leftOne` will be 2.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, if `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 2.**
