Postcondition: **`right` equals `n`, `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros encountered during the loop, `tleftOne` is the total count of ones encountered during the loop, `left` is 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are both 0. If `right` is not equal to `n`, then either `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or the condition `(rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2)` is false. If `left` is 0, and `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. If the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, then `right` is incremented by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the possible outcomes of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts, and the conditions under which each outcome occurs.
