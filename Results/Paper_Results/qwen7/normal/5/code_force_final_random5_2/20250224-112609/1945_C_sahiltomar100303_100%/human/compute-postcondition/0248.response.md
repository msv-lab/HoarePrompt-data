Output State: **`left` is equal to either `mid - 3` or `mid - 4`, `leftZero` must be less than `(mid - 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left - 1] == '0'`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 3) // 2`, and at least one of `leftZero < (mid - 1 + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - mid + 1 + 1) // 2` must hold true.**

Explanation: The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was initially equal to either `mid - 2` or `mid - 3`, after decrementing, it will now be equal to either `mid - 3` or `mid - 4`. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
