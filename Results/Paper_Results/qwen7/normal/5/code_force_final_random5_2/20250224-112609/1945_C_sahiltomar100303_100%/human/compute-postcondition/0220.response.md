Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid`, `rightZero` reflects the count of '0's in the substring from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `rightOne` reflects the count of '1's in the same substring**.

Explanation: The code `left = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `left`. It does not affect the values of `rightZero` or `rightOne`. Therefore, after executing this line of code, `left` will be equal to `mid`, while `rightZero` and `rightOne` retain their counts from the previous state.
