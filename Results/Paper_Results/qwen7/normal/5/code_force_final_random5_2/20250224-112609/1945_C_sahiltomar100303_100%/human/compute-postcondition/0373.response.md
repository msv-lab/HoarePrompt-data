Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `rightOne` is updated to `rightOne + 2`**

Explanation: The variable `trightOne` is assigned the value of itself plus 1, which means `rightOne` is incremented by 1. Since `rightOne` was initially updated to `rightOne + 1`, after this line of code, `rightOne` will be `rightOne + 2`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
