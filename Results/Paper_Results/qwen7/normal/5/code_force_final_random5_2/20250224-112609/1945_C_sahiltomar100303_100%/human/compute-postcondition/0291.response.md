Postcondition: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - right`, `trightOne` is equal to `trightOne - (n - right)`, and the condition `left == 0` is true, and `right != n`.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2` is true or false, the values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `right`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain consistent with the given constraints. Specifically, `left` remains 0, `leftZero` stays as either 0 or 1, and the counts of '0's and '1's in the specified substring do not change, while `trightZero` and `trightOne` adjust according to the value of `right`.
