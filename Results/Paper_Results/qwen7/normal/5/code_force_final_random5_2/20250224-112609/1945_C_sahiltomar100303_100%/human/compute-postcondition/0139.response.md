Based on the initial state provided:

- `right` equals `n`
- `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros encountered during the loop
- `tleftOne` is the total count of ones encountered during the loop
- `left` is 0
- `trightZero` and `trightOne` are both 0
- The current value of `left` is not 0 (this seems contradictory with the previous statement that `left` is 0, but we will consider the last statement as it directly gives the current value).

The `print(left)` statement will print the current value of the variable `left`, which is explicitly stated to be not 0.

Output: **0**
