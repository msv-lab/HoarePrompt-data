Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is an integer, `leftZero` is `left - 1`, and the character at position `leftZero` in `s` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Initially, `leftZero` was equal to `left - 1`. After decrementing `leftZero` by 1, `leftZero` now equals `left - 2`. The character at position `leftZero` in `s` remains '0' as no other changes were made to the string `s`.
