Output State: **`left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` is 1, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `leftMove` remains unchanged, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid`, `trightZero` is decreased by 1, `trightOne` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `s[right]` is '0', and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

The code `trightZero -= 1` decreases the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
