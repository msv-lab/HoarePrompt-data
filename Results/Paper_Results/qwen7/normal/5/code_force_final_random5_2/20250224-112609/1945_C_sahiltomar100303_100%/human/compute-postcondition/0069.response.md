Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is an integer, `leftZero` is `left - 1`, and `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `s` remains a string, `left` remains an integer, `leftZero` remains `left - 1`, and `rightZero` is increased by 1.
