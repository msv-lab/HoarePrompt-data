Output State: All iterations of the loop have completed, resulting in the following conditions:

- The variable `left` is now 0 because it is decremented until it reaches 0.
- The variable `leftZero` is the total number of zeros in the substring from `mid` to the original `n-1`, as it is decremented each time a zero is encountered.
- The variable `leftOne` is the total number of ones in the substring from `mid` to the original `n-1`, as it is decremented each time a one is encountered.
- The variable `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the substring from `left` (which is now 0) to `n-1`, which is effectively the total number of zeros in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`.
- The variable `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the substring from `left` (which is now 0) to `n-1`, which is effectively the total number of ones in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`.
- The variable `tleftZero` is the cumulative count of zeros seen throughout the loop, which is the same as `leftZero` since no new zeros are added once `left` reaches 0.
- The variable `tleftOne` is the cumulative count of ones seen throughout the loop, which is the same as `leftOne` since no new ones are added once `left` reaches 0.
- The variable `trightZero` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of zeros in the entire string `s`.
- The variable `trightOne` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of ones in the entire string `s`.
- The variable `trightZero` is the total number of zeros in the entire string `s`.
- The variable `trightOne` is the total number of ones in the entire string `s`.
- The variable `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`.
- The variable `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`.
- The variable `left` is now 0.
- The variable `leftZero` is the total number of zeros in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`.
- The variable `leftOne` is the total number of ones in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`.

In summary, after all iterations of the loop, `left` will be 0, and `leftZero` and `leftOne` will represent the counts of zeros and ones respectively in the substring from `mid` to `n-1` of the string `s`.
