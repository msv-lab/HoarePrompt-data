Postcondition: `right` equals `n`, `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros encountered during the loop, `tleftOne` is the total count of ones encountered during the loop, `left` is 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are both 0. If `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, the condition `tleftZero < (n + 1) // 2` is true.
