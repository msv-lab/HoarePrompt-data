Postcondition: `left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` is adjusted based on whether `s[left - 1]` is '0' or not, and `rightOne` and `rightZero` are updated accordingly. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftZero` becomes `(left + 1) // 2 - 1`, and `rightZero` is increased by 1. If `s[left - 1]` is not '0', `leftZero` remains less than \((left + 1) // 2\), `rightOne` is increased by 1, and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.
