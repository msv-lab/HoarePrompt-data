Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid`. The variable `rightZero` will be equal to the total number of zeros in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, and `trightZero` will also be equal to the total number of zeros in the entire string `s`. Similarly, `rightOne` will be equal to the total number of ones in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, and `trightOne` will be equal to the total number of ones in the entire string `s`. `tleftZero` will be the cumulative count of zeros seen throughout the loop, and `tleftOne` will be the cumulative count of ones seen throughout the loop.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` will have reached the end of the string (`n`), confirming that the loop has processed every element from `mid` to the end of the string. The counts of zeros and ones (`rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`) will reflect the totals within the specified substring and the entire string, respectively. The cumulative counts of zeros and ones seen throughout the loop (`tleftZero`, `tleftOne`) will also be updated accordingly.
