Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid - 3` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than `(mid - 1) // 2`, `rightZero` must be less than `(n - mid + 3) // 2`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 3) // 2`, and at least one of `leftZero < (mid - 1 + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - mid + 1 + 1) // 2` must hold true; `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `rightOne`.
