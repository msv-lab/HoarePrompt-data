Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0**

The code initializes `tleftZero` to 0. The initial values of `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `tleftZero` and retains the original values of the other variables.
