Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2` or greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - right`, `trightOne` is equal to `trightOne - (n - right)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `mid` is `n // 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is assigned the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
