Output State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `rightOne` is increased by 2**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` was already increased by 1 in the initial state. The code `trightOne += 1` increases `rightOne` by another 1, making it increased by a total of 2 from its original value. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
