Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `right` equals `n + 1`, `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `left` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `s` is an input string, `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` is assigned the value 0. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
