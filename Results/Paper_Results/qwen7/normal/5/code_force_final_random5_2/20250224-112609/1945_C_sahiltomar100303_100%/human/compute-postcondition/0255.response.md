Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is 1 (since `tleftZero += 1` increments `tleftZero` by 1), `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is `mid`, `tleftZero` is 1 (since it was less than `(mid + 1) // 2` and now incremented by 1), and `trightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`. The current value of `s[right]` is '0'.**

This output state reflects that `tleftZero` has been incremented by 1, making it 1, while all other conditions and values remain unchanged as per the initial state.
