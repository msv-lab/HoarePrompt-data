Output State: **`right` must be less than `n` and `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2`; `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `trightOne` is decreased by 1. The conditions involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain unchanged because the code only modifies `trightOne`. Therefore, the conditions `right < n` and the inequalities involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` still hold true.
