Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to 0, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, and `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `right = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. This does not affect the values of `left`, `leftZero`, or `rightOne`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state, except that `right` is now set to `mid`.
