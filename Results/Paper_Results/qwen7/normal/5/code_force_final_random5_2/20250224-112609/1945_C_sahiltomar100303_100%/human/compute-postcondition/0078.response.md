Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` is (leftZero + 1), `rightOne` is less than (n - left + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
