Output State: **`right` is equal to `right` + 1, `tleftZero` is equal to its previous value plus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `trightOne` is decreased by 1, `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right]` is '0', and `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` still holds.**

Explanation: The line `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. The conditions for updating `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, and `trightZero` remain the same, depending on whether `s[right]` is '0' or not. The condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` also remains valid as no other variables have been altered in a way that would affect this condition.
