Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` must be greater than 1, if `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 4, otherwise `leftOne` is 4**

Explanation: The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Since the initial state of `leftZero` is 3 (if `s[1]` is '0') or `leftOne` is 3 (otherwise), after incrementing, `leftZero` becomes 4 (if `s[1]` is '0') or `leftOne` becomes 4 (otherwise). The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
