Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2` or greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - right`, `trightOne` is equal to `trightOne - (n - right)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
