Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is decremented by 1, `leftZero` is decremented by 1, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - (left + 1)) // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1.**

The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
