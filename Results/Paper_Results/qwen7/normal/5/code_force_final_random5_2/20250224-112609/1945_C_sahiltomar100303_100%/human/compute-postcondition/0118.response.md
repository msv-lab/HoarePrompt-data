Output State: **`right` must be less than `n`, and `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` must still hold; `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `right` remains the same as it was in the initial state, meaning it is still less than `n`. The condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` also still holds true. Additionally, `trightOne` is decreased by 1 from its previous value.
