Output State: **`right` must be less than `n` and `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2`; `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. The conditions involving `right`, `n`, `tleftZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `tleftOne` while preserving the original conditions related to `right`, `n`, `tleftZero`, and `trightOne`.
