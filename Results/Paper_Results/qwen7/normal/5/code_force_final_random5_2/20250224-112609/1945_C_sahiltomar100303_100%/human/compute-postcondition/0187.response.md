Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1 if it was 0, or 0 if it was 1.
- `mid` is `n // 2`.
- `leftZero` is 4 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 4.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(mid):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` ranging from 0 to `mid - 1`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 in the first iteration, it will increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, if `i` was 0 in the previous iteration, it will now be 1.
   - If `i` was 1 in the previous iteration, it will now be 0.

2. **Variable `mid`:**
   - `mid` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `mid` is defined as `n // 2`.

3. **Variables `leftZero` and `leftOne`:**
   - These variables are not directly modified in the loop head.
   - Their values depend on the condition `s[i]` being '0' or '1'.
   - They remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, these values stay the same.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that changes based on the loop head is `i`.
- Given the postcondition, `i` will be 1 if it was 0, or 0 if it was 1.
- `mid` and the values of `leftZero` and `leftOne` remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1 if it was 0, or 0 if it was 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `leftZero` is 4 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 4.**

This ensures that the loop can proceed correctly based on the updated value of `i`.
