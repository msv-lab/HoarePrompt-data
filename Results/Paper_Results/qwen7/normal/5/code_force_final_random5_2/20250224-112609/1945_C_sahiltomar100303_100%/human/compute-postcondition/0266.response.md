Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` must be less than `n`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(mid + 2) // 2`, `trightZero` is either equal to `trightZero - 1` or remains the same, and `trightOne` must be less than `(n - mid) // 2; `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
