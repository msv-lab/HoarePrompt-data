Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `rightZero` is updated to `rightZero + 1`, `trightZero` is `rightZero + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is incremented by 1, making it equal to `rightZero + 1`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
