Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop variable. This means the loop will run `t` times.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variable**: Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any specific value, the loop will simply iterate `t` times. There is no need to adjust the state of `_` because it is not used within the loop body (which is omitted).

3. **Consider the state of other variables**: The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are defined outside the loop. However, these variables are not directly involved in the loop itself; they are used inside the loop body, which is omitted. Therefore, we do not need to adjust their states for the loop to execute.

4. **Ensure the loop condition is met**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Given the initial state where `t` is an input integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute since `t` is guaranteed to be positive.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be considered is `t`, but since it is already given as a valid input, no adjustment is needed.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an input integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**
