Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 2, `leftZero` is 5, `leftOne` is 4, `tleftOne` is 2**

The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially 4, after the increment, its new value is 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
