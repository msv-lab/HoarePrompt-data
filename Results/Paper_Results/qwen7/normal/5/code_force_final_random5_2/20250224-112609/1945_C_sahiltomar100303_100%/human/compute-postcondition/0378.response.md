Output State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `rightZero` is increased by 2**

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` was already increased by 1 in the initial state. The code `trightZero += 1` increments `rightZero` by 1 again. Therefore, `rightZero` is now increased by 2. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `mid + 2`.
