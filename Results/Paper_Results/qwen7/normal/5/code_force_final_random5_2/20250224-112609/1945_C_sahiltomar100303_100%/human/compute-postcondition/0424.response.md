Output State: **`left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid`, `trightZero` remains unchanged, `trightOne` is decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and either `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` must hold true.**

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition involving `trightOne` still holds true as per the initial precondition.
