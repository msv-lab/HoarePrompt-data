Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid - 1` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is either equal to `leftZero - 1` and still less than half of `left + 1`, or remains less than half of `left + 1`, `rightZero` is either equal to `rightZero + 1` and still less than half of `n - left + 1`, or remains less than half of `n - left + 1`, and `rightOne` is either increased by 1 or remains less than half of `n - left + 1`.**

This means that `left` has been decremented by 1, making it `mid - 1`. All other conditions and relationships involving `leftZero`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged from the initial state.
