Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is equal to `trightOne - (n - right)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `mid` is `n // 2**.

Explanation: The line `trightZero = 0` sets the value of `trightZero` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
