Output State: `right` equals `n`, `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros encountered during the loop, `tleftOne` is the total count of ones encountered during the loop, `left` is 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are both 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the condition `right < n` will no longer be satisfied because `right` will have incremented to `n`. The loop updates `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` based on the characters it encounters, and since `trightZero` and `trightOne` are only updated within the loop and then reset to 0 when the loop exits, their final values will be 0. The `left` variable is set to 0 once the loop exits, indicating that the left boundary has reached the start of the string.
