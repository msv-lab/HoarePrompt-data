Output State: **`right` is less than `n - 1`, `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `trightZero` is decreased by 1, and `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` must still hold.**

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` must still hold true as per the initial state.
