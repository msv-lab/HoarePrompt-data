Output State: **`left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `leftOne` is increased by 1, `leftMove` remains unchanged, `right` is `right + 1`, `trightZero` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `trightOne` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

The code `tleftOne += 1` increases the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Since `tleftOne` was either unchanged or increased by 1 before the code, it is now increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the initial state must still hold true.
