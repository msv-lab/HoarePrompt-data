Output State: **`left` is greater than 0; `leftZero` is now `(left + 1) // 2 - 1`; `rightOne` must be less than \((n - left + 1) // 2\); the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Since `leftZero` must be less than \((left + 1) // 2\), after decrementing, it becomes \((left + 1) // 2 - 1\). The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
