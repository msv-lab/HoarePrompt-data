Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`t`), followed by the number of cards (`n`) and the integer `k` for each test case. It also reads the list of card numbers (`nums`).

2. **Edge Case Handling**: For the edge case where `k > n`, the program correctly prints `n` because no exchanges can be made, and thus the number of cards remains unchanged.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each number in the list and ensures that no number appears more than `k` times. This is done correctly by setting the frequency to `k` if it exceeds `k`.

4. **Output Determination**: After calling `func_1`, the program checks if `k` is present in the values of the returned dictionary. If `k` is present, it prints `k - 1` because we can reduce the count of `k` to `k - 1` through the allowed operations. Otherwise, it prints `n` because no further reduction is possible.

5. **Logic Flow**: The logic flow is correct and matches the problem statement. The program correctly identifies the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the allowed operations.

Given the above points, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly.

Correctness: **True**
