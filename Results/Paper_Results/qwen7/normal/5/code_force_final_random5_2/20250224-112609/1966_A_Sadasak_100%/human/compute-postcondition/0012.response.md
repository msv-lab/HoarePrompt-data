Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers starting from the third element, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the key `num` having a value of 1 more than its previous count.**

Explanation: The code updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the key `num` by 1. Since `num` is the third element of `arr`, the dictionary `frequency_table` now has the key `num` with its value incremented by 1 from its previous count. All other variables remain unchanged.
