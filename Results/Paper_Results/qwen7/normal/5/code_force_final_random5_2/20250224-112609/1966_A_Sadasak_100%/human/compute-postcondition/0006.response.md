Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary. If the value of `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then the value of `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change in `frequency_table` regarding `num` since there is no else part provided.**
