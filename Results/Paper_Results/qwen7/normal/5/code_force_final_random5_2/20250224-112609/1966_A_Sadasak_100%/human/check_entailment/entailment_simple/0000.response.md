Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the specified operations.
2. The provided program reads the input and processes each test case separately.
3. For each test case, it checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If true, it prints `n` because no operations can be performed.
4. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to get the frequency table of card numbers that appear more than `k` times, capping their counts at `k`.
5. It then checks if `k` appears in the values of the frequency table. If true, it prints `k - 1` because we can reduce the count of `k` to `k - 1` using the operation. Otherwise, it prints `n`, indicating no further reduction is possible.

However, the provided function `func_1` does not directly contribute to solving the problem as described. Instead, it simply caps the frequencies of numbers appearing more than `k` times, which is not necessary for determining the minimum number of cards. The logic in the main program should focus on counting the unique numbers and ensuring the count is reduced optimally.

Given this analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The function `func_1` is not used appropriately, and the logic for determining the minimum number of cards is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
