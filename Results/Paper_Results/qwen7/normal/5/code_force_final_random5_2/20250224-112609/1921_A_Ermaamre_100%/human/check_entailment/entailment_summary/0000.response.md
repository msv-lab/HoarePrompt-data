Reasoning:
The provided program correctly identifies the side length of the square by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or equivalently, the maximum and minimum y-coordinates) of the given points. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates will give the side length of the square. Squaring this difference gives the area of the square.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program processes each set of coordinates correctly and prints the area of the square for each set. There is no indication of any logical errors or issues with the program's logic as described.

Correctness: **True**
