Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `a` is a 4x4 matrix of integers, `x` is now a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`, `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `dx` the value of the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the list `x`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
