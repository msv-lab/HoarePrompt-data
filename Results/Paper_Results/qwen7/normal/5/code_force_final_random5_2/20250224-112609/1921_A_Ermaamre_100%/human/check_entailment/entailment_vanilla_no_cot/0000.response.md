Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the area of the square. Here's why:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners and stores them in a list `a`.
3. It extracts the x-coordinates into a list `x`.
4. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`), which gives the side length of the square.
5. Finally, it prints the square of this difference, which is the area of the square.

Given that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in the x-coordinates will be equal to the difference in the y-coordinates, and both will give the side length of the square. Thus, the program correctly computes the area.
