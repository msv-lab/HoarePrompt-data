### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output:**
   - The program needs to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - It is guaranteed that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and have a positive area.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - `t = int(input())`: This reads the number of test cases.
   - `for _ in range(t)`: This loop runs for each test case.
   - `a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]`: This reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square into a list of lists `a`.
   - `x = [p[0] for p in a]`: This extracts the x-coordinates of the points into a list `x`.
   - `dx = max(x) - min(x)`: This calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which gives the side length of the square.
   - `print(dx * dx)`: This prints the area of the square, which is the side length squared.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic for calculating the side length of the square is correct because the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - However, the code assumes that the maximum and minimum x-coordinates correspond to the opposite corners of the square. This is not always true. The x-coordinates alone do not guarantee that they represent the full width of the square.

4. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     1
     1 2
     4 5
     1 5
     4 2
     ```
   - The coordinates provided form a square with side length 3 (distance between (1,2) and (4,2) or (1,5) and (4,5)).
   - The code extracts the x-coordinates `[1, 4, 1, 4]` and calculates `max(x) - min(x) = 4 - 1 = 3`, which is the correct side length.
   - However, if the input were:
     ```
     1
     1 2
     4 5
     1 5
     2 4
     ```
   - The coordinates still form a square with side length 3, but the x-coordinates extracted would be `[1, 4, 1, 2]`, and `max(x) - min(x) = 4 - 1 = 3`. This is correct in this case as well.
   - But consider:
     ```
     1
     1 2
     4 5
     2 1
     5 4
     ```
   - Here, the coordinates still form a square with side length 3, but the x-coordinates extracted would be `[1, 4, 2, 5]`, and `max(x) - min(x) = 5 - 1 = 4`, which is incorrect.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The code only considers the x-coordinates to determine the side length, which is insufficient to ensure the correct side length is always extracted. The y-coordinates should also be considered to ensure the correct side length is determined.
