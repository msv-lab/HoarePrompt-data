Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` itself is not used in the print statement).
- `a` is a 4x4 matrix of integers.
- `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`.
- `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression `dx * dx`:

1. `x` is a list with four elements, each being the first element from one of the rows in the 4x4 matrix `a`.
2. `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in this list `x`.

The expression `dx * dx` will square the value of `dx`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `dx`. However, we know it is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the square of `dx`.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x)**
