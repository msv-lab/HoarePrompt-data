Output State: The value of `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a 4x4 matrix of integers entered by the user for each iteration, `x` is a list of the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a` for each iteration, and `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x` for each iteration. The final output will be the result of `dx * dx` printed for each of the `t` iterations, concatenated together if `t` is greater than 1.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will consist of `t` lines, each line displaying the result of `dx * dx` for that particular iteration.
