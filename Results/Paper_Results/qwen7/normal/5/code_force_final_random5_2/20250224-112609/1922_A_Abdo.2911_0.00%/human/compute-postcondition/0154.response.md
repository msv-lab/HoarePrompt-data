Output State: **`match_a_b` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either a lowercase letter where neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` matches it, or it is not a lowercase letter where either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches it when converted to lowercase. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `match_a_b`, `i`, `n`, or the character at index `i` in `template`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block where this statement is placed.
