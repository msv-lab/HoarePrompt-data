Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.**

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most nested block it is inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block (like an `if` statement) that the `break` statement is directly inside, it implies that the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `match_a_b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
