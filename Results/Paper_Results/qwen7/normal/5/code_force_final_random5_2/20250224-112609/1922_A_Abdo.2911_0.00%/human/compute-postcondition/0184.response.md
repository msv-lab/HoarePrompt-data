Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `match_c` is True
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - The current character in `template` at index `i` is either a lowercase character where it matches `c[i]` or it is not a lowercase character.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will continue if `i < n`.
   - After the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `match_c` remains unchanged as True.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`match_c` is True, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
