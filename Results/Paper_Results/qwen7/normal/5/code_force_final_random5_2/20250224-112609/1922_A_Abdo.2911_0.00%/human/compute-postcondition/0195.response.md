Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `match_c` is True
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body Behavior:**
   - If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_c` becomes False.
   - If `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, we break out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, `match_c` remains True and `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (this condition does not change within the loop).

5. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` will increment to 2).

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`match_c` is True, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
