Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input value, `b` is the stripped input value**.

Explanation: The code assigns the stripped input value to `b`. Since `a` was already defined as the stripped input value, `b` now holds the same value as `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was an input integer before.
