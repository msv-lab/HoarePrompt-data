Postcondition: `match_c` is True, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_c` becomes False. If `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `match_c` remains True and `i` is still 1, `n` must still be greater than 1.
