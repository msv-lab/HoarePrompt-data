Postcondition: `match_c` is either `True` or `False`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` is set to `False` and `i` is 1, indicating we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` equals `template[i]`, then no change is made to `match_c` and `i` remains unchanged while still being less than `n`.
