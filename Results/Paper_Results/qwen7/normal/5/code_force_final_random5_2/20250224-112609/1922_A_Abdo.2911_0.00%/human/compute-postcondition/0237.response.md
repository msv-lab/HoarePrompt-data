Output State: **`match_a_b` is `True`**.

Explanation: The given code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `match_a_b`. Since no other operations are performed on `match_a_b` or any other variables, the only change is that `match_a_b` is set to `True`. All other preconditions remain unchanged.
