Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `template` is a list. If the element at index 1 of list `a` is equal to the element at index 1 of list `b`, then `template` contains the element at index 1 of list `a` twice. Otherwise, `template` contains the uppercase version of the element at index 1 of list `a` once.
