Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 1 or incremented such that it is still less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code sets `match_c` to `False`, regardless of its initial value (which was either `True` or `False`). The value of `i` remains unchanged unless it was incremented in the initial state condition, but since no increment operation is present in the given code snippet, `i` stays as `1` or any value less than `n` that it might have been initially.
