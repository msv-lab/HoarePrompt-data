Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is not lowercase. Additionally, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches the character at index `i` in `template` when converted to lowercase. If the condition in the if statement is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
