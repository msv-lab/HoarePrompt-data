Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postconditions**:
   - `match_a_b` is True if either `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0 if either of the conditions above is met; otherwise, `match_a_b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

3. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `match_a_b` is True.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0 if either of the conditions is met; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `match_a_b` was True, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 0. Given that `match_a_b` was True, `n` is already greater than 0.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `match_a_b` remains True (since it was True and no condition changed it).
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`match_a_b` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0**.
