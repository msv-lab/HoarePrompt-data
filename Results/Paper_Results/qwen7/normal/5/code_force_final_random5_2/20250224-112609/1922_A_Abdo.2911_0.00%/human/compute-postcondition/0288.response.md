Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the first element of the template is not a lowercase letter.**

Explanation: The variable `match_c` is explicitly set to `False`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition about the first element of the template remain unchanged from the initial state.
