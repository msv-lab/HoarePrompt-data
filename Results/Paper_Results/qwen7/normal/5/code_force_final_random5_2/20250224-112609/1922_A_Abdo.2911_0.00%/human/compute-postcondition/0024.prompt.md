Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input value, `b` is the stripped input value, `c` is the stripped input value from the current line of input, `template` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and if the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are equal, `template` now contains `a[0]`. Otherwise, `template` now contains the uppercase version of the element at index `i` of list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `template` is a list. If the element at index 1 of list `a` is equal to the element at index 1 of list `b`, then `template` contains `a[1]` and an additional element `a[1]` is appended to `template`. Otherwise, `template` contains the uppercase version of `a[1]` and remains a list with one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `n` must be greater than 3. If `a[3]` is equal to `b[3]`, then `template` will have an element `a[3]` appended to it. Otherwise, `template` will be a list with one element which is `a[3].upper()`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
