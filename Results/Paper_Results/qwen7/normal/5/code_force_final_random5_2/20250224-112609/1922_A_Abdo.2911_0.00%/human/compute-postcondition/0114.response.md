Output State: **`match_a_b` is `True`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `c` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of `a[i]`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the `template` list. Since `i` was initially 0, after appending, `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
