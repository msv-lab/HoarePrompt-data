Output State: **`match_a_b` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. We break out of the loop or statement we were inside.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement has been executed, causing the program to exit the loop or statement it was currently inside. The values of `match_a_b`, `i`, `n`, and the conditions related to `template[i]`, `a[i]`, and `b[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
