Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal one. The values of `match_a_b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` is still valid.
