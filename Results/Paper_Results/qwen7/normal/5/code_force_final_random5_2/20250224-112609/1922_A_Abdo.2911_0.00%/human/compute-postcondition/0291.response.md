Postcondition: `match_c` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the first element of the template is not a lowercase letter. If the lowercase version of `c[i]` equals the lowercase version of `template[i]`, then `match_c` remains True, `i` becomes 1, and the first element of the template is not a lowercase letter. If the condition is not met, `match_c` remains True, `i` remains 0, and the first element of the template is not a lowercase letter.
