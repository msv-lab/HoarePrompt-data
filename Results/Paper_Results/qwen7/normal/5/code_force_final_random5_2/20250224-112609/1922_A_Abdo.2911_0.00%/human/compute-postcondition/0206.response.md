Output State: `match_c` is True, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3.

In natural language: The loop has executed all its iterations from 0 to n-1. Since no breaking conditions were met within the loop (no mismatch in lowercase characters or case-insensitive mismatches), `match_c` remains True. The variable `i` has reached the value of `n-1`, which means the loop has completed all its iterations. Therefore, `i` is 3, assuming `n` was at least 4. All other variables' states remain unchanged from their initial or previously described states.
