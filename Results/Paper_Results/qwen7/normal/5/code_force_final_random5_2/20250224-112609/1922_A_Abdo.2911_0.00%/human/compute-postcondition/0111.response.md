Output State: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is either True or False, `c` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `template` is a list containing `a[i]`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `template.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `template`. Since `i` is 0 initially, `template` now contains `a[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
