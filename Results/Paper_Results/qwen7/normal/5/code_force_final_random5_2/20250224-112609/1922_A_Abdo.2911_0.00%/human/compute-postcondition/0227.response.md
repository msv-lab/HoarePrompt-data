Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is a positive integer; `template` has appended `a[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `template.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to the list `template`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `template` will append `a[1]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
