Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2) or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` (if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3), where `total_sum` is the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the value equal to `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair, `cnt` is the next integer greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt >= 2`) or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` (if the if condition is not met). `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair, `cnt` is the next integer in `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is at least 2, or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is at least 3, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
