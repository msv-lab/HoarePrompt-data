Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is updated to the count of occurrences of `x` in `num_of_lens`, which is either the current count plus one or 1 if `x` was not previously in `num_of_lens`; `x` is the next element from `nums`; `nums` has at least one element remaining.**

This means that the dictionary `num_of_lens` has been updated to reflect the number of times the current element `x` has appeared so far. The variable `x` is now set to the next element from the list `nums`, and `nums` still contains at least one element.
