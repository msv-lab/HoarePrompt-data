Output State: The `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain the count of each unique integer from the `nums` list. Specifically, for every integer `x` in `nums`, `num_of_lens[x]` will be set to the number of times `x` appears in `nums`. All other variables (`cnt`, `res`, `t`, `n`, and `nums`) will remain in their final states as determined by the loop's execution until it terminates, with `nums` being an empty list since all elements have been processed.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, the `num_of_lens` dictionary will show how many times each number in the original `nums` list appeared. The other variables will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, with `nums` being empty because all elements have been counted.
