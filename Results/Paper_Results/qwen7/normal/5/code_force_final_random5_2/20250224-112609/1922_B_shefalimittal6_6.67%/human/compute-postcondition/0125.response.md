Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `num_of_lens` will be an empty dictionary, as it gets reset for each iteration of the outer loop. The variable `res` will contain the sum of all combinatorial calculations performed over all integers in the `num_of_lens.values()` from all iterations of the loop, where for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, we add `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to `res`, and for each `cnt` that is greater than or equal to 2, we add `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to `res`, with `total_sum` being the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.
