Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `cnt`, which is iterating over the values of `num_of_lens`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop will iterate over each value in `num_of_lens.values()`. This means `cnt` will take on the values of the counts of each element in `nums`.

3. **Determine the Initial State**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute, meaning `num_of_lens.values()` must contain at least one value. Since `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `nums` and its value is the total count of occurrences of that element, `num_of_lens` must be non-empty.

4. **Adjust the States**: 
   - `num_of_lens` must be a non-empty dictionary.
   - `cnt` will take on the values from `num_of_lens.values()`, so there must be at least one value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` is non-empty and that `cnt` can take on at least one value from `num_of_lens.values()`.

State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` must be able to take on at least one value from `num_of_lens.values()`**
