Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`. The variables involved here are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `cnt` and `num_of_lens`**:
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains counts of each unique integer from the original `nums` list.
   - `cnt` is one of the values from this dictionary.

3. **Check if the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one value (i.e., there must be at least one unique integer in `nums`).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `num_of_lens` must contain at least one value for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` is not empty.
   - The value of `cnt` will be one of the values in `num_of_lens`, but we don't need to specify its exact value since the loop will iterate over all values in `num_of_lens`.

Given the initial state where `res` is 0, `num_of_lens` contains counts of each unique integer from the original `nums` list, and `cnt`, `res`, `t`, and `n` retain their values from the final iteration of the loop, and `nums` is an empty list, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` is not empty for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`num_of_lens` must not be empty**.
