Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2) or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` (if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3), where `total_sum` is the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the value equal to `cnt`.
