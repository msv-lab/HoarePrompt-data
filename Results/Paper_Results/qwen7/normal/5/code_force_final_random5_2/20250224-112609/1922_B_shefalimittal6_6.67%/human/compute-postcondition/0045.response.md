Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is updated to include the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, and the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits them into a list of integers named `nums`. The `num_of_lens` dictionary remains unchanged, and the calculation for `res` is not performed yet since it depends on the values in `num_of_lens` which are still empty. Therefore, the only new variable is `nums`, which now holds the list of integers from the input.
