Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`. This means that `total_sum` is updated to exclude the value of `cnt`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `cnt`, `res`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
