Based on the initial state provided:

- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where all keys have been processed.
- `res` contains the sum of all combinatorial calculations performed during the loop iterations.

The `print(res)` statement will print the value stored in the variable `res`.

Since `res` is described as containing the sum of all combinatorial calculations, and no specific formula or values for these calculations are provided, we can only refer to `res` itself.

Output: **res (where res is the sum of all combinatorial calculations performed during the loop iterations)**
