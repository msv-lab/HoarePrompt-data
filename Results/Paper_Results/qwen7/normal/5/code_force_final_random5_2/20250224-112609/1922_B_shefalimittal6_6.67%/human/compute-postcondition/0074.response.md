Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair, `cnt` is the next integer in `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` increments `res` by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `cnt`, and `total_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
