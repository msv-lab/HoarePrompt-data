Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum`. The value of `total_sum` remains unchanged, and the condition for updating `res` is based on the current value of `cnt`. The output state includes the updated relationship between `res` and `total_sum` based on the value of `cnt`.
