Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- `nums` must have at least one element.
- `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 and equals `num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1`.

### Loop Head Analysis
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in `nums`.
- The only variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `nums`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `nums`.
   - After the previous iteration, `nums` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.

2. **Update the State:**
   - Since `x` is the current element being processed in the loop, it will be the next value of `x` in the next iteration.
   - `nums` will lose the current element `x` (the one just processed), but it must still have at least one element left for the loop to continue.

### Updated State
- `nums` must have at least one element remaining.
- `x` will be the next element from `nums`.

### Final Answer
State: **`nums` must have at least one element remaining, `x` will be the next element from `nums`**
