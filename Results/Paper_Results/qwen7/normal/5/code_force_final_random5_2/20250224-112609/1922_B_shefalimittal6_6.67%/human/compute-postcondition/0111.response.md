Output State: **`res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `num_of_lens` must not be empty, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
