Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, and `total_sum` is the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the value equal to `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. The value of `total_sum` remains unchanged from its previous definition as the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the value equal to `cnt`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `cnt`, and `total_sum`) retain their previous states.
