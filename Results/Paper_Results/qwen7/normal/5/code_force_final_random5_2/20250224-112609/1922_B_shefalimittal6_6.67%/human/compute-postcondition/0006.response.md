Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` (where `x` is an element from `nums`) and its value is the count of occurrences of `x` in `nums`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).**

Explanation: The code updates the `num_of_lens` dictionary by incrementing the count of the integer `x` (which is an element from the list `nums`). Since `x` is taken from `nums`, the dictionary `num_of_lens` will have keys that are elements from `nums` and their corresponding values will be the count of how many times each key appears in `nums`. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
