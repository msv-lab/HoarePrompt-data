Output State: **`num_of_lens` dictionary is empty, `cnt` is the last integer value from the original `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the sum of applying the given combinatorial operations over all integers in the original `num_of_lens.values()` that met the conditions, `t` is reduced by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)`. It then converts the map object to a list and assigns it to the variable `nums`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `cnt`, `res`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
