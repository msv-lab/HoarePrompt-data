Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 if `x` is in `num_of_lens`, otherwise it is initialized to 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the count of the length `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. If `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, its corresponding value (which is an integer representing the count) is incremented by 1. If `x` is not a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added as a new key with a value of 1. The list `nums` remains unchanged and is still a non-empty list.
