Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is a value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus the combination of `cnt` taken 2 at a time multiplied by `total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to it, but only if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. The `total_sum` is calculated as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding `cnt`. The values of `num_of_lens`, `cnt`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged except for the updated `res`.
