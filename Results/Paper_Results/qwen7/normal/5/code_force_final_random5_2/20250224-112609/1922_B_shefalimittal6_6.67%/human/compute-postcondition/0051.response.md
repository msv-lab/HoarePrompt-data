Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list, `x` is the next element in the list `nums`, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 if `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, otherwise `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1.**

This means that the dictionary `num_of_lens` will have its count for the key `x` incremented by 1 if `x` was already a key in the dictionary, or it will be initialized to 1 if `x` was not a key before. The lists `nums` and the value of `x` remain unchanged.
