Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`. This means the loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition states that `num_of_lens` must not be empty, and `res` is updated based on the value of `cnt`. Specifically, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `cnt` is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`, the value of `cnt` changes with each iteration.
   - After the previous iteration, `num_of_lens` must not be empty, and `res` is updated based on the previous value of `cnt`.
   - For the next iteration, `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and the condition for updating `res` will be checked again.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `num_of_lens` must still not be empty because it must contain at least one value for the loop to continue.
- `res` will be updated based on the new value of `cnt` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.
- The value of `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next value of `cnt` being processed.

**State: **`num_of_lens` must not be empty, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(next_cnt, 2) * total_sum` (where `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `next_cnt`) if `next_cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, or `res` and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged if `next_cnt` is less than 2, and `next_cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.
