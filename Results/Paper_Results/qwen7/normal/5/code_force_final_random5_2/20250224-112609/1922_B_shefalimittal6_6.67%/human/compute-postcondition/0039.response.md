Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `num_of_lens` remains a dictionary where each key is an element from `nums` and its value is the total count of occurrences of that element in `nums`. The variable `res` is updated to include the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, and the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.

In simpler terms, `res` accumulates the combinations of counts of elements that appear 3 or more times, and the product of combinations of counts of elements that appear 2 or more times with the sum of counts of all other elements, for each unique element in the list `nums`.
