Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 if `x` is in `num_of_lens`, otherwise it is initialized to 1; `num_of_lens[x]` is now the count of occurrences of `x` in `nums`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `num_of_lens` dictionary. It increments the count of `x` by 1 if `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`. If `x` is not a key in `num_of_lens`, it initializes `num_of_lens[x]` to 1. Therefore, `num_of_lens[x]` now holds the number of times `x` appears in the list `nums`.
