Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `e` is an empty string, `q` is the last character of the original `e` (which is now empty), `P` is the total count of '+' characters in the original `e`, and `M` is the total count of '-' or any other characters in the original `e`**.

In simpler terms, after the loop runs through all characters of the string `e`, `e` becomes an empty string, `q` will be the last character of the original `e` (though it's technically irrelevant since `e` is empty), `P` will hold the total number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` will hold the total number of '-' and any other characters in `e`.
