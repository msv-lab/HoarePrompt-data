Output State: **`M` is increased by 1, `e` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `q` is the new last character of `e`.**

The code `M += 1` increments the value of `M` by 1. The values of `e` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state, with `e` being a non-empty string that is one character shorter than before, and `q` being the new last character of `e`.
