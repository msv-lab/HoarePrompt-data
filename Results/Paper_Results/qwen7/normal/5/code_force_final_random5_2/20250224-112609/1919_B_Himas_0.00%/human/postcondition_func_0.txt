The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `s` (1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000) and a string `e` of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) containing characters '+' and '-'. For each test case, it counts the number of '+' characters and subtracts the number of '-' characters in `e`, then prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that all test cases have been handled, and the final output is the cumulative sum of these differences for all test cases.
