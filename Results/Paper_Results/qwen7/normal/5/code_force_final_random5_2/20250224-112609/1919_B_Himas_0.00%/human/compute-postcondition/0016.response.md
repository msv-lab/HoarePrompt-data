Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the second character of `e`, `P` is 1 if `q` is '+', otherwise `P` is 0, `M` is 2 if `q` is '+', otherwise `M` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `M` is incremented by 1. Since `M` was initially 1 if `q` is not '+' and 0 if `q` is '+', after executing `M += 1`, `M` will be 2 if `q` is '+' (previously 1) and 1 if `q` is not '+' (previously 0). All other variables remain unchanged.
