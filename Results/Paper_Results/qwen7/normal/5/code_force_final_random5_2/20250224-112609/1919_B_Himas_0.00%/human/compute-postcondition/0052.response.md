Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `e` is an empty string.
   - `q` is the last character of the original `e` (which is now empty).
   - `P` is the total count of '+' characters in the original `e`.
   - `M` is the total count of '-' or any other characters in the original `e`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each integer in the range specified by `int(input())`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to the number of iterations completed so far.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input())`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - `e` remains an empty string because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `e`.
   - `q` remains the last character of the original `e` (which is still empty).
   - `P` remains the total count of '+' characters in the original `e`.
   - `M` remains the total count of '-' or any other characters in the original `e`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`e` is an empty string, `q` is the last character of the original `e` (which is now empty), `P` is the total count of '+' characters in the original `e`, `M` is the total count of '-' or any other characters in the original `e`, and `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since the exact value of `int(input())` is not known, we represent it symbolically. Let's denote the value of `int(input())` as `N`. Then, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`e` is an empty string, `q` is the last character of the original `e` (which is now empty), `P` is the total count of '+' characters in the original `e`, `M` is the total count of '-' or any other characters in the original `e`, and `i` is `i + 1` where `i < N`**.

However, since `N` is the input value and not explicitly given, we can simply say:

State: **`e` is an empty string, `q` is the last character of the original `e` (which is now empty), `P` is the total count of '+' characters in the original `e`, `M` is the total count of '-' or any other characters in the original `e`, and `i` is incremented by 1**.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`e` is an empty string, `q` is the last character of the original `e` (which is now empty), `P` is the total count of '+' characters in the original `e`, `M` is the total count of '-' or any other characters in the original `e`, and `i` is incremented by 1**.
