Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `q` and `e`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character `q` in the string `e`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `e` is a non-empty string.
   - `q` is the last character of `e`.
   - If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1. Otherwise, `M` is 1.

4. **Consider the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be the next character in the string `e`.
   - Since `q` was the last character in the previous iteration, the next character `q` will be the second-to-last character of `e`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `e` remains the same string (non-empty).
   - `q` changes to the second-to-last character of `e`.
   - `P` and `M` remain unchanged unless the new value of `q` changes their values.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `e` is a non-empty string.
- `q` is the second-to-last character of `e`.
- `P` is 1 if the second-to-last character is '+', otherwise `M` is 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the second-to-last character of `e`, `P` is 1 if the second-to-last character is '+', otherwise `M` is 1.**
