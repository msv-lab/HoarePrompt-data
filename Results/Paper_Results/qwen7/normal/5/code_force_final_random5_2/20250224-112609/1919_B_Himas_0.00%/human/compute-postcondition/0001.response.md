Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `s` is an input integer.**

The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `s`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` also remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is still 0, and `s` is the integer input by the user.
