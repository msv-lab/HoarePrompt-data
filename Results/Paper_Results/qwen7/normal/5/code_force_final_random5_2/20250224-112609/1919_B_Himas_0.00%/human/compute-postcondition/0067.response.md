Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string with at least one character left, `q` is the first character of the remaining part of `e`, `P` is 2, `M` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is an input integer, and if `q` is `'+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0; otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1, and `q` is not equal to `'+'**.

Explanation: The value of `P` is incremented by 1, so `P` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
