Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `f` is the second integer input minus 2, `k` is the third integer input minus 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. Initially, `k` was equal to the third integer input minus 1. After executing the code, `k` is now equal to the third integer input minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
