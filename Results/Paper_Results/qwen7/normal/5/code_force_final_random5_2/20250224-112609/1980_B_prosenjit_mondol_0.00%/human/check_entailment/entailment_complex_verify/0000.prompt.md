You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be the total number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, `n` will be the number of elements in the list `a`, `f` will be the original `f` minus the number of times the loop has executed, `k` will be the original `k` minus the number of times the loop has executed, and `a` will be a list of integers sorted in descending order. The variable `x` will be the element at index `f` in the list `a`. The loop will print either 'NO', 'YES', or 'MAYBE' based on the comparison between `a[k]` and `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer list `a` of length `n`, two indices `f` and `k` (both initially within the bounds of `a`), and determines whether the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a` is greater than the element at index `k`. If the element at `f` is greater than the element at `k`, it prints 'NO'. If the element at `f` is less than the element at `k`, it prints 'YES'. If the elements are equal, it prints 'YES' unless the element at `k-1` is also equal to the element at `f`, in which case it prints 'MAYBE'. The function implicitly accepts the number of test cases `t` as input and iterates through them, printing the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where the favorite cube is removed but the next highest value cube is also removed, leading to ambiguity about whether the favorite cube was actually removed.

Let's analyze the problematic case:

Consider the input:
```
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
- The original values are `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`.
- After sorting in non-increasing order, the values become `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`.
- The favorite cube (index 1, value 3) is in the second position.
- The program checks if `a[k]` (which is 2) is greater than the value of the favorite cube (3). Since 2 is not greater than 3, the program prints "NO".

However, the favorite cube is still in the sorted list, and if we remove the first two cubes, the favorite cube would indeed be removed. Therefore, the correct output should be "YES" in this case.

The program incorrectly handles the scenario where the favorite cube is in a position that might be removed, but the next highest value cube is also removed, leading to ambiguity. This indicates that the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
