Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `k` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at index `f` in the list `a` to the variable `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged except that `k` is decreased by 1.
