Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.
- `k` is decreased by 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.
- The current value of `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.
- List `a` is sorted in descending order.
- The element at index `k` in list `a` is greater than `x`.

The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given this information, the print statement will simply output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
