Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input separated by spaces and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value between 1 and 1000.
