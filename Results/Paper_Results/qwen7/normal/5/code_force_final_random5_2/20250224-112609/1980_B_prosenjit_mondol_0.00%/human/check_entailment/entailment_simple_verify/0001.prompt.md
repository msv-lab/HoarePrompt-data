You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be the total number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, `n` will be the number of elements in the list `a`, `f` will be the original `f` minus the number of times the loop has executed, `k` will be the original `k` minus the number of times the loop has executed, and `a` will be a list of integers sorted in descending order. The variable `x` will be the element at index `f` in the list `a`. The loop will print either 'NO', 'YES', or 'MAYBE' based on the comparison between `a[k]` and `x`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` from the input.
   - It adjusts `f` and `k` by subtracting 1 because indices in Python start from 0.
   - It reads the list of values `a` from the input.

2. **Sorting and Comparing:**
   - The program sorts the list `a` in reverse order (non-increasing).
   - It checks if the value at index `k` in the sorted list is greater than the original value of the favorite cube (`x`).
     - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes in the sorted list, so it won't be removed. Hence, it prints "NO".
     - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube is definitely among the first `k` cubes in the sorted list, so it will be removed. Hence, it prints "YES".
     - If `a[k] == x`, it means the favorite cube is exactly at index `k` in the sorted list. However, the problem states that if two cubes have the same value, they can be in any order. Therefore, we need to check if the favorite cube might still be among the first `k` cubes after sorting.

3. **Handling Equal Values:**
   - If `a[k] == x`, the program further checks:
     - If `k` is the last index (`n - 1`), the favorite cube is definitely among the first `k` cubes, so it prints "YES".
     - Otherwise, it checks if the value before `k` (i.e., `a[k - 1]`) is less than `x`. If so, the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes, and it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE".

### Correctness Check

Let's verify the logic with some examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `5 2 2`
   - `a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`
   - `a[1] = 3` which is equal to `x = 3`
   - Since `k = 1` and `a[0] = 4 > 3`, the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes.
   - Output: `NO` (Correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 3`
   - `a = [4, 2, 1, 3, 5]`
   - Sorted: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - `a[2] = 3` which is less than `x = 5`
   - Output: `YES` (Correct)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `5 5 2`
   - `a = [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - `a[1] = 4` which is greater than `x = 5`
   - Output: `NO` (Correct)

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 5`
   - `a = [1, 2, 5, 4, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - `a[4] = 1` which is less than `x = 5`
   - Output: `YES` (Correct)

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `5 5 4`
   - `a = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`
   - Sorted: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - `a[3] = 2` which is less than `x = 5`
   - Output: `YES` (Correct)

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `5 5 5`
   - `a = [4, 3, 2, 1, 5]`
   - Sorted: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - `a[4] = 1` which is less than `x = 5`
   - Output: `YES` (Correct)

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `6 5 3`
   - `a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1]`
   - `a[2] = 3` which is equal to `x = 3`
   - Since `k = 2` and `a[1] = 3`, the favorite cube might be among the first `k` cubes.
   - Output: `MAYBE` (Correct)

8. **Example 8:**
   - Input: `10 1 1`
   - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `a[0] = 1` which is equal to `x = 1`
   - Since `k = 0` and `a[-1] = 1`, the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes.
   - Output: `NO` (Correct)

9. **Example 9:**
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - `a = [42]`
   - Sorted: `[42]`
   - `a[0] = 42` which is equal to `x = 42`
   - Since `k = 0` and `a[-1] = 42`, the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes.
   - Output: `NO` (Correct)

10. **Example 10:**
    - Input: `5 2 3`
    - `a = [2, 2, 1, 1, 2]`
    - Sorted: `[2, 2, 2, 1, 1]`
    - `a[2] = 2` which is equal to `x = 2`
    - Since `k = 2` and `a[1] = 2`, the favorite cube might be among the first `k` cubes.
    - Output: `MAYBE` (Correct)

11. **Example 11:**
    - Input: `2 1 1`
    - `a = [2, 1]`
    - Sorted: `[2, 1]`
    - `a[0] = 2` which is equal to `x = 2`
    - Since `k = 0` and `a[-1] = 1`, the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes.
    - Output: `NO` (Correct)

12. **Example 12:**
    - Input: `5 3 1`
    - `a = [3, 3, 2, 3, 2]`
    - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 2, 2]`
    - `a[0] = 3` which is equal to `x = 3`
    - Since `k = 0` and `a[-1] = 2`, the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes.
    - Output: `NO` (Correct)
