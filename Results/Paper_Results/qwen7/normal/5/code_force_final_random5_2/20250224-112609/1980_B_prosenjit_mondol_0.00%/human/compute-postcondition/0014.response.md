Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.
- `k` is decreased by 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.
- `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.
- List `a` is sorted in descending order.
- `a[k]` is less than `x`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are not relevant to the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **YES**
