Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k`, and adjusts `f` and `k` by subtracting 1 to account for 0-based indexing.
3. It then reads the list of integers `a` and sorts it in descending order.
4. The logic to determine whether the favorite cube will be removed is correct:
   - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube is not removed, so it prints 'NO'.
   - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube is definitely removed, so it prints 'YES'.
   - If `a[k] == x`, it checks if the cube would still be removed if it were the last element (`k == n - 1`) or if the previous element is smaller (`a[k - 1] < x`). This ensures that the cube might be removed if it is exactly equal to the `k`-th element but not necessarily the `k`-th element itself.

Given this analysis, the provided code matches the problem description and handles all the conditions correctly.

Correctness: **True**
