Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input, `f` is the second integer input minus 1, `k` is the third integer input minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and sorted in descending order, `f` is decreased by 1, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`, `new_input` is a positive integer.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to `n`, `f`, and `k` respectively. It also mentions that `k` is now `k - 1`, which means `k` is decremented by 1. Additionally, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and sorted in descending order. The value of `f` is decreased by 1, and `x` is set to the element at index `f` in list `a`. The variable `new_input` is mentioned to be a positive integer but is not used in the given code snippet.
