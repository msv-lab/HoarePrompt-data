Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element (excluding the first element), `n` is the second element of the updated list `arr`, and `freq[n]` is incremented by 1, resulting in `freq[n]` being the count of occurrences of `n` in `arr`.**

This means that the frequency dictionary `freq` now has the count of how many times the second element `n` of the list `arr` appears in the list.
