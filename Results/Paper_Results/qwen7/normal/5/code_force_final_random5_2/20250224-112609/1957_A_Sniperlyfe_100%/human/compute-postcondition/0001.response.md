Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `n`, which is being assigned values from the list `arr` during each iteration.

2. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: Since the loop assigns values from `arr` to `n`, the initial value of `n` before the loop starts should be the first element of the list `arr`.

3. **Understand the structure of `arr`**: The list `arr` contains the lengths of sticks, and its length (`len(arr)`) represents the number of sticks available. However, `n` itself is not directly used as an index but rather as the value from the list.

4. **Initial state of `freq`**: The dictionary `freq` is initially empty. The loop will modify this dictionary, but since we are focusing on the initial state before the loop starts, we don't need to adjust anything about `freq` for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the state of `arr`**: The list `arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. Since the problem specifies that `1 <= n <= 100` and each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100, we can assume `arr` is non-empty.

Given these points, the only adjustments needed are to ensure that `n` is set to the first element of `arr` and that `arr` is non-empty.

**Final State**:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the list must have at least one element.
- `n` is the first element of the list `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of the list `arr`**
