Output State: The `freq` dictionary will contain the count of each unique stick length from the original `arr` list. Specifically, for every unique stick length present in `arr`, the corresponding value in `freq` will be the total number of times that stick length appears in `arr`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `freq` dictionary will map each distinct stick length to its frequency in the original list `arr`.
