Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element (excluding the first element), `n` is the first element of the updated list `arr`, and `freq[n]` is incremented by 1, resulting in `freq[n]` being equal to 1.**

This means that the frequency of the first element `n` in the list `arr` has been incremented by 1, making its count 1 in the dictionary `freq`.
