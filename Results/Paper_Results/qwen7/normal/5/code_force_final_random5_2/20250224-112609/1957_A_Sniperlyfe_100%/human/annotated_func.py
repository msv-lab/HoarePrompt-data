#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The `freq` dictionary will contain the count of each unique stick length from the original `arr` list. Specifically, for every unique stick length present in `arr`, the corresponding value in `freq` will be the total number of times that stick length appears in `arr`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `freq` dictionary will map each distinct stick length to its frequency in the original list `arr`.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3, where each frequency represents the count of a unique stick length in the original `arr` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks. It calculates the frequency of each unique stick length in the list and then returns the sum of these frequencies divided by 3.
