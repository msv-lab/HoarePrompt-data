Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 is still valid. Additionally, `n` is now an integer input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
