Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers based on certain constraints. It checks each integer in the list to ensure it falls within the range 1 to 100, inclusive. If any integer outside this range is found, it returns an error message indicating the issue. Otherwise, it returns a specific value or message based on the processed list.**

This means the function is designed to validate a list of integers against given constraints (each integer must be between 1 and 100, inclusive) and provide feedback based on whether the list meets these criteria or not.
