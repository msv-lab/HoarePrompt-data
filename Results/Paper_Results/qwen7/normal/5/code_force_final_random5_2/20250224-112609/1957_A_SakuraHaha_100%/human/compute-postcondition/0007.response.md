Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `x`: This variable takes on the value of each element in the list `a` during each iteration.
   - `a`: This list remains the same throughout the loop iterations.

3. **Analyze the initial state**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is iterating over the elements of `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will take on the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` itself does not change; it remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `ans` and `cnt` remain unchanged because they are not directly modified within the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
   - `n` remains the same (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
   - `a` remains the same (non-empty list of integers).
   - `ans` remains 0.
   - `cnt` remains the same (dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`**.
