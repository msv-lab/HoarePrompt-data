Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, `x` is the next element from the list `a`, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1.**

The code updates the count of the element `x` in the dictionary `cnt`. The value of `x` is taken from the list `a`, and its count in `cnt` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
