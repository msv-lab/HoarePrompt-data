The function processes a list of integers `a` and calculates the sum of counts of each integer in the list divided by 3. It then prints the result of this calculation. The function does not return any value but modifies the internal state by updating the dictionary `cnt` with the count of each integer in the list. The function reads the length of the list and the list itself from standard input.
