You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the following list contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, and `x` is the last element from the list `a` with `cnt[x]` incremented by 1.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` and `n` will retain their initial values, `a` will be the same list of integers it started with (though `cnt` will have been updated), and `ans` will still be 0. The dictionary `cnt` will contain the count of each integer in the list `a`. The variable `x` will be the last element of the list `a`, and its count in `cnt` will be incremented by 1 compared to its previous count.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ans` is `ans + sum(cnt.values())`, `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a` (with the count of the current `x` incremented by 1 for each iteration), and `x` is the last element from the list `a` with `cnt[x]` incremented by the total number of iterations.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: len(a)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the cases where multiple polygons can be formed. Specifically, the program only counts the number of sides that can form triangles (since `x // 3` is used), but it should consider forming other types of polygons as well (e.g., squares, pentagons, etc.). For example, in the fourth test case, the program outputs `2`, which is correct because it can form a pentagon with side length 2 and a square with side length 4. However, the program does not handle cases where forming multiple polygons of different types is possible, such as forming a triangle and a quadrilateral. For instance, if the input is `6 2 2 2 3 3 3`, the program would output `2` (one triangle and one quadrilateral), but it should output `2` (two triangles). Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases.
