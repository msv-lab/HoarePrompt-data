Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, and for every key `x` in `cnt`, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1.**

This means that for every element `x` in the list `a`, the count of that element in the dictionary `cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, and the structure of `cnt` remain unchanged except that each count in `cnt` is updated to reflect one more occurrence of the corresponding element in `a`.
