Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.
2. **Current States**: 
   - `number` is a positive integer and must be at least 3.
   - `size` is 2.

3. **Evaluate the Current Loop Condition**:
   - Substitute `size = 2` into the condition: `(1 << (2 + 1)) - 1 <= number`.
   - Simplify the expression: `(1 << 3) - 1 <= number`.
   - Calculate the value: `8 - 1 <= number` which simplifies to `7 <= number`.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1 <= number` must still hold true.
   - Increment `size` by 1 for the next iteration: `size = 3`.
   - Substitute `size = 3` into the condition: `(1 << (3 + 1)) - 1 <= number`.
   - Simplify the expression: `(1 << 4) - 1 <= number`.
   - Calculate the value: `16 - 1 <= number` which simplifies to `15 <= number`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on both `number` and `size`, we need to ensure that the condition holds true for the next iteration.
   - `number` must be at least 15 for the loop to continue.
   - `size` must be incremented to 3.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `number` must be at least 15.
- `size` must be 3.

State: **`number` must be at least 15, `size` is 3**
