Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `size`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `size`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `number` must be at least 255 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `i` is 3.
   - `size` is 8.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `size`.
   - Currently, `i` is 3 and `size` is 8, so `i < size` is true.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 4.
   - `size` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`number` must be at least 255, `i` is 4, `size` is 8**
