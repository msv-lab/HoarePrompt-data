    #State: Output State: `number` must be at least 255; `size` is 8.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `size` as long as `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`. After each iteration, `size` increases by 1. Given that after 3 iterations `number` must be at least 63 and `size` is 6, we can deduce the condition for the loop to continue. Each iteration effectively doubles the threshold value of `number` that needs to be met to continue the loop. Therefore, after 4 iterations, `number` must be at least \(127\) more than the previous threshold (63), making it at least \(127 + 63 = 190\). After 5 iterations, it must be at least \(127 + 190 = 317\), but since the next power of 2 minus 1 that fits within the given range is 255, `number` must be at least 255 for the loop to continue. After 6 iterations, `size` would be 8, and the loop would terminate because the condition `(1 << 8 + 1) - 1 > number` would no longer be satisfied with `number` being 255.

        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `number` must be at least 255, `i` is 8, `size` is 8, `sequence` contains `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
    #
    #Explanation: After 6 iterations, the loop condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` is no longer satisfied when `number` is 255, so the loop terminates. At this point, `i` will be 8 because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < size`, and `size` is 8. The `sequence` list will contain the numbers from 0 to 7 because the loop appends each `i` to the list during its execution.
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: Output State: `number` is 255, `i` is 8, `size` is 8, `sequence` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - 1`, which is 7 iterations since `size` is 8. After the first 3 iterations, the sequence is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]. Since `result` is 0 for all iterations, the expression `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` simplifies to `sequence[-0 - i - 1] += 0`, meaning it does not change any elements in the sequence for the remaining iterations. Therefore, the sequence remains unchanged after all iterations, and the final state matches the state after the third iteration.
    return size + result
    #The program returns 8, and the result is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer, and `sequence`, a list of integers where all elements are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\). If `number` is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the size of the sequence needed based on `number` and fills the `sequence` list with integers from 0 to 7. Finally, it calls itself recursively with a modified `number` and processes the `sequence` list to adjust its values. The function returns either 0 or 8 depending on the input.
