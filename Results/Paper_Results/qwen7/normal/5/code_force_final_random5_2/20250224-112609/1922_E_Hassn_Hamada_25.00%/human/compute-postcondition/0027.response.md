Output State: **`number` is 255, `i` is 8, `size` is 8, `sequence` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1], `result` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates the element in the `sequence` list at the index `sequence[-result - i - 1]` by adding `result` to it. Given the initial values, `result` is 0, `i` is 9, and `sequence` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. The index calculation `sequence[-result - i - 1]` simplifies to `sequence[-0 - 9 - 1]` which is `sequence[-10]`. Since list indices are zero-based, `-10` is out of bounds for the list (which only has indices from 0 to 7). However, in Python, accessing an out-of-bounds index results in an IndexError if not handled. For the sake of this problem, we assume the operation does not raise an error and the closest valid index is taken, which is `sequence[7]` (since `-10 % 8` equals `6` due to modulo operation). Thus, `sequence[7]` (which is initially 7) is updated to `7 + 0`, resulting in `7`. But since the question specifies the exact value, it updates the last element of the sequence to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
