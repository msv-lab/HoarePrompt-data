Output State: **The program returns 8, and the result is 0.**

Given the initial state:
- `number` is 255
- `i` is 8
- `size` is 8
- `sequence` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - 1`, which is 7 iterations. After the first 3 iterations, the sequence is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]. Since `result` is 0 for all iterations, the expression `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` simplifies to `sequence[-0 - i - 1] += 0`, meaning it does not change any elements in the sequence for the remaining iterations. Therefore, the sequence remains unchanged after all iterations.

The return statement `return size + result` adds the value of `size` (which is 8) and the value of `result` (which is 0) together, resulting in 8.
