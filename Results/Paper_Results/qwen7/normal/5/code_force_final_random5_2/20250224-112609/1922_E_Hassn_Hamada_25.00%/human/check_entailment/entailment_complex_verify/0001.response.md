### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`).
   - The array length should be at most 200.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the sequence based on the input number.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.
   - The key logic in `func_1` involves binary representation and manipulation to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Binary Representation Insight:**
   - The function uses binary representation to determine the sequence. Specifically, it uses the formula `(1 << size + 1) - 1` to check the number of possible increasing subsequences.
   - The function iteratively builds the sequence and adjusts values to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The function correctly handles the base case when `number == 0`.
   - It uses a loop to build the sequence and recursively adjust values to match the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The assertions in the code help ensure the sequence is built correctly.

5. **Output Handling:**
   - The main loop reads the test cases and calls `func_1` to generate the sequence.
   - The sequence is printed with the appropriate length and values.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - For small values of `X`, the function should produce valid sequences.
   - For larger values, the function should still produce valid sequences as long as the binary representation logic holds.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the function `func_1`, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

- **Assertion in `func_1`:**
  ```python
  for i in range(size):
      assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
  ```
  This assertion is redundant and does not serve any meaningful purpose in ensuring the correctness of the sequence. It checks an inequality that is always true given the context of the loop and the sequence construction.

- **Recursive Call in `func_1`:**
  ```python
  result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
  ```
  The recursive call is made with `number - (1 << size) + 1`. This subtraction and addition do not align with the intended logic of generating the sequence. Instead, the function should directly manipulate the sequence based on the binary representation without unnecessary recursive calls.

- **Sequence Construction:**
  The sequence construction logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function should use the binary representation to construct the sequence correctly. However, the current implementation does not properly handle the binary representation to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences.

Given these issues, the function `func_1` does not correctly generate the sequence for arbitrary values of `X`. The recursive approach and the sequence construction logic are not aligned with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The provided implementation does not correctly generate the required sequence for the given problem constraints. The function `func_1` has logical flaws in its sequence construction and recursive calls.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**
