Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `size`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 8.
   - `size` is initially set to 8.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `size`.

Given the initial values:
- `i` is 8.
- `size` is 8.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `size`. Since `i` is currently equal to `size`, the loop will not execute initially. However, we need to ensure that the loop can potentially execute if `i` changes within the loop body.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is less than `size` at some point during the loop execution.
   - Since `i` starts at 8 and `size` is also 8, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `size` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than `size`.

**Final State**:
State: **`number` is 255, `i` is less than `size`, `size` is 8, `sequence` contains `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(255 - (1 << 8) + 1, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])`**

Note: The values of `number`, `sequence`, and `result` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop execution directly.
