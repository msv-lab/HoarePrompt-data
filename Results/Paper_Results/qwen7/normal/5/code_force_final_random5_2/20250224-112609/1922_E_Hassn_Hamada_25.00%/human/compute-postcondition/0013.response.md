State: **`number` must be at least 255, `size` is 8, `i` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts at 0.
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < size`, where `size` is initially 8.
- For the loop to execute, `size` must be at least 8, and `number` must be at least 255 to satisfy the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1` in the loop termination check.

Therefore, the initial state needs to ensure that `number` is at least 255 and `size` is 8, with `i` starting at 0.
