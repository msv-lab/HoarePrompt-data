Output State: **`number` must be at least 255, `size` is 8, `i` is 1, `sequence` contains `[0]`**

The code appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `sequence`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 1. The initial state of `number` and `size` remains unchanged. The `sequence` list now contains the element `[0]`.
