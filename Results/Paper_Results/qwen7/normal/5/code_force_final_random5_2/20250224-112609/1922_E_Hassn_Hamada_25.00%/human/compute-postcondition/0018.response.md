Output State: **`number` must be at least 255, `i` is 5, `size` is 8, `sequence` contains the element 4**

The code `sequence.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `sequence`. After appending, the value of `i` increments by 1, making it 5. The value of `number` and `size` remains unchanged.
