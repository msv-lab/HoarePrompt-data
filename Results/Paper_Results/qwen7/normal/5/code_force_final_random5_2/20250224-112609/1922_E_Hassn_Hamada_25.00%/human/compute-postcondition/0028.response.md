Output State: `number` is 255, `i` is 8, `size` is 8, `sequence` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - 1`, which is 7 iterations in total since `size` is 8. After the first 3 iterations, the sequence is modified as follows: 

- After the 1st iteration (`i = 0`), the sequence remains unchanged because the condition `-len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` evaluates to `True` and `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` is executed with `result` being 0, so no change occurs.
- After the 2nd iteration (`i = 1`), the sequence remains unchanged for the same reason.
- After the 3rd iteration (`i = 2`), the sequence remains unchanged for the same reason.

Since `result` is 0 for all iterations, no changes are made to the sequence beyond the first 3 iterations. Therefore, after all 8 iterations, the sequence remains `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. The other variables (`number`, `i`, `size`, and `result`) remain unchanged as well.
