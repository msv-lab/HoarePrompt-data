Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, an integer `k` such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), and a list `arr` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It performs a binary search on `arr` to find the smallest index `low` such that `arr[low] > k`. If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1 followed by `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, where `pos` is initially -1 and remains unchanged. The function returns no value.**
