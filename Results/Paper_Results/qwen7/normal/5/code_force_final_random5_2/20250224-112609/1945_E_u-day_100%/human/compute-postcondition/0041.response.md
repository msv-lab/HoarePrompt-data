Postcondition: **`low` is 0, `high` is either `mid` or greater than `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2`, `mid`, and `mid`. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `high` is set to `mid`; otherwise, `low` is set to `mid`.**
