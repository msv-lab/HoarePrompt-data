Output State: **`pos` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The line `pos = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 0) to `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `pos` is updated to 0, while `i`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` retain their original values.
