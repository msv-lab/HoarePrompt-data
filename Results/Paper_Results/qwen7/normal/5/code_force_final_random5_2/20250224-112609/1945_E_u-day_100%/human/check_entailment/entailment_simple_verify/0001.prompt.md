You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Objective**: Rearrange the permutation `p` using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search finds `x` at position `l` after the search.
2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - Initialize `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
   - While `r - l > 1`, compute `m = (l + r) // 2`.
   - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`.
   - Otherwise, set `r = m`.

### Provided Code Analysis
1. **Functions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a space-separated line and returns it as a map object.
   - `func_2()`: Converts the map object returned by `func_1()` into a list.
   - `func_3()`: Implements the main logic.

2. **Main Logic in `func_3()`**:
   - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
   - Reads the permutation `arr`.
   - Finds the position `pos` of `k` in `arr`.
   - Initializes `st` as an empty set.
   - Performs a binary search-like operation to find the correct position `low` where `arr[low]` should be `k`.
   - If `arr[low] == k`, prints `0` indicating no swaps needed.
   - Otherwise, prints `1` and performs one swap between `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues with the Provided Code
1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The code attempts to perform a binary search but does not correctly simulate the binary search process. Specifically, the binary search is not used to find the correct position of `k` in the permutation.
   - The code instead uses a set `st` to store mid-values, which is unnecessary and does not contribute to finding the correct position of `k`.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The code assumes that one swap is enough to place `k` at the correct position, which is not necessarily true. The problem statement guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient, but the current implementation only handles one swap.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The code outputs `0` if no swaps are needed, `1` if one swap is needed, but it does not handle the case where two swaps are needed. This violates the requirement to output the number of operations and the positions of the swaps.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that:
- We find the correct positions for `k` using a proper binary search.
- We handle both one and two swaps to place `k` at the correct position.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic and does not handle the problem as specified. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
