Output State: `low` is a value between 0 and `n`, `high` is `low + 1`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2`, `mid`, and `high - 1`. The exact value of `low` depends on the relationship between `arr[mid]` and `k` throughout the iterations, but it will be a value that satisfies the condition `low + 1 < high`.
