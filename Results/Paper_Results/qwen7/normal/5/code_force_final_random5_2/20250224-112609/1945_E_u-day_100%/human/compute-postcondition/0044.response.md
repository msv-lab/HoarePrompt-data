Postcondition: **`low` is either `mid` from the last iteration where `arr[mid] <= k`, `high` is `n` if `low + 1` equals `high` and `arr[low] <= k`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` from the last iteration, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2`, `mid` from the second iteration, and `mid` from the third iteration. The current value of `arr[low]` is equal to `k`**.
