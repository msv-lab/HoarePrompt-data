Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the value `(0 + n) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mid` to be the average of `low` and `high`, which is `(low + high) // 2`. Since `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`, `mid` is updated to `(0 + n) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
