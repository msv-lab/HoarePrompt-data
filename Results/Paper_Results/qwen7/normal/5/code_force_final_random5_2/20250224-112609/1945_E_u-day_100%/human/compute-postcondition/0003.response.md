Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range object defined by `range(n)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of the objects involved in the loop head. Specifically, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 and `n` is a positive integer (which is already given).

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

- `i` should be set to 0 because the loop starts with `i` being 0.
- `n` should remain as it is since it is already given as a positive integer.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `n` should be a positive integer (which is already given).

So, the final state is:

**State: **`pos` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`**.
