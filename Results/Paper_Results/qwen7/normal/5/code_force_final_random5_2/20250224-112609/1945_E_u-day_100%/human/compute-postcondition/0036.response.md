Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step by step.

### Given Loop
```python
while low + 1 < high:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n`
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`
- `pos` remains -1
- `i` is 9 (not relevant for this loop)
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\)
- `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`
- The set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid`.

### Analysis
The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`. For the loop to continue executing, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true. 

Given:
- `low` is currently 0.
- `high` is currently `n`.

For the loop to continue, `0 + 1 < n` must be true, which simplifies to `1 < n`. Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer, `1 < n` is always true as long as `n` is greater than 1.

However, the loop body updates either `high` or `low` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`. We need to determine the conditions under which the loop continues:

1. **If `arr[mid] > k`:**
   - `high` is updated to `mid`.
   
2. **Otherwise (`arr[mid] <= k`):**
   - `low` is updated to `mid`.

### Determining the Next State
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `low + 1 < high` holds true. This means we need to keep `low` and `high` such that `low + 1 < high`.

Since `low` is currently 0, `high` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue. Therefore, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than 1.

### Adjusted State
- `low` is 0 (unchanged)
- `high` must be greater than 1 (to satisfy `low + 1 < high`)

### Final Answer
State: **`low` is 0, `high` must be greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid`.**
