Let's analyze the given loop and the current state step by step.

### Given Loop
```python
while low + 1 < high:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n`
- `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`
- `pos` remains -1
- `i` is 9 (not relevant for this loop)
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n
- `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`
- The set `st` contains the value `(0 + n) // 2`

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.

### Analysis
To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `low + 1 < high` is still true.

Given:
- `low = 0`
- `high = n`

The condition `low + 1 < high` simplifies to `1 < n`.

Since `n` is a positive integer, `1 < n` is always true as long as `n > 1`.

### Conclusion
The loop can certainly execute one more time because the condition `low + 1 < high` is satisfied as long as `n > 1`.

### Adjusted State
No adjustments are needed for the loop head variables since the condition is already met.

### Final Answer
State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the value `(0 + n) // 2`**.
