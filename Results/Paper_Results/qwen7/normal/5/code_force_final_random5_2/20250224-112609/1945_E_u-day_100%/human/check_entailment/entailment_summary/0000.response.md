Reasoning:
- The problem requires rearranging the permutation `p` using at most 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search finds the target value `x` at the position `l` after the search.
- The provided code has three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
- `func_1` reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
- `func_2` converts the result of `func_1` into a list.
- `func_3` is supposed to find the correct positions for the swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.

Let's analyze `func_3`:
1. It first finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation `arr`.
2. It then performs a binary search-like process to find the smallest index `low` such that `arr[low] > x`.
3. If `arr[low]` equals `x`, it prints `0` because no swaps are needed.
4. Otherwise, it prints `1` followed by `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, which indicates the positions to swap.

However, the problem statement specifies that the solution should use at most 2 swaps. The current implementation only handles the case where exactly one swap is needed. We need to check if the solution can handle the case where two swaps are necessary.

To ensure correctness, we need to verify if the function can handle the cases where:
- The target `x` is already in the correct position.
- One swap is needed.
- Two swaps are needed.

Given the execution summary, the function does not explicitly handle the case where two swaps are required. It only checks for one swap and does not account for scenarios where the target `x` might be in a position that requires two swaps to fix.

Therefore, the provided function does not fully meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
