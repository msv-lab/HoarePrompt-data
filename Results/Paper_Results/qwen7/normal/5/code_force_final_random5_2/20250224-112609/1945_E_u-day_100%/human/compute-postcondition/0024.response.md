Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `mid`, `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the value `(0 + n) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Since `mid` was previously calculated as `(0 + n) // 2`, the updated state reflects this change.
