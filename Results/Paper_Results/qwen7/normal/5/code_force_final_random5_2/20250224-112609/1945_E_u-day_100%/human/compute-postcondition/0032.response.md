Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid`.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Since `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`, `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`. The set `st` initially contains the value `(0 + n) // 2`, and now it also includes `mid`, which is the same value. All other variables remain unchanged.
