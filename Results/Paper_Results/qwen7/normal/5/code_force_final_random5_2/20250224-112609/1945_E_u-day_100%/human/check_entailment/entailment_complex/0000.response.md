Reasoning:
- The problem requires rearranging a permutation using at most 2 swaps to make the binary search algorithm work correctly, ensuring that `p[l]` equals `x` after the search.
- The given code does not actually perform the necessary swaps to rearrange the permutation. Instead, it performs a binary search directly on the given permutation without any modifications.
- The binary search logic in `func_3` is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array with at most two swaps. The current implementation does not consider how to place `x` at the correct position `l` before performing the binary search.
- The function `func_3` does not handle the case where the permutation needs to be rearranged with swaps. It simply performs a binary search and outputs the results based on the search outcome, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
