Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and an empty set `st` is created.**

Explanation: The variable `mid` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high`. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`, `mid` becomes `(0 + n) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
