Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    n = int(input())
    num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
    num_of_lens = {}
    for x in num_list:
        if x in num_of_lens:
            num_of_lens[x] += 1
        else:
            num_of_lens[x] = 1
    res = 0
    total_count = 0
    for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
        if cnt >= 3:
            res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
        if cnt >= 2:
            res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
        total_count += cnt
    results.append(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, and `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is the sum of all calculated values from the loop, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`, `num_list` remains an empty list, and `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens` contains the frequency of each integer in `num_list`, `res` is the cumulative sum of `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 for all `cnt` >= 3, plus `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count` for all `cnt` >= 2, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` appended with the current value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
