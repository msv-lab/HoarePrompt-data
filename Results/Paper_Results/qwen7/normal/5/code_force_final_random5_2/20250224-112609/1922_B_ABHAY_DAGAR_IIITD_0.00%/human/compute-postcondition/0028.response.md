Output State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one value, and the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3; `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value. Since `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` will be a non-negative integer. The initial conditions for `num_of_lens` and `cnt` remain unchanged.
