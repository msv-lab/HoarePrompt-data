Postcondition: `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 if `x` was already present, otherwise it is set to 1. `res` remains unchanged if `x` was already present, otherwise `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given. `total_count`, `num_list`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged. `x` is the next value in `num_list`. `test_cases` is decremented by 1.
