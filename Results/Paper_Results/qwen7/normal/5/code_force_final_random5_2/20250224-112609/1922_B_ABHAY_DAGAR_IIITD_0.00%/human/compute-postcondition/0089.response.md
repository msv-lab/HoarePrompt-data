Postcondition: `res` is either `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is less than 2, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0.
