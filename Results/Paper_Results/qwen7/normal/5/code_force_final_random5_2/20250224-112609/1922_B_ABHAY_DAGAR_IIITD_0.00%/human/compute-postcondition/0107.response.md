Output State: **`total_count` is incremented by `cnt`, `res` is updated to either `2 * res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, or remains as `2 * res + new_cnt * (new_cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is less than 2, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `num_list` remains an empty list, and `test_cases` remains 0.**

In more detail, the `total_count` variable is incremented by the value of `cnt`. The value of `res` is updated based on whether `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 or less than 2, using the formula provided. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `num_list`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
