Output State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one value, `cnt` is decreased by 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `total_count` is increased by the original value of `cnt`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. This calculation is performed using the current value of `cnt`. After this operation, `cnt` is effectively reduced by 2 (since the formula involves `cnt - 1` and `cnt - 2`). The `total_count` is increased by the original value of `cnt` before the operation. The conditions for `num_of_lens` and the fact that `cnt` must be greater than or equal to 1 remain unchanged.
