Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head involves the following variables:
   - `cnt`: This variable is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - `num_of_lens`: This is a dictionary whose values are iterated over.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are values in `num_of_lens.values()`.

3. **Analyze the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num_of_lens` must have at least one value.
   - `cnt` is decreased by 1 if it was greater than or equal to 2.
   - `res` remains unchanged if `cnt` was less than 2, otherwise `res` is increased by either `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` or `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
   - `total_count` is increased by the original value of `cnt`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `cnt` is decreased by 1 if it was greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to continue, `cnt` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `num_of_lens` must still have at least one value.
   - `res` will be adjusted based on the new value of `cnt`.
   - `total_count` will be increased by the original value of `cnt`.

Given these points, let's construct the state for the next iteration:

- `num_of_lens` must still have at least one value.
- `cnt` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since it was decreased by 1).
- `res` will be adjusted based on the new value of `cnt`.
- `total_count` will be increased by the original value of `cnt`.

Since `num_of_lens` must have at least one value, and `cnt` must be greater than or equal to 1, the specific value of `cnt` and `res` will depend on the actual value it had before being decremented. However, we know it was decremented from a value that was initially present in `num_of_lens`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one value, `cnt` must be greater than or equal to 1, `res` will be adjusted based on the new value of `cnt`, `total_count` will be increased by the original value of `cnt`**.

To provide a concrete example, if the original `cnt` was 2, then after decrementing, `cnt` would be 1, and `res` would be adjusted accordingly. If the original `cnt` was 3, then after decrementing, `cnt` would be 2, and `res` would be adjusted accordingly.

Thus, the final state can be generalized as:

State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one value, `cnt` must be greater than or equal to 1, `res` will be adjusted based on the new value of `cnt`, `total_count` will be increased by the original value of `cnt`**.
