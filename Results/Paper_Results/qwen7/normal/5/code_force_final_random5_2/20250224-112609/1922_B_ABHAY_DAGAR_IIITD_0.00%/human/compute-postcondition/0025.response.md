Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, and `res` is 0; `total_count` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `total_count = 0` initializes the variable `total_count` to 0. This does not affect the values of `results`, `num_of_lens`, or `res`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only new information is that `total_count` is now 0.
