You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
func_1(t)

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        num_of_lens = {}
        for x in num_list:
            if x in num_of_lens:
                num_of_lens[x] += 1
            else:
                num_of_lens[x] = 1
        res = 0
        total_count = 0
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
            if cnt >= 2:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
            total_count += cnt
        results.append(res)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer \( n \) (representing the number of sticks) followed by \( n \) integers (exponents). For each tuple, it calculates a sum based on the frequency of each exponent and stores the result in a list. Finally, it prints each result from the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic in the program does not check the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 1 1 2
```

The program will output `3` because it counts all combinations of sticks, but the valid combinations are only those that satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. In this case, the valid combinations are:
- (2^0, 2^1, 2^1) -> (1, 2, 2) -> 1 way
- (2^1, 2^1, 2^1) -> (2, 2, 2) -> 1 way

So the correct output should be `2`, but the program outputs `3` because it does not properly filter out invalid combinations.
