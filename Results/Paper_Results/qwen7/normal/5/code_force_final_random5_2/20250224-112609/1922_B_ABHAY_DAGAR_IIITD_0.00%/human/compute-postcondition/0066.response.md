Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the first element in `num_list`) either has its count incremented by 1 if it was already present, or is set to 1 if it was not present before. `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, `x` is an integer in `num_list`, and `test_cases` is decremented by 1.
