Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`. The variables involved here are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop continues as long as there are values in `num_of_lens`. Since `num_of_lens` is a dictionary, it will have at least one key-value pair as per the given condition (`num_of_lens` must have at least one value).

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - `num_of_lens`: Since `num_of_lens` must have at least one value, and the loop is iterating over its values, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` still has at least one value.
   - `cnt`: This variable is being iterated over the values of `num_of_lens`. At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` was decreased by 2.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `num_of_lens` must still have at least one value.
- `cnt` must be the next value from `num_of_lens` after being decreased by 2.

Since `num_of_lens` must have at least one value, and `cnt` is the next value after being decreased by 2, we can summarize the new state as follows:

**State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one value, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens` after being decreased by 2**
