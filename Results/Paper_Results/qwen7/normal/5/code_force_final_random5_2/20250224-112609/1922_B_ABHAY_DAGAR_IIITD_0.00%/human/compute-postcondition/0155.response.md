Output State: **`total_count` is `cnt` + 2, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, `res` is now `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * (`cnt` + 1) + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `res` is updated to include the additional term.
