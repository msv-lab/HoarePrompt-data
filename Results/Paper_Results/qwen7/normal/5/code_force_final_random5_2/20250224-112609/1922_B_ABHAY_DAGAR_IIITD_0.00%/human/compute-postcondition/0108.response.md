Output State: `res` is the sum of all calculated values from the loop, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values of `cnt` from `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0.

In more detail, `res` accumulates the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` for every `cnt` that is greater than or equal to 3, and `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for every `cnt` that is greater than or equal to 2. `total_count` is incremented by each `cnt` during each iteration of the loop. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `num_list`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
