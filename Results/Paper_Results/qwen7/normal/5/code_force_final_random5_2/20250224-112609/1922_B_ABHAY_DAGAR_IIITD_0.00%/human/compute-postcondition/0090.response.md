Postcondition: `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0. This holds true whether `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 or less than 2, as the else part does not change these conditions.
