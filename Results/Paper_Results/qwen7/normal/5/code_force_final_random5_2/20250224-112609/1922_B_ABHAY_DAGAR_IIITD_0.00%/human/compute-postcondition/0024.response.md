Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, and `res` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is initialized to 0 and no operations are performed on it within the given code snippet. The `results` list and `num_of_lens` dictionary remain unchanged from their initial states. The `num_list` has been fully processed, and `num_of_lens` contains the frequency count of each integer present in `num_list`.
