Postcondition: `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, then `res` is updated to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, the values of `res`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `num_list`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
