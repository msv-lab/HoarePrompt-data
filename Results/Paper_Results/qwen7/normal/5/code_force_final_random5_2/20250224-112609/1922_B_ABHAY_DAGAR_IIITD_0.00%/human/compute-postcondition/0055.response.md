The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable when the loop variable is not needed) and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, and `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still have a positive value.

Since the loop is iterating over `range(test_cases)`, if `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. Therefore, `test_cases` must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`, and `test_cases` is decremented by 1**
