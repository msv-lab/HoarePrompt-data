Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, `res` remains unchanged if `x` was already present, otherwise `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, `total_count` remains unchanged, `num_list` remains unchanged, `x` is the next value in `num_list`, `test_cases` is decremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been incremented by 1. If `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its corresponding value is now one more than before. If `x` was not previously a key, it is now a key with a value of 1. The values of `res`, `total_count`, `num_list`, and `x` remain unchanged from their previous states. Additionally, `test_cases` has been decremented by 1.
