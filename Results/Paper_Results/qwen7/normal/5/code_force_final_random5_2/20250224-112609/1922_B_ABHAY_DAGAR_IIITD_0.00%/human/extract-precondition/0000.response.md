Precondition: **test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.**
