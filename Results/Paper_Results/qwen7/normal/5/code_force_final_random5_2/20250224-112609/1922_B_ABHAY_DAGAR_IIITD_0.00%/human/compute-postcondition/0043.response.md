Output State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one value, `cnt` is decreased by 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, and `total_count` is increased by the original value of `cnt`, `total_count` is increased by the original value of `cnt`**.

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increases the value of `total_count` by the original value of `cnt`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `cnt`, and `res`) are not directly affected by this line of code, but their states are as described in the initial postconditions.
