Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`. The variables involved here are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair.
   - `total_count` is `cnt`.
   - `num_list` is an empty list.
   - `test_cases` is 0.

3. **Determine the Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`. Each value of `cnt` comes from `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `num_of_lens` must still have at least one key-value pair, and `cnt` will be the next value from `num_of_lens`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `num_of_lens` is a dictionary and it must still have at least one key-value pair for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` still has at least one key-value pair.
   - `cnt` will be the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `num_of_lens` still has at least one key-value pair, and `cnt` will be the next value from `num_of_lens`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `cnt`, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0, `cnt` will be the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`**.
