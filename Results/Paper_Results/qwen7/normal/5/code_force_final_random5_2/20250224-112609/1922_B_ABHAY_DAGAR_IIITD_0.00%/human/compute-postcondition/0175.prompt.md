You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        num_of_lens = {}
        
        for x in num_list:
            if x in num_of_lens:
                num_of_lens[x] += 1
            else:
                num_of_lens[x] = 1
        
        res = 0
        
        total_count = 0
        
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
            if cnt >= 2:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
            total_count += cnt
        
        results.append(res)
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list will contain the sum of `res` values calculated for each test case. For each test case, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the corresponding `num_list`. The `total_count` will be the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` for that test case. The `res` variable will hold the cumulative sum of contributions calculated according to the conditions given for each test case. `n` and `test_cases` will remain as they were initialized, and `num_list` will be an empty list for each test case.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `results` list will contain one element for each test case, where each element represents the final value of `res` for that specific test case. The `num_of_lens` dictionary will store the frequency of numbers in the input lists for each test case, and `total_count` will be the sum of these frequencies. The `res` variable will accumulate the result based on the given conditions over all test cases.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The `results` list will contain the final value of `res` for each test case after all iterations of the loop have finished.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. The function returns a value based on the input tuples, but the specific return value is not detailed here.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
