Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop is iterating over `num_list` with `x` as the variable. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `num_list`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body Effects**: The loop body increments `num_of_lens[x]` by 1 if `x` was already present, otherwise it sets `num_of_lens[x]` to 1. It also updates `res` if `x` was not previously present, and `total_count` and `num_list` remain unchanged.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - Since `x` and `num_list` are the only variables in the loop head, these are the only variables that can be adjusted.
   - `num_list` is being iterated over, so `x` will change with each iteration.
   - `num_list` itself does not change within the loop; it is the source of `x` values.

Given the above points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:

- `x` will take the next value from `num_list`.
- `num_list` remains unchanged.

Since `num_list` and `x` are the only variables in the loop head, and `num_list` does not change, we only need to update `x` to the next value in `num_list`.

**State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 if `x` was already present, otherwise `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1. `res` remains unchanged if `x` was already present, otherwise `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given. `total_count` remains unchanged. `num_list` remains unchanged. `x` is the next value in `num_list`. `test_cases` is decremented by 1.**
