Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, `res` is unchanged, `total_count` is unchanged, `num_list` is unchanged, `x` is the next integer in `num_list`, and `test_cases` is decremented by 1.**

This means that the count of the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain in their previous states.
