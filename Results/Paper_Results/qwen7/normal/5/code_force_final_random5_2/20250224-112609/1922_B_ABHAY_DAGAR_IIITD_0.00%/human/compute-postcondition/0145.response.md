Postcondition: `total_count` is 0, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, `res` is either `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 if `cnt` is less than 2, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.
