Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `x` and `num_of_lens`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: 
   - For each value of `x` in `num_list`, the loop updates `num_of_lens`.
   - If `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, its count is incremented by 1.
   - If `x` is not in `num_of_lens`, it is added to `num_of_lens` with a count of 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `num_of_lens` is a set where if `x` is present, its count is increased by 1; otherwise, it is added with a count of 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will iterate over the next value of `x` in `num_list`.
   - Therefore, `x` will be the next integer in `num_list`.
   - `num_of_lens` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop has not yet processed the next value of `x`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `x` will be the next integer in `num_list`.
- `num_of_lens` will remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `x` is the next integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` is a set where if `x` is present, its count is increased by 1; otherwise, it is added with a count of 1.**
