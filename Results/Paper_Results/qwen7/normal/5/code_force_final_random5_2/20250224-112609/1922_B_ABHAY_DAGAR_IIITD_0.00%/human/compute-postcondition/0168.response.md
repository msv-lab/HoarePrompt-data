To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. The initial state only contains the line `print(result)`.
2. There are no other variables or objects explicitly defined in the initial state that would influence the value of `result`.

Given this information, the value of `result` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `result` from the provided information.

Output: **result**
