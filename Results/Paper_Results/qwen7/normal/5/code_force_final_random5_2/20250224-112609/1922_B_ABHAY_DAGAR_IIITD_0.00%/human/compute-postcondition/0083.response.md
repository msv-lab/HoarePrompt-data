Output State: **`res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `num_list` is an empty list, `test_cases` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value, which was 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3 is still valid.
