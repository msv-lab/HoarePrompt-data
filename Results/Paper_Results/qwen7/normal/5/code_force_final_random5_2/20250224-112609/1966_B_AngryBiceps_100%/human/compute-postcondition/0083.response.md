Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `a`, and `last_row` is the sum of the last elements of all sublists in `a`. The first row (`a[0]`) and the last row (`a[-1]`) are not entirely the same, or at least one of them contains more than one unique element. Additionally, the sets of the first row and the last row each contain exactly one unique element, and these two unique elements are different.
