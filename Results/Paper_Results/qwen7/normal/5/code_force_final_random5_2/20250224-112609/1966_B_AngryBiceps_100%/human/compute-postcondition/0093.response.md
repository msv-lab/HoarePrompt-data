Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n × m where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The grid is filled with 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters. For each test case, where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the function determines the number of white ('W') and black ('B') cells in the grid and returns the counts.**

This means the function indirectly accepts `t` test cases, each with a grid of size `n × m`, and returns the count of white and black cells for each grid.
