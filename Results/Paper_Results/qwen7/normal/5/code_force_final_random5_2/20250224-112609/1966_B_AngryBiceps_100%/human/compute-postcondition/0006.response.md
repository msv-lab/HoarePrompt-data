Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the value returned by `input()` to the list `a`. Since `input()` waits for user input, the list `a` now contains one element, which is the string input provided by the user. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
