Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the last element of the original input and the first element of the new input, `last_row` is increased by the last element of the new input.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments the value of `last_row` by the last element of the last sublist in the list `a`. Since `a` contains two elements and each element is a list, `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last element of the second sublist (new input). The other variables remain unchanged.
