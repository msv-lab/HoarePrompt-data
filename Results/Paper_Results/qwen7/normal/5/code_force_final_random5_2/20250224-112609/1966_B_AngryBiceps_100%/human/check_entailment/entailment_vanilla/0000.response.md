### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations. An operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and changing the color of all squares within the subrectangle defined by those two squares.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the first row and the last row are different colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color because no operation can change the color of the boundary rows.
   - Similarly, if any two adjacent rows or columns have different colors, it's also impossible to make the entire grid the same color because no operation can bridge the gap between these differently colored rows or columns.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It stores the first and last rows of the grid in `first_row` and `last_row`.
   - It checks if the first and last rows are different colors (`a[0] != a[-1]`) and if the sets of unique characters in the first and last rows are not singletons (`len(set(a[0])) != 1` or `len(set(a[-1])) != 1`). If either condition is true, it prints "NO".
   - If the conditions are not met, it prints "YES".

4. **Flaws in the Given Code**:
   - The code only checks the first and last rows, but it should check all rows and columns.
   - The logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color is incomplete. It doesn't account for the possibility of making all squares the same color if the grid has uniform rows or columns.

### Correctness:
The given code is incorrect because it fails to consider the possibility of making all squares the same color if the grid has uniform rows or columns. It only checks the first and last rows, which is insufficient.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if all rows or all columns are the same color. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if all rows are the same
        if all(row == a[0] for row in a):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Check if all columns are the same
        if all(a[row][col] == a[0][0] for row in range(n) for col in range(m)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        print('NO')

```

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
