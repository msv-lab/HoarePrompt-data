Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `a`, and `last_row` is the sum of the last elements of all sublists in `a`. The first row (`a[0]`) and the last row (`a[-1]`) are either entirely the same or both contain more than one unique element.
