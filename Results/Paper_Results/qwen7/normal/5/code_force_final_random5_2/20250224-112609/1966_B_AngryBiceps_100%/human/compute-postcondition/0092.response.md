Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input received during the corresponding iteration of the loop. The variable `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`. The variable `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in `a`. After all iterations, the conditions for printing 'NO' or 'YES' have been fully evaluated for all test cases. If any test case fails the conditions to print 'NO', it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, for all test cases that pass the conditions to print 'YES', it will print 'YES'.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the program has processed all test cases and printed 'NO' for any test case where the conditions to print 'NO' were met, and printed 'YES' for all other test cases.
