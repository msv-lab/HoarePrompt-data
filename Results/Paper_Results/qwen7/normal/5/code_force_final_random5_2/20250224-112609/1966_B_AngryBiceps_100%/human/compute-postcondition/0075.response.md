Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the original input, the second element is the original input, and the third element is the new input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the last element of the original input and the first element of the new input, `last_row` is increased by the last element of the new input**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the new input from the user to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains two elements: the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user. After appending the new input, `a` now contains three elements. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `first_row`, and `last_row`) remain unchanged.
