Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user
   - `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`
   - `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`
   - This means `i` will increment by 1 in each iteration until `i` is no longer less than `n`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 0
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0, `n` is at least 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` is the only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is now 1
   - `n` must still be greater than 0
   - `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`**
