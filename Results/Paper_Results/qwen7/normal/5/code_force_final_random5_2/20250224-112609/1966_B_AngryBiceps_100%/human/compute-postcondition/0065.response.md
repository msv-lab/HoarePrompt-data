Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution.

3. **Conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute if `n` is at least 1 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
