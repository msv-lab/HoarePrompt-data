Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments `last_row` by the value of the last element of the last element of `a`. Since `a` contains only one element which is a list (the input from the user), `a[-1]` refers to that single element, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last element of that single element. Therefore, `last_row` is updated to be its original value plus the last element of the last element of `a`.
