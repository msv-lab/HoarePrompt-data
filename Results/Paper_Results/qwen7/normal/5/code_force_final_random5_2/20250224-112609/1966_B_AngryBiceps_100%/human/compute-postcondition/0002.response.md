Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space; `a` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
