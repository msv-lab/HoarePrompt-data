Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the input integer.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the corresponding input from the user.
- `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of all elements in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is the concatenation of the last characters of all elements in the list `a`.
- The first element of `a` and the last element of `a` either do not consist of a single unique character or they are the same.
- The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, the length of the set of characters in `last_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
