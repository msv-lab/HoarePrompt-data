Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `first_row` and the second element is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to `first_row + a[-1][0]`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates `first_row` by adding `a[-1][0]` to its current value. Since `a[-1][0]` is the first element of the last element of `a`, `first_row` is updated to be its original value plus this element. The other variables remain unchanged.
