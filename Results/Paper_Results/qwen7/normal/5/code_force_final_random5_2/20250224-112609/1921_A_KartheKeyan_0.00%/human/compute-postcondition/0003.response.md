Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of \((l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2\) for each test case, and we have processed \(t-1\) test cases; `coord` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `coord`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, or `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
