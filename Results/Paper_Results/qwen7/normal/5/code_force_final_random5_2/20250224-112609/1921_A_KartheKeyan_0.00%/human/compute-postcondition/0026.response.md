Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still 3.
