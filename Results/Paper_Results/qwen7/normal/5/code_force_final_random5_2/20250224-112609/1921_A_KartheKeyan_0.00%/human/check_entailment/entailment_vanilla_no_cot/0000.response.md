Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in calculating the area of the square. The approach used to calculate `p1` and `p2` does not correctly identify the side length of the square. Instead, it calculates the squared distance between two arbitrary points, which does not necessarily correspond to the side length of the square.

To fix this, we need to correctly identify the pairs of points that form the sides of the square. Given that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the differences in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates between the points will give us the side length directly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Find the differences in x and y coordinates
        x_diffs = [abs(coord[i][0] - coord[(i+1) % 4][0]) for i in range(4)]
        y_diffs = [abs(coord[i][1] - coord[(i+1) % 4][1]) for i in range(4)]
        
        # Since it's a square, both differences should be equal
        side_length = min(x_diffs)
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        
        n -= 1

func()
```

This corrected program properly identifies the side length of the square by finding the differences in x and y coordinates between adjacent points and then calculates the area correctly.
