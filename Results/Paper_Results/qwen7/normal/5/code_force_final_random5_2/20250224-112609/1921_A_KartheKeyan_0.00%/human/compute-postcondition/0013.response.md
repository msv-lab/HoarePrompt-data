Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer; `coord` is a list containing three tuples: ((1, `y`), (`x`, `y`), (2, `y`)).**

The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains two tuples: ((1, `y`), (`x`, `y`)). After appending `(x, y)`, `coord` now contains three tuples: ((1, `y`), (`x`, `y`), (2, `y`)). The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
