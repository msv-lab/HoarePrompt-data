Output State: **`coord` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (x, y), the second tuple is (x, y), and the third tuple is (x, y); `i` is 3; `x` is the first integer from the input split; `y` is the second integer from the input split; `coord` is sorted based on the tuples.**

Explanation: The code `coord = sorted(coord)` sorts the list `coord` based on the tuples it contains. Since `coord` initially contains three identical tuples `(x, y)`, sorting them does not change their order. Therefore, the list remains as `[ (x, y), (x, y), (x, y) ]`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their last updated values during the loop iterations.
