Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split value, `y` is an input integer from the third split value, `coord` is an empty list, `p2` is 1, `res` is 0, and `n` must be non-zero.**

The code `coord = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `coord`. This operation changes the value of `coord` from a list containing four tuples to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.
