Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.
3. The coordinates are stored in a list called `coord`.
4. The coordinates are sorted, which is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness since the relative positions of the points will be preserved regardless of sorting.
5. The program then calculates the distances between two pairs of opposite corners of the square using the Euclidean distance formula.
6. These distances are squared and multiplied together to get the area of the square.
7. The absolute value is taken to ensure the result is non-negative, although this step is redundant because the distances are always positive.
8. Finally, the calculated area is printed, and the process repeats for the next test case until all test cases are processed.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program logic appears to be correct for calculating the area of the square. The approach of calculating the distances between opposite corners and multiplying them to get the area is valid for squares with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Correctness: **True**
