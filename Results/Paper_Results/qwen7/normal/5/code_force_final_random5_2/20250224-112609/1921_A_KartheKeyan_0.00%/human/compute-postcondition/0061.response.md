Output State: **`coord` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (x, y), the second tuple is (x, y), and the third tuple is (x, y); `i` is 2; `p1` is the squared distance between the second and the first points in `coord`; `p2` is the squared distance between the fourth and the third points in `coord`; `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decremented by 1, but since `n` was not explicitly defined or used in the initial state, we assume it was a typo or redundant reference. The only affected variable is `i`, which is decremented from 3 to 2. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
