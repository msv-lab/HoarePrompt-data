Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an input integer from the second split value; `y` is an input integer from the second split value; `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 1. The list `coord` is updated to contain a tuple `(x, y)` with the new values of `x` and `y`.
