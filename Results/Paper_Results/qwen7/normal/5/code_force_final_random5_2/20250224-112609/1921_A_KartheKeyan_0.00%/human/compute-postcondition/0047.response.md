Output State: **`coord` is a list containing a tuple (x, y), where x and y are integers from the input split, `x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `x` and `y` are integers from the input split, they remain unchanged. The list `coord` now contains this new tuple along with any previously added tuples.
