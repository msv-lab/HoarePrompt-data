Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split value, `y` is an input integer from the third split value, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: ((1, `y`), (`x`, `y`), (2, `y`), (3, `y`)), and `p1` is (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])**2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])**2.**

Explanation: The code calculates the distance squared between the first two points in the `coord` list. The first point is `(1, y)` and the second point is `(x, y)`. Since both points have the same `y` coordinate, the distance squared simplifies to `(x - 1)**2`. Therefore, `p1` is set to `(x - 1)**2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
