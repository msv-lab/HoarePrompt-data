Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to calculate the area of the square by sorting the coordinates and then calculating the distances between certain points. However, this approach does not guarantee that the calculated distances correspond to the side lengths of the square. Specifically, the program calculates the squared Euclidean distance between two points and multiplies the square roots of these distances to get the area, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the side length of the square. Given that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the maximum difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates among the four points. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Find the maximum differences in x and y coordinates
        max_diff_x = max(coord)[0] - min(coord)[0]
        max_diff_y = max(coord, key=lambda point: point[1])[1] - min(coord, key=lambda point: point[1])[1]
        
        # The side length of the square is the maximum of these differences
        side_length = max(max_diff_x, max_diff_y)
        
        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        
        n -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the side length is accurately determined and the area is correctly calculated.
