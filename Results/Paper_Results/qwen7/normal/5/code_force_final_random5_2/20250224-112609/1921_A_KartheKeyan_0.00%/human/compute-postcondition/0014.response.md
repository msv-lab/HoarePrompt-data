Output State: `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split value, `y` is an input integer from the third split value, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, `y`), (`x`, `y`), (2, `y`), (3, `y`).

This means after the loop has executed all 4 iterations, the variable `i` will be 3, indicating it has gone through the loop 4 times. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values from the fourth input pair. The list `coord` will contain four tuples, each representing a pair of coordinates entered by the user, in the order they were provided.
