Reasoning:
1. The annotated program has a few issues that need to be addressed:
   - The `func_1` function checks if the list is already sorted, but it does not attempt to sort the list using the specified operations.
   - The main loop does not correctly implement the described operation. It only checks if the list is sorted without performing the necessary operations to potentially sort the list.
   - There is no implementation of the operation described in the problem statement within the loop.

2. The core issue is that the program does not actually perform the operations to transform the list into a sorted one. Instead, it simply checks if the list is already sorted, which does not address the problem requirements.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
