Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1` is not defined**: The function `func_1` is referenced in the main loop but is never defined in the code snippet provided. This will cause a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect logic for the operation**: The operation described in the problem involves splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits and inserting those digits back into the array. However, the code does not implement this logic correctly. It simply checks if the list is sorted without performing the required operations.

3. **Misplaced operations**: The operations to split elements and insert digits are not correctly implemented. The code attempts to split and insert digits directly within the loop, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

4. **Sorting check is premature**: The sorting check (`func_1(list1)`) is done before any operations are performed, which means it will always return `False` because the operations are not applied.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
- Implement the logic to split elements that are at least 10 into their digits.
- Insert these digits back into the array.
- Repeat the process until the array is sorted or it is determined that sorting is impossible.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    while True:
        sorted_list = sorted(list1)
        if list1 == sorted_list:
            print('Yes')
            break
        
        changed = False
        for j in range(n):
            if list1[j] >= 10:
                a = list1[j]
                list1.pop(j)
                list1.insert(j, a // 10)
                list1.insert(j + 1, a % 10)
                changed = True
                break
        
        if not changed:
            print('No')
            break
```

This version correctly implements the logic to split elements and insert digits, and it checks if the array is sorted after each operation. If the array becomes sorted, it prints 'Yes'. If no changes can be made to sort the array, it prints 'No'.
