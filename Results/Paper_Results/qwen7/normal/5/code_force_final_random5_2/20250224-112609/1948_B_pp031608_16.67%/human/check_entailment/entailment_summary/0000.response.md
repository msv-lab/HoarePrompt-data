Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to sort the array by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits.
2. However, the program has a few issues:
   - The `func_1` function checks if the list is sorted but does not actually perform any sorting operations. It should be used to verify if the array is sorted after the operations.
   - The logic inside the loop that splits elements is flawed. It only checks if the previous element is greater than the current one and the previous element is greater than 10, then splits the previous element. This is insufficient because it doesn't handle all cases where splitting could help in sorting the array.
   - The program does not guarantee that the array will be sorted after performing the operations. It only checks once after potentially performing multiple operations, which might not be enough.
   - There is no mechanism to ensure that the array will eventually become sorted through the operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations.

Correctness: **False**
