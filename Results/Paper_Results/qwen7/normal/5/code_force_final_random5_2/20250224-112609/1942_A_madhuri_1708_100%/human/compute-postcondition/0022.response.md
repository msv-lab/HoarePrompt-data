Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `s` is a string that contains two parts separated by spaces.
   - `n` is the integer obtained from the first part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.
   - `k` is the integer obtained from the second part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then either `n` equals `k` or `n` does not equal `k`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The expression `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Adding `1` to each number in this sequence results in a list of numbers from `1` to `n`.
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the list into separate arguments for the `print` function.
   - Therefore, the `print` function will print the numbers from `1` to `n` separated by spaces.

4. **Determine `n`**:
   - Since `n` is the integer obtained from the first part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer, `n` is a positive integer.
   - The exact value of `n` depends on the string `s`, but it must be a positive integer.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The output will be the numbers from `1` to `n` separated by spaces.

Given the above analysis, the precise output can be described as follows:

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the integer obtained from the first part of s split by spaces and converted to an integer)**
