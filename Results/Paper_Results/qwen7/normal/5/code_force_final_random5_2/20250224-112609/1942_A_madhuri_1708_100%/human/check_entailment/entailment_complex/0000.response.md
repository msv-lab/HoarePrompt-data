Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of its \(n\) cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. The provided solution handles different cases based on the value of \(k\):
   - If \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(n = k\), it prints a list with \(k\) occurrences of \(k\). This ensures that all \(n\) cyclic shifts are sorted because every element is the same.
     - Otherwise, it prints \(-1\) because it's impossible to have exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts when \(n \neq k\).
   - If \(k < 2\), it prints a list with \(n\) occurrences of integers starting from 1 up to \(n\). This ensures that only one cyclic shift (the original array itself) is sorted.
3. The logic aligns with the problem statement and examples provided:
   - For the first test case (2 2), it correctly prints `[2, 2]` since both cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - For the second test case (3 1), it correctly prints `[1, 2, 3]` since only the original array is sorted.
   - For the third test case (3 2), it correctly prints `-1` because it's impossible to have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts for \(n = 3\).

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
