Output State: The loop will continue to read lines from standard input until there are no more lines to read. For each line, it will parse `n` and `k` as integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop will check if `n` equals `k`. If they are equal, it will print a list with `k` occurrences of `k`. If `n` does not equal `k`, it will print `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it will print a list with `n` occurrences of integers starting from 1 up to `n`.

The final output state will be determined by all the lines processed by the loop. Each line processed will contribute to the output based on the conditions specified in the loop body. If the end of the input is reached, the loop will terminate, and the output will consist of all the printed lists from each iteration.
