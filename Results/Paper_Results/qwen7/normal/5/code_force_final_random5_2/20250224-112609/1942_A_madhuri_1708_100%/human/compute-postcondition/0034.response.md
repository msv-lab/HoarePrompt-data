Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each `t`, two integers `n` and `k` are given such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^3. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing values for `t`, `n`, and `k`. It processes these values according to the specified constraints and returns a result for each test case based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.
