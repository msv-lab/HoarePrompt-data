You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to read lines from standard input until there are no more lines to read. For each line, it will parse `n` and `k` as integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop will check if `n` equals `k`. If they are equal, it will print a list with `k` occurrences of `k`. If `n` does not equal `k`, it will print `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it will print a list with `n` occurrences of integers starting from 1 up to `n`.
    #
    #The final output state will be determined by all the lines processed by the loop. Each line processed will contribute to the output based on the conditions specified in the loop body. If the end of the input is reached, the loop will terminate, and the output will consist of all the printed lists from each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of `n` cyclic shifts of `a` are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `k >= 2`, it checks specific conditions:
     - If `n == k`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
   - If `k < 2`, it prints numbers from `1` to `n`.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when `k == n` by printing `k` repeated `k` times.
   - However, it does not handle other cases where `k` can be 1 or less than `k` but not equal to `n`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `k == 1`, the program prints numbers from `1` to `n`. This is incorrect because it doesn't ensure exactly one cyclic shift is sorted.
   - When `k > 1` and `n != k`, the program prints `-1`, which is also incorrect because there can be arrays with more than one sorted cyclic shift.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - For `k == 1`, we need to construct an array where only one cyclic shift is sorted.
   - For `k > 1` and `n != k`, we need to construct an array where exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
