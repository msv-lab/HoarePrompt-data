Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. The provided solution handles different cases based on the value of \(k\):
   - If \(k \geq 2\), it checks if \(n = k\). If true, it prints a list with \(k\) occurrences of \(k\). Otherwise, it prints \(-1\).
   - If \(k < 2\), it prints a list with \(n\) occurrences of integers starting from 1 up to \(n\).

3. Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:
   - When \(k \geq 2\) and \(n = k\):
     - The array can be constructed as \([k, k, \ldots, k]\). All cyclic shifts of this array are sorted because every element is the same.
     - This meets the requirement of having exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts.
   - When \(k \geq 2\) and \(n \neq k\):
     - No such array exists because having \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts would imply that the array must be constant (all elements equal), but this contradicts the requirement that \(n \neq k\).
     - Hence, printing \(-1\) is correct.
   - When \(k < 2\):
     - The array \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) has only one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).
     - This meets the requirement of having exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts when \(k = 1\).
     - However, when \(k = 0\), no such array exists, and the solution correctly prints \(-1\).

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly handles all cases as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
