Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the integer obtained from the first part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.
- `k` is the integer obtained from the second part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.
- If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then either `n` equals `k` or `n` does not equal `k`.

The `print('-1')` statement directly prints the string `-1` without any dependency on the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **-1**
