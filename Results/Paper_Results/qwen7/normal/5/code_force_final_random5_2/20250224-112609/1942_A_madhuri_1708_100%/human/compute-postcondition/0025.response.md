Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is the integer obtained from the first part of the next line of input split by spaces and converted to an integer; `k` is the integer obtained from the second part of the next line of input split by spaces and converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, s.split())` takes a string `s` as input, splits it into parts using spaces, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state.
