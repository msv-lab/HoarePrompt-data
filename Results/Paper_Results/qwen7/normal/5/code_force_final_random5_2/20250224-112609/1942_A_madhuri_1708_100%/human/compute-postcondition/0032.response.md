Output State: The loop will continue to read lines from standard input until there are no more lines to read. For each line, it will parse `n` and `k` as integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, it will check if `n` equals `k`. If they are equal, it will print a list containing `k` elements, each being `k`. If `n` does not equal `k`, it will print `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it will print a list containing the integers from 1 to `n`.

In summary, the final output state will consist of multiple lines, each representing the result of processing one line of input according to the rules described above, until all input lines have been processed.
