Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the integer obtained from the first part of the next line of input split by spaces and converted to an integer.
- `k` is the integer obtained from the second part of the next line of input split by spaces and converted to an integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(*[k for j in range(k)])
```

This code creates a list comprehension that generates a list with `k` occurrences of the value `k`. The `*` operator is used to unpack this list so that it is printed as separate elements.

Given the initial state, the value of `k` is an integer obtained from the second part of the next line of input. Let's denote this integer as `input_k`.

Therefore, the list comprehension `[k for j in range(k)]` will generate a list with `input_k` occurrences of `input_k`.

The `print(*...)` statement will then print these elements separated by spaces.

Output: **input_k input_k ... input_k (input_k times)**
