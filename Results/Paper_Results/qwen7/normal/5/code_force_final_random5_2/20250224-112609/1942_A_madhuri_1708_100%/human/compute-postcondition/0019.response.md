Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is the integer obtained from the first part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.
   - `k` is the integer obtained from the second part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then either `n` equals `k` or `n` does not equal `k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*[k for j in range(k)])
   ```

   This line of code creates a list comprehension that generates a list with `k` occurrences of `k`, and then prints this list using the `*` operator, which unpacks the list into separate arguments for the `print` function.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `k` is an integer and it must be greater than or equal to 2 (as per the condition), the list comprehension `[k for j in range(k)]` will generate a list with `k` elements, each being `k`.
   - For example, if `k` is 2, the list would be `[2, 2]`.
   - If `k` is 3, the list would be `[3, 3, 3]`.
   - And so on.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will print the list generated by the list comprehension, with each element being `k`.

Given the above analysis, the output will be a list of `k` elements, each being `k`.

Output: **[k, k, ..., k] (a list with k elements, each being k)**
