Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is the integer obtained from the first part of the next line of input split by spaces and converted to an integer; `k` is the integer obtained from the second part of the next line of input split by spaces and converted to an integer. If `n` equals `k`, the program does not change these values. If `n` does not equal `k`, the program also does not change these values.**
