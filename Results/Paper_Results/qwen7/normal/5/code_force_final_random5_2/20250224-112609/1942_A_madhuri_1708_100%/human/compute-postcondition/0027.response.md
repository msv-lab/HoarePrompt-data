Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the integer obtained from the first part of the next line of input split by spaces and converted to an integer.
- `k` is the integer obtained from the second part of the next line of input split by spaces and converted to an integer.

The `print('-1')` statement directly outputs the string `-1` without referencing any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `k`.

Output: **-1**
