Postcondition: `count` is 2, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `i` is 2, `num` is `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1`, and if `num` equals 1, then `count` is incremented by 1.
