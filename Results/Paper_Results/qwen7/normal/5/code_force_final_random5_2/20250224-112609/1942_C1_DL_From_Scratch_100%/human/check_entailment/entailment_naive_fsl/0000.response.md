Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to count the number of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and adds these to the number of chosen vertices minus 2 to determine the number of triangles. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of forming triangles using the edges of the polygon itself, which is a valid way to form triangles without additional vertices.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```

The program's output for this case is `2`, but the correct output should be `3`. Hereâ€™s why:

- The chosen vertices are 1, 2, 5, and 6.
- By connecting these vertices with diagonals, we can form the following triangles:
  - Triangle formed by vertices 1, 2, and 5.
  - Triangle formed by vertices 2, 5, and 6.
  - Triangle formed by vertices 1, 6, and 2 (using the edges of the polygon).

The program fails to account for the third triangle formed by the edges of the polygon, leading to an incorrect count. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
