Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, `count` is incremented by 1 if `num` equals 1, and `n`, `x`, `y` are integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial values and conditions of `i`, `num`, `count`, and `T` remain unchanged.
