Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `count` is equal to `x`.
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `x` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - `list0` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `i` is `x-2`.
   - `num` is calculated as `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`.

2. **Condition for updating `count`:**
   - If `num` equals 1, then `count` is updated to `x`.

3. **Print statement:**
   - The statement to be executed is `print(count + x - 2)`.

Now, let's determine the value of `count + x - 2`:

- Since `count` is equal to `x`, we have `count = x`.
- We need to find the value of `num` to see if it affects `count`.

Given:
- `num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `list0`, `n`, and `list0[0]` and `list0[-1]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `num`. However, the problem states that if `num` equals 1, then `count` is updated to `x`. This means that `count` remains `x` unless `num` equals 1, but since no specific conditions are given to make `num` equal to 1, we assume `count` remains `x`.

Therefore, the expression `count + x - 2` simplifies to:
- `x + x - 2 = 2x - 2`.

So, the print statement will output `2x - 2`.

Output: **2x - 2**
