Postcondition: `count` is equal to `x`, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `i` is `x-2`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, and if `num` equals 1, then `count` is updated to `x`.
