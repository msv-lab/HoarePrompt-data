### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code against the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The program should determine the year in which all \( n \) signs will occur sequentially.
- For each sign, the tribe waits for the next sign to occur strictly after the previous one.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

#### Key Points to Evaluate:
1. **Initialization**: `start_year` is initialized to 0.
2. **Loop through each sign**: For each sign, the program updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

#### Correctness of the Formula:
- The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is intended to find the next occurrence of the sign after the previous one. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly handle the sequential nature of the problem.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the example input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

- **First Sign**: The first sign occurs in year 3.
- **Second Sign**: The second sign should occur after year 3, but the formula will compute the next occurrence based on the previous `start_year` (which is 0 initially). It will compute `(0 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`, which is incorrect.
- **Third Sign**: Similarly, the third sign will incorrectly compute its occurrence.

This indicates that the program is not correctly handling the sequential waiting periods as required by the problem.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
The annotated code states that the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all periodicities, which is incorrect. The LCM approach does not account for the sequential waiting periods.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The formula used in the program does not follow the sequential waiting periods as described in the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
