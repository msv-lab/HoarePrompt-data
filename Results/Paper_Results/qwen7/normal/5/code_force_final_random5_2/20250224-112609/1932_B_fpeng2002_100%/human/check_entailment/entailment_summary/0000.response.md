Reasoning:
- The provided program aims to calculate the year in which all signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially.
- For each test case, the program initializes `start_year` to 0 and then iterates over the list of periodicities (`nums`). In each iteration, it updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
- This formula ensures that `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`, effectively advancing `start_year` to the next occurrence of the current sign after the previous sign has occurred.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each one independently.
- The final value of `start_year` printed is the result for the last test case, but since the program updates `start_year` for each sign in sequence, this approach should yield the correct year for the last sign in each test case.

Given the logic and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct in its approach to solving the problem.

Correctness: **True**
