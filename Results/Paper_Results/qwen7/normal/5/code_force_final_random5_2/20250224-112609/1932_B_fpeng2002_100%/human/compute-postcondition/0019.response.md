Output State: **`num_tests` is exactly 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` by splitting the input string (which is expected to contain space-separated integers) into individual elements and converting each element to an integer. The original values of `num_tests` and `n` remain unchanged.
