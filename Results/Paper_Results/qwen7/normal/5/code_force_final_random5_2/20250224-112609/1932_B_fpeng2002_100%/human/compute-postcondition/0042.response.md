Output State: `start_year` is equal to `(((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`, `x` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`, `num_tests` is equal to `num_tests - 3`, and `nums` must be a non-empty list.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be updated to the final value calculated by successively applying the formula within the loop for each element in `nums`. The variable `x` will be equal to the last index of `nums`, `num_tests` will be reduced by the total number of iterations (which is 3 in this case), and `nums` must still be a non-empty list.
