Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `x` as the variable iterating over the range from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start_year` is equal to `(0 // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - `x` is currently `0`.
   - `num_tests` is equal to `num_tests - 1`.
   - `nums` must be a non-empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` starts at `0` and the loop iterates over `range(0, len(nums))`, the next value of `x` will be `1`.
   - Therefore, `x` needs to be updated to `1`.
   - The other variables (`start_year` and `num_tests`) are not directly affected by the loop itself but might change inside the loop body. However, since no specific changes are mentioned, we assume they remain unchanged for now.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `x` must be less than `len(nums)`, and since `x` is being incremented, it will continue until `x` reaches `len(nums)`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `start_year` remains the same unless modified inside the loop.
   - `x` is updated to `1`.
   - `num_tests` remains `num_tests - 1` unless modified inside the loop.
   - `nums` must still be a non-empty list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`start_year` is equal to `(0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, `x` is 1, `num_tests` is equal to `num_tests - 1`, and `nums` must be a non-empty list**.
