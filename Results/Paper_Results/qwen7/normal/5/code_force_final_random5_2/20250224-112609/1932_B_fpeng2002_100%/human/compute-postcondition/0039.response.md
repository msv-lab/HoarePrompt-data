Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined by the variable `x` in the range `0` to `len(nums)`. Therefore, the only variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `start_year` is calculated based on the initial values of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`.
   - `x` is currently `1`.
   - `num_tests` is reduced by `1` at the end of each iteration.
   - `nums` must be a non-empty list.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `x` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be `2`.
   - `num_tests` is reduced by `1` at the end of each iteration, so it will be `num_tests - 1 - 1 = num_tests - 2`.
   - `nums` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `start_year` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `x` will be `2`.
- `num_tests` will be `num_tests - 2`.
- `nums` remains a non-empty list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`start_year` is equal to `(0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `x` is 2, `num_tests` is equal to `num_tests - 2`, and `nums` must be a non-empty list.**
