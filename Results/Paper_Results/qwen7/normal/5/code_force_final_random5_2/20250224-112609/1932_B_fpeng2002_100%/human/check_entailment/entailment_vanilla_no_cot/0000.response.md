Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining when each subsequent sign will occur is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The current implementation calculates `start_year` as `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which does not correctly find the next occurrence of the sign after the previous one. This approach assumes that the current `start_year` is already aligned with the previous sign's occurrences, which is not necessarily true.

2. **Logic for Sequential Occurrences**: To find the year when the next sign will occur, you need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities up to the current sign. The LCM ensures that all previous signs have occurred and the current sign will be the next one to occur.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        # Calculate the LCM of all periodicities
        result = reduce(lcm, nums)
        
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version uses the `reduce` function to compute the LCM of all the periodicities, ensuring that the year when all signs will occur is calculated correctly.
