Output State: **`start_year` is `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers, `x` is 0**.

Explanation: The value of `start_year` is updated to `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`. Since `x` is 0, the code uses the first element of the list `nums` for the calculation. The length of `nums` must be at least 1, and `x` remains 0.
