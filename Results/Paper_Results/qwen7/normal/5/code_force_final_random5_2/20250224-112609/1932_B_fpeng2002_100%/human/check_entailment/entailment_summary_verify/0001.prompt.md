You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a value `start_year` by successively applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the list `nums`. After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of `start_year` for the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0. This variable is supposed to track the current year when the last sign occurred.

3. **Loop Through Signs:**
   - The program iterates through each sign's periodicity.
   - For each periodicity `nums[x]`, it updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

4. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is intended to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
   - However, this formula does not correctly handle the sequential waiting period for the signs. It only finds the next multiple of the current periodicity without considering the cumulative effect of previous signs.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of all periodicities. The LCM will give us the smallest year in which all signs will occur sequentially.
   - The given formula does not account for the sequential nature of the signs. Instead, it only considers the periodicity of the current sign without updating the cumulative effect of previous signs.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
