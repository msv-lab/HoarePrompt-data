Output State: **`start_year` is `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The variable `start_year` is updated to the value of `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. The value of `nums` remains unchanged, and it is still a list of integers with at least one element. The value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so it is assumed to be an index within the bounds of the list `nums`.
