Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, the second last element of `arr` is 0, `pos` is 1, `z_r` is decreased by 1**.

The code `z_r -= 1` decreases the value of `z_r` by 1. Since `z_l` was increased by 1 in the initial state, and no other changes were made to `z_r`, the only change is that `z_r` is now decreased by 1. All other variables remain in their initial conditions except for `z_r`.
