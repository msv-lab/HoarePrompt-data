Postcondition: `i` is the third element of the list `arr`, `pos` is 4, `z_r` is -1, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1, the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true, the condition `z_l >= (z_l + 1) / 2` is true, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `ans` is 3, and either `z_l` is increased by 1 or `o_r` is decreased by 1, and `b_d` is 3.
