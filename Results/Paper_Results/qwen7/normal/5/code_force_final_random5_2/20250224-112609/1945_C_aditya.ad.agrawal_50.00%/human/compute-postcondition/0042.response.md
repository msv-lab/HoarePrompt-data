Output State: **`i` is the second element of the list `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is 1 less than before, the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true, the condition `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` is true, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `ans` is 1, `o_l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `o_r -= 1` decreases the value of `o_r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
