Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans` + 2, `o_r` is 0, `z_r` is 1, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - (ans + 1))`, and the condition `(o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - (ans + 1))))` is true.**

Explanation: The variable `z_l` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `pos` was initially equal to `ans` + 1, after incrementing `z_l`, `pos` becomes `ans` + 2. All other conditions and values remain as they were in the initial state.
