Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the second last element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, `o_r` is 0.**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the second last element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, and `o_r` is 1. The code snippet `o_r -= 1` decrements the value of `o_r` by 1. Since `o_r` was initially 1, after executing the code, `o_r` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
