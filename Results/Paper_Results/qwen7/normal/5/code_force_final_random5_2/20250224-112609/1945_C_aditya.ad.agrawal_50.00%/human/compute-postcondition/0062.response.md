The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decreased by 1, so `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is the last element of the list `arr`, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `-z` (since `z` zeros are processed and `z_l` is updated accordingly), `o_r` is equal to `-o` (since `o` ones are processed and `o_l` is updated accordingly), `b_d` remains 3, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` was last satisfied before `pos` reached the length of `arr`, `t` must be greater than 0**
