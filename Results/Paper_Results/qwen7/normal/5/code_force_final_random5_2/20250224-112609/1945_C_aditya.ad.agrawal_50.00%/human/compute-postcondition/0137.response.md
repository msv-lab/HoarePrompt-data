Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `pos` is increased by 1 (now `pos` is 2), and `z_l` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `z_l` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. The variable `pos` is also mentioned to be increased by 1, and since the initial value of `pos` was increased by 1, it now equals 2. The precondition that `arr` must have at least one element remains unchanged.
