Output State: **`i` is the last element of the list `arr`, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `-z` (since `z` zeros are processed and `z_l` is updated accordingly), `o_r` is equal to `-o` (since `o` ones are processed and `o_l` is updated accordingly), `b_d` remains 3, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` was last satisfied before `pos` reached the length of `arr`, `t` is decreased by 1.**

In simpler terms, after executing the line `t -= 1`, the value of `t` is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
