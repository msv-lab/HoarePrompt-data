Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in arr`. The variables involved here are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `arr`**:
   - `i` is initially set to the last element of the list `arr`.
   - `arr` is a list of elements.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `arr`.
   - The initial value of `i` is the last element of `arr`, so the loop will start with this value.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is the last element of `arr`, the loop will start with `i` being the last element.
   - `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `input_string`, `pos`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `b_d`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `o_l`, `o`, `z_l` are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `arr` must have at least one element.
- `i` is the last element of `arr`.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`**.
