Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0.**

This means that the variable `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, and `o_l` retain their initial states. The new variables `dist`, `ans`, and `pos` are introduced and initialized as follows: `dist` is set to the absolute value of `n` divided by 2, `ans` is set to 0, and `pos` is set to 0.
