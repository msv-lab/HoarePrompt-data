Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the second-to-last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans` + 1, `o_r` is 0 or -2, `z_r` is either 0 or 1, `b_d` is recalculated as `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `o_l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `o_r -= 1` decreases the value of `o_r` by 1. Since `o_r` was either 0 or -1 initially, after executing the code, `o_r` will be 0 or -2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
