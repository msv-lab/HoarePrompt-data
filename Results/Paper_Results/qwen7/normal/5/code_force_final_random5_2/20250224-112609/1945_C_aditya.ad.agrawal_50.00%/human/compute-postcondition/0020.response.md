Output State: **`i` is the first element of the list `arr`; `pos` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially set to be the first element of the list `arr`, its value remains unchanged. The new value of `pos` is 1, indicating that one position has been moved forward from the start of the list.
