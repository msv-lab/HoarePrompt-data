Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a valid permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Specifically, the program attempts to fill the permutation \( p \) in reverse order, which can lead to invalid permutations. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

For the input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

The expected output is:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

However, the program generates:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

This looks correct at first glance, but let's verify the MEX values:
- \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 \)
- \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1]) - 1 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = -2 \)
- \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 1 \)
- \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 2 \)

These values match the given \( a \), but the issue arises when we consider other valid permutations. For instance, another valid permutation could be:
```
0 1 3 2 4
```

For this permutation:
- \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 \)
- \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1]) - 1 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 3]) - 3 = -2 \)
- \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 3, 2]) - 2 = 1 \)
- \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 3, 2, 4]) - 4 = 2 \)

Both permutations satisfy the conditions, but the provided program only outputs one of them, which might not be the intended solution. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee generating all possible valid permutations.
