Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A list `p` of size `n` initialized with `-1` is created.
   - A variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which represents the minimum non-negative integer not present in the current permutation.

3. **Backward Construction:**
   - The loop iterates backward from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each index `i`, it sets `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The constructed permutation `p` is printed.

### Reasoning:

1. **Backward Construction Logic:**
   - The logic in the loop is designed to construct the permutation `p` such that `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.
   - By iterating backward, we ensure that the `MEX` calculation is done correctly for each position `i`.

2. **Handling `MEX`:**
   - The `mex` variable is used to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current permutation.
   - When setting `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, we are ensuring that the value placed at `p[i]` is consistent with the definition of `a_i`.

3. **Updating `mex`:**
   - After placing `p[i]`, updating `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` ensures that `mex` reflects the correct minimum non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The problem guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists for the given constraints.
   - The program handles this by ensuring that the values placed in `p` are valid and consistent with the `MEX` condition.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
