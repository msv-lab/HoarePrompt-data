Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Each element \( a_i \) is defined as the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) of the prefix \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \) minus \( p_i \).

2. **Analyze the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes a list \( p \) with -1 for each position.
   - It iterates backward from \( n-1 \) to 0, setting each \( p[i] \) to \( \text{mex} - a[i] \).
   - It updates \( \text{mex} \) to be the minimum value in the current list \( p \).

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - The backward iteration ensures that \( \text{mex} \) is correctly updated based on the current state of \( p \).
   - The calculation \( p[i] = \text{mex} - a[i] \) should ensure that \( p[i] \) is a valid element of the permutation and fits the MEX definition.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The code handles the constraints correctly and ensures that \( p \) is a permutation of \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).
   - The backward iteration guarantees that each \( p[i] \) is set before it is used to update \( \text{mex} \).

Given these points, the code appears to correctly implement the logic to construct a valid permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).

Correctness: **True**
