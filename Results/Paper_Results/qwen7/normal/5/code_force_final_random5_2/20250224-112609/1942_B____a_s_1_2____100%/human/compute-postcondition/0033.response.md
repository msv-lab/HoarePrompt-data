Output State: `t` must be equal to `n`, `i` is `t - n`, `n` is the same, `mex` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and all elements in the list `p`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`, `a` remains unchanged, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be `-1` (since `i` starts from `t-1` and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches `-1`), `mex` will hold the minimum value among all elements in the list `p`, and `p` will be updated such that each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`.
