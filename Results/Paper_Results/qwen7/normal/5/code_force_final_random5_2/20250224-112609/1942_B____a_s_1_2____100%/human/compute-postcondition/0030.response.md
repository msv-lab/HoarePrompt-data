Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is `t - 3`, `n` is the same, `mex` retains its value, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`, `a` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Given that `i` is `t - 3`, `n` is the same, `mex` retains its value, and `a` remains unchanged, the only change is that `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`.
