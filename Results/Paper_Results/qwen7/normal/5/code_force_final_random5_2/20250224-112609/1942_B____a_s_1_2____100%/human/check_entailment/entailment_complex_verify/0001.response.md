### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) of the permutation and the array \( a \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes a list `p` of size \( n \) with all elements set to `-1`.
   - It also initializes `mex` (minimum excluded value) to \( n \).

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The loop runs from \( n-1 \) to \( 0 \). For each index \( i \):
     - It sets \( p[i] \) to \( \text{mex} - a[i] \).
     - It updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly assigned value of \( p[i] \).

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the constructed permutation \( p \).

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The goal is to ensure that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
  - By setting \( p[i] = \text{mex} - a[i] \), the program ensures that the MEX condition is satisfied.
  - However, the critical issue lies in how `mex` is updated. The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` is problematic because it can lead to incorrect values of `mex`.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Problem with `mex` Update:**
  - When `p[i]` is assigned a value, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This means `mex` can become smaller than the actual minimum excluded value.
  - Consider the following example:
    - Suppose `a = [1, 1, 1]`.
    - Initially, `mex = 3`.
    - For \( i = 2 \): `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, so `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
    - For \( i = 1 \): `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, so `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`.
    - For \( i = 0 \): `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, so `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.
    - The resulting permutation `p = [0, 1, 2]` is correct, but the process of updating `mex` can lead to incorrect values.

- **Correct Implementation:**
  - To correctly implement the MEX condition, we need to ensure that `mex` always reflects the smallest unused value.
  - A better approach would be to use a separate list to track the used values and find the MEX dynamically.

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical flaw in how `mex` is updated, which can lead to incorrect permutations. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**
