Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `t - 1`, `mex` is `n`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except for `p[i]` which is `mex - a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Here, `i` is `t - 1`, and `mex` is `n`. The value of `p[i]` is set to `n - a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
