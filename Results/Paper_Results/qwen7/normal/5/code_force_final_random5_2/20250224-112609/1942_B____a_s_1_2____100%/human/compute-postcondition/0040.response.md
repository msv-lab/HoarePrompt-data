Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - The loop variable `i` is initially set to `1`.
   - The loop runs in reverse order from `n-1` to `0`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments:**
   - The loop condition checks if `i` is within the range `n-1` to `-1` (inclusive).
   - Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to start from `n-1` and decrement until it reaches `0`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - `i` should start at `n-1` and decrement by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` remains as an input integer, but it must be valid for the loop to execute.

4. **State the final modified state:**
   - `i` should be `n-1` initially.
   - `n` must be a valid integer for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be a valid integer**
