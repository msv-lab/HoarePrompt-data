Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [-1] * n
    mex = n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        p[i] = mex - a[i]
        mex = min(mex, p[i])
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `0`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`.

After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `0` because the loop starts from `n-1` and decrements by `1` until it reaches `0`. At this point, the loop condition `i >= 0` will no longer be satisfied, and the loop terminates. The variable `mex` will be updated to be the minimum of itself and `p[0]` on the last iteration, and `p[0]` will be `mex - a[0]`. All other variables' states remain as they were initially or as updated during the loop, with no further changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` must be equal to `n`, `i` is `t - n`, `n` is the same, `mex` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and all elements in the list `p`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`, `a` remains unchanged, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` will be equal to `n`, `i` will be `-1` (since `i` starts from `t-1` and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches `-1`), `mex` will hold the minimum value among all elements in the list `p`, and `p` will be updated such that each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `0`; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex` and all elements in the list `p` after all iterations of the loop; `p` is updated such that each element `p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have reached `0` (since the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to `0`). The variable `mex` will hold the minimum value between its initial value and all the values of `p[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. Each element in the list `p` will be updated to be `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
