Output State: **`j` is 31; `c` is an integer where the bit at position 31 is 0 or `suf[31][1]` is 0; `pre[31][0]` is 0; `pre[31][1]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 31, the value of `suf[31][1]` is decremented by 1. Since `suf[31][1]` was initially 1, after the decrement, it becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
