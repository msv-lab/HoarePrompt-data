Output State: **`i` is 1; `pre[i][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value at `pre[i][0]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1, `pre[1][0]` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `pre[1][0]` is not specified, we assume it was 0 before this operation. After the operation, `pre[1][0]` becomes 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
