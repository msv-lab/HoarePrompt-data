Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 29, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[29]`, `j` is 32, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31: if the bit at position `j` in `cur` (which is `prefix[29]`) is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is the count of occurrences where `prefix[29] >> j & 1` was true; if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is the count of occurrences where `prefix[29] >> j & 1` was false.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if cur >> j & 1:
        suf[j][1] += 1
    else:
        suf[j][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cur` is an integer, `j` is an integer. If the j-th bit (from the right) of `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cur` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `suf` is a list where each element is a tuple `[int, int]`. If the `j`th tuple's second element in `suf` is increased by 1, otherwise, the second element of the `j`th tuple in `suf` remains as `int + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cur` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, and `suf` is a list where each element is a tuple `[int, int]`. If the bit at position `j` of `cur` is 1, then each tuple's second element in `suf` is increased by 1. Otherwise, each tuple in `suf` has its first element increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
