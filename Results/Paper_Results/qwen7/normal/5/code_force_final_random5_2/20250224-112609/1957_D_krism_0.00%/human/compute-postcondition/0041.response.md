Output State: **`i` is 31, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 2, `suf[2][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1, where `j` is 2. Initially, `suf[2][0]` had an unspecified value, but after executing the code, it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
