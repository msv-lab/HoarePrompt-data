Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is 31; `y` is `arr[0]`; `k` is 5**

Explanation: The code calculates the bit length of `y` (which is `arr[0]`) and subtracts 1 from it. Since `y` is `arr[0]`, and assuming `arr[0]` is a non-zero integer (as bit_length for zero is undefined), the bit length of `arr[0]` is 5 (considering `arr[0]` is 16, which is `2^4`). Subtracting 1 from 5 gives us 4. However, since the exact value of `arr[0]` is not specified, we keep it as `y` is `arr[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` is 5.
