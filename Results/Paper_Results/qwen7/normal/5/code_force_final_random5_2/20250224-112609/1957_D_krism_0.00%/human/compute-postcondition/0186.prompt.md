Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is 32, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` reflect the count of 0s and 1s up to that bit position, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` reflect the count of 0s and 1s from that bit position to the end of the integer `c`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, `y` is equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is increased by `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if c >> j & 1:
        pre[j][1] += 1
        suf[j][1] -= 1
    else:
        pre[j][0] += 1
        suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `c` is an integer, `j` is an integer. If `c >> j & 1` is true, then `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `c` is an integer, `j` is an integer + 1 (or 0 if `j` was 31), `pre` is the same array, and `suf` is the same array. If the result of `c >> j & 1` is true, then `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the first element of the `j`-th subarray in `pre` is increased by 1, and the first element of the `j`-th subarray in `suf` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `c` is an integer, `j` is an integer + 1 (or 0 if `j` was 30), `pre` is the same array. If `c >> j & 1` is true, then `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1. If `c >> j & 1` is false, then `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
