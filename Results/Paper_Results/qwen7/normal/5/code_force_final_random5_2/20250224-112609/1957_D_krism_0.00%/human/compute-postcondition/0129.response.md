Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 31, `y` is `arr[2]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `ans` + `pre[5][0] * suf[5][0] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 32**

Explanation: The code `y = arr[i - 1]` updates the value of `y` to be the element at index `i - 1` in the array `arr`. Given that `i` is 3, `y` becomes `arr[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
