Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 31, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `ans` + `pre[5][0] * suf[5][0] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`**.

Explanation: The code `c = prefix[i]` assigns the value of `prefix[i]` to the variable `c`. Given that `i` was initially 1, `c` is now set to `prefix[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
