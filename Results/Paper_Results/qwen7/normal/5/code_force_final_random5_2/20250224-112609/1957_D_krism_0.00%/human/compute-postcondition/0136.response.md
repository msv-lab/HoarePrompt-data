Output State: **`j` is 31; `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The initial state is that `j` is 31 and `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1. The code snippet decrements `suf[j][1]` by 1. Since `j` remains unchanged, its value is still 31. The value of `suf[j][1]` is updated by decrementing it by 1.
