Output State: **`i` is 30, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `j` is 0, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where `suf[0][1]` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the second element of the first row of the `suf` matrix by 1. Initially, `suf[0][1]` was incremented by 1, so now it is incremented by 1 again, making its value 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
