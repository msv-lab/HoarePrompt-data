Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 31, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `ans` + `pre[5][0] * suf[5][0] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1 for j=5.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1 for `j=5`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
