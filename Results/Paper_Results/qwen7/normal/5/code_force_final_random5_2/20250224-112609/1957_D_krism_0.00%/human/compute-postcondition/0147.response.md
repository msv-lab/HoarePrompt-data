Output State: **`j` is 31; `c` is an integer where the bit at position 31 is 0 or `suf[31][1]` is `suf[31][1] - 1`, `pre[31][0]` is 1, and `suf[31][0]` is 0 if the bit is 0.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 31, the value of `suf[31][0]` changes from -1 (if the bit at position 31 is 0) to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
