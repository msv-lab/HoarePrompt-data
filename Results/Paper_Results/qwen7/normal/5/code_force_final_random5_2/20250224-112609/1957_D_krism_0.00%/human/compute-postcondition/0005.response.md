Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing `[0, v ^ 0]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `arr` must have at least one element, `v` is the first element of `arr`**.

Explanation: The code appends the bitwise XOR of the first element of `arr` (`v`) and the last element of `prefix` (which is `0`) to the `prefix` list. Since the last element of `prefix` is `0`, the new element appended is `v ^ 0`, which simplifies to `v`. Therefore, `prefix` now contains `[0, v]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `v` remain unchanged.
