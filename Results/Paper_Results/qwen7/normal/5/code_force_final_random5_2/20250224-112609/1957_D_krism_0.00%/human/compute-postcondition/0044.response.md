Output State: `i` is 31, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 31, `suf` is a list of lists where each sublist has two elements. For every index `j` from 0 to 31, if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is 32 (since it increments by 1 for each iteration where the bit is 1), otherwise `suf[j][0]` is 32 (since it increments by 1 for each iteration where the bit is 0).

This means that after the loop completes all 32 iterations, the variable `j` will be 31 (the last value it can take in the range `range(32)`). The list `suf` will have 32 sublists, where each sublist will contain either 32 or 0 depending on whether the corresponding bit in `cur` was 1 or 0 throughout the loop's iterations.
