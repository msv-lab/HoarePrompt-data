Output State: **max_val which is the largest value of y such that 1 < y < x and x % y == 0 and 2 * y >= x, or max_val remains 1 if no such y exists.**

This means the program returns the value of `max_val`, which is defined as the largest integer `y` that satisfies the conditions \(1 < y < x\), \(x \% y == 0\), and \(2 * y \geq x\). If no such `y` exists, `max_val` remains 1.
