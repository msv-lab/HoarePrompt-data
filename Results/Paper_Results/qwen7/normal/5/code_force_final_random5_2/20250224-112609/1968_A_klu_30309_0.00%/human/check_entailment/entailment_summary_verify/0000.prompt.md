You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        y = func_1(x)
        print(y)

def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:
                return y
            max_val = y
    return max_val



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer \( x \) where \( 2 \leq x \leq 1000 \). It searches for the largest integer \( y \) such that \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) and \( 2y \geq x \). If no such \( y \) exists, it returns \( x - 2 \) or \( x - 3 \) depending on the values found during the search. If no valid \( y \) is found through these checks, it returns the largest \( y \) satisfying the conditions or 1 if no such \( y \) exists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly maximize the value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for all potential cases. Specifically, consider the input \(x = 10\). According to the problem description, we need to find \(y\) such that \(\gcd(10, y) + y\) is maximized. 

- For \(y = 5\), \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\).
- For \(y = 9\), \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).

The program returns \(y = 5\) because it checks from \(x-1\) down to 2 and finds the first \(y\) that divides \(x\). However, \(y = 9\) gives a higher value of \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 10\), which is the maximum possible value for this case.

Thus, the program does not always find the optimal \(y\) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
