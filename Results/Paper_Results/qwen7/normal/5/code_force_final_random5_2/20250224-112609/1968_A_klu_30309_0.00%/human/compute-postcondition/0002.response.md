Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `y` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `x - 1` down to `1` with a step of `-1`. This means `x` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute because if `x` were `1` or less, the range would not include any values.

3. **Determine the initial value of `y`**: The loop starts with `y` being `x - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `x` is greater than `1` so that the loop can start, and `y` should be initialized to `x - 1`.

Given the state before the loop starts: `max_val` is 1, we need to adjust the states of `x` and `y`.

State: **`max_val` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is `x - 1`**
