Output State: **`s` is 0, `num` is the previous value of `num` incremented by 1, `list2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code creates an empty list named `list2`. The values of `s` and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `s` is still 0, `num` is the previous value of `num` incremented by 1, and `list2` is an empty list.
