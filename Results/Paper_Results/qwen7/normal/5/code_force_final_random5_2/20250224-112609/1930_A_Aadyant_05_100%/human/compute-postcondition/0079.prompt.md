Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for num in range(int(n)):
    s = 0
    list2 = []
    a = input()
    list1 = []
    b = input()
    list1 = b.split()
    for str in list1:
        list2.append(int(str))
    list2.sort()
    for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
        s = s + int(list2[i])
    final.append(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is the sum of every second element in `list2` from index 0 to the last index (inclusive if the length is odd, exclusive otherwise), `i` is `2 * len(list2)`, `total` is `s`, `final` is a list containing `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a non-empty string, `list2` is a sorted list, `s` is the original value of `s` plus the sum of the integer values of all elements in `list2` at even indices, `final` is a list containing one element which is `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is equal to `2 * (len(list2) - 1)`, `s` is the original value of `s` plus the sum of every second element in `list2` starting from the first element, and `final` contains the sum of every second element in `list2` starting from the first element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
