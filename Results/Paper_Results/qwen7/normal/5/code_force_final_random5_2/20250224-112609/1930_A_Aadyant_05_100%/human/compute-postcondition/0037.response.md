Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `str` and `list1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `list1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is a non-empty string.
   - `list1` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `b`.
   - `list2` is a list with one element which is the integer representation of the first string in `list1`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `list1`, at the end of each iteration, `str` will be set to the next string in `list1`.
   - After the first iteration, `list1` will have one less element because the first element (which was assigned to `str`) is now processed.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `b` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `list1` will have one less element since the first element is now processed.
   - `list2` remains unchanged as it does not change within the loop body based on the given information.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `list1` has one less element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`b` is a non-empty string, list1 is a list of strings with one less element than before, list2 is a list with one element which is the integer representation of the first string in the updated list1**.
