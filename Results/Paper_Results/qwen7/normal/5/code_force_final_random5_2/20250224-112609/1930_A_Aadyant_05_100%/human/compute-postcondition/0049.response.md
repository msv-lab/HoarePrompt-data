Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `b` is a non-empty string.
   - `list2` is a sorted list.
   - `s` is the original value of `s` plus the integer value of the element at index `i + 1` in `list2`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over indices of `list2` starting from 0 and incrementing by 2 each time.
   - This means that `i` takes on even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - We need to determine the new state of the variables at the start of the next iteration.
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `list2`.

5. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been an even number (e.g., if it was 0 before, now it could be 2).
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2, the next value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 2.

6. **New State:**
   - `b` remains a non-empty string.
   - `list2` remains a sorted list.
   - `s` will be updated based on the next element in the list, which is at index `i + 1` (which is now `i + 3`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 2 from its previous value.
- `s` is updated to include the integer value of the element at index `i + 3` in `list2`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `list2` is a sorted list, `s` is the original value of `s` plus the integer value of the element at index `i + 3` in `list2`**
