Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is an input string, `list1` is an empty list**.

The code initializes `list1` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated information about `list1`.
