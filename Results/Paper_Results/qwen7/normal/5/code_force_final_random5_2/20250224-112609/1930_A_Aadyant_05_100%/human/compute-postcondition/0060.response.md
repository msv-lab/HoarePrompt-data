Output State: **`b` is an input string, `list2` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `final` is a list containing one element which is `s`, `num` is incremented by 1, `a` is an input string, `list1` is a list of words from the string `b`.**

Explanation: The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of words based on spaces (default delimiter). The values of `b`, `list2`, `s`, `final`, `num`, `a`, and `list1` are updated accordingly. `list2` remains an empty list, `s` remains 0, `final` remains a list containing the initial value of `s` (which is 0), `num` is incremented by 1, and `list1` is now a list of words from the string `b`.
