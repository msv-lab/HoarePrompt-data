Output State: **`i` is 3; `s` is the original value of `s` plus the integer value of the fourth element of `list2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding the integer value of the element at index `i` (which is 3) in `list2`. Since `len(list2)` must be greater than 3, the element at index 3 exists and its value is converted to an integer before being added to `s`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
