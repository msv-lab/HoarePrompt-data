Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `num` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `num` is initialized to the value of `0` when the loop starts (since `range(int(n))` generates values from `0` to `int(n) - 1`).

Given the constraints:
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0, the loop won't run at all).

Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) (this variable is not directly relevant to the loop execution and doesn't need adjustment).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `num` is initialized to 0.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0**
