Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `num` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `num < int(n)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is a non-empty string.
   - `list2` is a sorted list.
   - `s` is the original value of `s` plus the sum of the integer values of all elements in `list2` at even indices.
   - `final` is a list containing one element which is `s`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `num` and `int(n)`, we need to update `num` and ensure `int(n)` remains unchanged.
   - `num` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, so it is now `num + 1`.
   - `int(n)` remains the same as it was before the loop started or was not updated inside the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `b` remains a non-empty string.
   - `list2` remains a sorted list.
   - `s` remains the original value of `s` plus the sum of the integer values of all elements in `list2` at even indices (since no changes were made to `s` inside the loop).
   - `final` remains a list containing one element which is `s`.

6. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `num` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `int(n)` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `list2` is a sorted list, `s` is the original value of `s` plus the sum of the integer values of all elements in `list2` at even indices, `final` is a list containing one element which is `s`, `num` is incremented by 1, `int(n)` remains the same**.
