Output State: **`i` is 'B', `hmp` is {'A': 'B', 'B': 'C', 'C': 'D', 'D': 'E', 'E': 'F', 'F': 'G'}, `ans` is `m - 'C'`**.

Explanation: The dictionary `hmp` maps each key to its corresponding value. For `i = 'B'`, `hmp[i]` is `'C'`. The code updates `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]`, which translates to `ans += m - 'C'`. Since `m` is not defined in the initial state, we keep it as `m` in the output state. The other variables remain unchanged.
