Output State: **`hmp` has been iterated over, `ans` is equal to the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs from the user, splits them by space, and converts them into integers. It assigns the first input to `n` and the second input to `m`. The variables `hmp`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `m`, along with the unchanged values of `hmp`, `ans`, and `t`.
