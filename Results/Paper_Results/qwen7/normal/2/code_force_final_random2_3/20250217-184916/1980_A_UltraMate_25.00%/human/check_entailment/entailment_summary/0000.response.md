Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure there are at least \( m \) problems of each difficulty level 'A' to 'F' across all test cases. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Data Processing**: For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \), and the string \( s \) which represents the existing problems and their difficulties.
3. **Count Calculation**: It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level 'A' to 'F' in the string \( s \).
4. **Requirement Check**: It checks if each required difficulty level ('A' to 'F') is present in the counter. If not, it adds \( m \) to the answer, indicating that all \( m \) problems of that difficulty level need to be newly created.
5. **Additional Problems Calculation**: For each difficulty level that is present but insufficient, it calculates the difference between \( m \) and the current count, adding this difference to the total number of problems that need to be created.
6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

Given the logical steps and the implementation details, the program accurately computes the required output as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
