Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 'B'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEF'
   - `ans` is equal to `m` plus the previous value of `ans`

3. **Determine the effect of the loop on these variables**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `p`.
   - In the previous iteration, `i` was 'B'.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is iterating through `p`, and it was 'B' in the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be the next character in `p` after 'B'.
   - The next character in 'ABCDEF' after 'B' is 'C'.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 'C' in the next iteration.

5. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `p`.
   - Since `p` is 'ABCDEF' and `i` was 'B' in the previous iteration, there are still characters left in `p` ('C', 'D', 'E', 'F').

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 'C'.
   - `p` remains 'ABCDEF' (no change since the loop head does not modify `p`).
   - `ans` remains equal to `m` plus the previous value of `ans` (no change since the loop body is omitted).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEF', and `ans` is equal to `m` plus the previous value of `ans`**.
