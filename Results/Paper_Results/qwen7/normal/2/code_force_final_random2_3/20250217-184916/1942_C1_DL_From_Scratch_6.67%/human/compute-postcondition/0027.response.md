Postcondition: **`list0` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `count` is equal to the number of times `num` equals 1 for consecutive elements in `list0` plus 1, `i` is `x-2`, `num` is 1, `n` is `list0[-1] + 1`**.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, the list `list0` remains sorted in ascending order. The variable `count` is incremented by 1 if `num` equals 1 for consecutive elements in `list0`. The variable `i` remains `x-2`, `num` is set to 1, and `n` is set to `list0[-1] + 1`.
