Output State: **`i` is `x - 2`; `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is initially set to `x - 2`. The code snippet assigns the value of `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` to the variable `num`. Therefore, `num` is now calculated based on the values of `i` and the list `list0`. The initial state of `i` remains unchanged as `x - 2`, and `num` is updated according to the given formula.
