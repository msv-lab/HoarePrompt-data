Output State: **`i` is `x`, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`**

Explanation: The code does not change the values of the variables `i` and `num`. It simply reassigns the value of `num` to the same expression `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`, which was already the value of `num` before the line of code was executed. Therefore, the values of `i` and `num` remain unchanged.
