Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `x - 1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < x - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `x - 1`
   - `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `x - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be `x`.
   - The value of `num` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop itself but rather by the values in `list0`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be `x`.
   - `num` remains the same, which is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `x`, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`**
