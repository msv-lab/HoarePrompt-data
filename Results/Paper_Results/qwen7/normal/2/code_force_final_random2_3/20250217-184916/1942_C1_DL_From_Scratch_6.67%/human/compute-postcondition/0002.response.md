Output State: **`T` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input split.**

The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The precondition that `T` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) remains unchanged, while `n`, `x`, and `y` are now assigned the values obtained from the input.
