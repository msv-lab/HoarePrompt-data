Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of input strings sorted in ascending order except for the first element, `suma` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the `numbers` list.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `a`. The precondition that `numbers` is a non-empty list of input strings sorted in ascending order remains valid, except now the first element has been removed. All other variables remain unchanged.
