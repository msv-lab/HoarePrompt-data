Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` has at least one element less than before, `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping, `suma` is `suma + min(a, b)` where `a` is the first element of `numbers` after popping, and `suma` is updated by adding the minimum of `a` and `b` to its current value.**

This means that `suma` has been updated to include the minimum value between `a` (the first element of `numbers` after popping) and `b` (the second element of `numbers` after popping). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously described states.
