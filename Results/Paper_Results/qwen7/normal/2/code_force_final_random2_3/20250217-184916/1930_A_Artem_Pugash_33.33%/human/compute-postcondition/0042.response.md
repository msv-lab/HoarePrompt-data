Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers popped from the `numbers` list until it became empty, `numInteger` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `numInteger = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `numInteger`. The other variables (`numCases`, `i`, `numbers`, and `suma`) remain unchanged.
