The loop condition is `numbers != []`, which means the loop continues as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must still be non-empty at the start of the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- `numCases` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `numInteger` is an input integer
- `numbers` has at least one less element
- `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping
- `suma` is `suma + min(a, b)`

To ensure `numbers` is not empty for the next iteration, we need to ensure that there is at least one element left in `numbers` before the loop starts. Since `numbers` has at least one less element at the end of the previous iteration, it means that `numbers` had at least two elements initially (one of which was popped).

Therefore, for the loop to continue, `numbers` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` must have at least one element, `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping, `suma` is `suma + min(a, b)`**
