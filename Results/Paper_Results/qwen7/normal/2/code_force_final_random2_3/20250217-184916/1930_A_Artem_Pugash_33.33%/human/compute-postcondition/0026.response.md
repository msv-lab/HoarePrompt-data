Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `numbers != []`, which means the loop will execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty.

2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `numbers`.

3. **Determine the current state of `numbers`**: The state right before the loop is given as `numbers` is a list of input strings sorted in ascending order.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: For the loop to execute the first time, `numbers` must not be an empty list. Since the problem states that `numbers` is a list of input strings sorted in ascending order, it implies that `numbers` is not empty at the start. However, to explicitly ensure the loop can proceed, we need to confirm that `numbers` is not empty.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `numbers` is not an empty list. Given the current state, we can directly state that `numbers` should not be an empty list.

Therefore, the state right before the loop needs to be adjusted to ensure that `numbers` is not an empty list.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of input strings sorted in ascending order, `suma` is 0**
