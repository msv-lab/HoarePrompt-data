Output State: `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers taken from the original list until no more pairs could be formed.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `numbers` will be an empty list because the loop continues to pop elements from the list until it is empty. For each iteration, the loop pops two elements from the beginning of the list, calculates the minimum of these two elements, and adds this minimum to `suma`. This process repeats until there are not enough elements left in `numbers` to form another pair. Therefore, `suma` will contain the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs of integers from the original list.
