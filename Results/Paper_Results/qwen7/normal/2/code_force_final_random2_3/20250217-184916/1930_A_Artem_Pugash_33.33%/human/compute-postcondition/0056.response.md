Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of input strings sorted in ascending order, `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list before it was removed, `b` is the integer value of the first element of the list after it was removed and the first element was an integer, `suma` is `b` - 1, the first element of `numbers` is popped and converted to an integer and assigned to `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `numbers` was sorted in ascending order and the first element was an integer, `b` now holds the integer value of that element. The precondition that `numbers` is a non-empty list remains true, and the first element is no longer part of the list.
