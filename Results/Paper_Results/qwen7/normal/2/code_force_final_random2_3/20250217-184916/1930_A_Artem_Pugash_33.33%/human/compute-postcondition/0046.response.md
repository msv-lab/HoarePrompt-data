Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `numbers != []`, which means the loop will execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `numCases` must be greater than 3
   - `i` is 3
   - `numInteger` is an input integer
   - `numbers` is a list of input strings sorted in ascending order
   - `suma` is 0

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `numbers`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `numbers` must not be an empty list.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `numbers` is a list of input strings sorted in ascending order, it must contain at least one element for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `numbers` is not an empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`numCases` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of input strings sorted in ascending order, `suma` is 0**
