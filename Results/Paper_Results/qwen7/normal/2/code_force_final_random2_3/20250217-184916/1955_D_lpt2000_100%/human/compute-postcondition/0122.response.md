Output State: **`E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `D[out_aa]`, `pairs_in_D`, and `C[out_aa]` remain unchanged, `in_aa` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code snippet `E[in_aa] += 1` increments the value of `E[in_aa]` by 1. No other changes are made to the variables `D[out_aa]`, `pairs_in_D`, `C[out_aa]`, `in_aa`, or `out_aa`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values from the initial state.
