Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `fnd` is 0, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is an empty list, `C` is an empty list, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `in_aa` is undefined, `out_aa` is undefined, `bb` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `aa` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting the elements of `bb`.**

Explanation: The line `pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())` calculates the sum of the values in the Counter object `D` and assigns it to the variable `pairs_in_D`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
