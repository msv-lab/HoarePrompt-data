Output State: **`m` is less than `n` and `n - m` is greater than 0, and the value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and the current value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `E[out_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of `E[out_aa]` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
