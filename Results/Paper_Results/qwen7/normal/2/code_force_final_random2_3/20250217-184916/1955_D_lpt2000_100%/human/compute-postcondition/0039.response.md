Output State: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `in_aa` and `out_aa` are the next pair of elements from the slices `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`; `m` and `n` remain the same; the expected value of `out_aa` is reduced by 1.**

This means that the value of `fnd` remains unchanged or is increased by 1 based on the condition `pairs_in_D >= k`. The variables `in_aa` and `out_aa` are still the next pair of elements from the specified slices of `aa`, and `m` and `n` remain the same. Additionally, the expected value of `out_aa` has been decreased by 1.
