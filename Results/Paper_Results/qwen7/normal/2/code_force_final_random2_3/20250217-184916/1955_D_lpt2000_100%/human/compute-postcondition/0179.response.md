Output State: **`D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `m` is less than `n` and `n - m` is greater than 0, `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and either `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 or `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `D[in_aa] += 1` increases the value of `D[in_aa]` by 1. The conditions involving `m`, `n`, `D[out_aa]`, `E[out_aa]`, and `C[out_aa]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
