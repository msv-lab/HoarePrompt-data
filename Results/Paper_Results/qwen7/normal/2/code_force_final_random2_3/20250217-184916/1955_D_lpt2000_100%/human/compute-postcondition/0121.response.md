Output State: **`D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged if `D[out_aa] > 0` and `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

This means that `C[in_aa]` has been decreased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states as described.
