Output State: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 (if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, it is further decreased by 1); `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 (if `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0); `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1 (if `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0) or decreased by 1 (otherwise); `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged; `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

This output state reflects the changes in the variables based on the condition evaluated in the given code snippet.
