Output State: **`D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `m` is less than `n` and `n - m` is greater than 0, `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `pairs_in_D` is 1, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `pairs_in_D += 1` increments the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. Since no other variables are directly affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `m` is less than `n` and `n - m` is greater than 0, `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, and `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0. Additionally, `pairs_in_D` is now 1.
