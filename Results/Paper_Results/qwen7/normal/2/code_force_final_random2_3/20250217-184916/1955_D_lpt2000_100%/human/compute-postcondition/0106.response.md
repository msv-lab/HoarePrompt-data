Output State: **`C` is a Counter object representing `cnt_bb` minus `D`, `n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `fnd` is 0, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing `cnt_aa` minus `D`, `in_aa` is undefined, `out_aa` is undefined, `bb` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `aa` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting the elements of `bb`, `aa` must have at least `n` elements, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the variable `E[in_aa]` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
