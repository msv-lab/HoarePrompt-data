Postcondition: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. In both cases, `in_aa` and `out_aa` are the next pair of elements from the slices `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`, respectively, and `m` and `n` remain the same. If the condition `D[out_aa] > 0` is true, then `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is increased by 1, and the expected value of `out_aa` is reduced by 1. If the condition `D[out_aa] > 0` is false, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.
