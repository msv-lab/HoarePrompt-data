Output State: **`m` is less than `n` and `n - m` is greater than 0, and `D[out_aa]` is equal to -1**

Explanation: The code `E[out_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of `E[out_aa]` by 1. Given the initial state where `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, after subtracting 1, `D[out_aa]` becomes -1. The conditions involving `m`, `n`, and their difference remain unchanged.
