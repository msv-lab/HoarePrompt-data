Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string from the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new string `s`, `b` is a string which is the sorted version of the input string `s`, `c` is a string which is the sorted version of the input string `s` but in descending order, `s` is now the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes a new string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their previous states.
