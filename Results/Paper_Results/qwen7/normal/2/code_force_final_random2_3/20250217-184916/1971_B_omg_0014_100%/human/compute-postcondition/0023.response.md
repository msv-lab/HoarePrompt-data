Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string from the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new string `s`, `b` is a string which is the sorted version of the input string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` sorts the characters in the string `s` and joins them back into a single string. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new variable `b` is created and assigned the value of the sorted string `s`.
