Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `s` is a string input from the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the string `s`. If the size of the set `a` is 1, then the postcondition remains as the precondition. Otherwise, `b` is a string which is the sorted version of `s`, and `c` is a string which is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order. If `b` equals `s`, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is the sorted version of `s` but not equal to `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string from the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new string `s`, `b` is a string which is the sorted version of the input string `s`, and `c` is a string which is the sorted version of the input string `s` but in descending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string from the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new string `s`, `b` is the sorted version of the input string `s`, `c` is the sorted version of the input string `s` but in descending order, `s` is now the string input by the user, `a` is a set of unique characters from `s`. If the set `a` contains exactly one unique character, `c` remains unchanged as the sorted version of the input string `s` in descending order. Otherwise, `c` becomes the sorted version of the input string `s` in descending order.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
