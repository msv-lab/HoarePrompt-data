Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins.
2. The provided solution reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
3. The solution correctly counts the number of 'U' (up-facing) coins in each test case.
4. The logic for determining the winner is based on whether the number of up-facing coins is odd or even:
   - If the number of up-facing coins is odd, Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a losing position.
   - If the number of up-facing coins is even, Bob wins because he can always respond to Alice's moves in such a way that Alice ends up in a losing position.
5. The solution iterates through each test case, counts the up-facing coins, and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list accordingly.
6. Finally, the solution prints the results for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner based on the number of up-facing coins.

Correctness: **True**
