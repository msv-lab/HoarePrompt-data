Output State: **`index` is 8, `t` is 0, `n` is data[8], `s` is a string of length data[8] containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list with either 'YES' or 'NO' appended, `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s`, `n` is an integer value from data[8]**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` takes the value at index 8 from the `data` list and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
