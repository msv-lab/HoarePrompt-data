#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, so `index` is 12, `t` is 0, `n` is `data[11]`, `s` is a string of length `data[11]` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list with either 'YES' or 'NO' appended for each iteration, and `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, 'YES' is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended to `results`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes, `index` will be 12 (since it increments by 2 for each iteration and there were 6 iterations), `t` will be 0 (as it starts at a positive value and is not modified within the loop), `n` will be the value at `data[11]`, `s` will be a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", and `results` will contain 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition that the count of 'U' in `s` is odd or even, respectively, for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list contains 6 elements, all of which are either 'YES' or 'NO'. The `result` variable refers to the 6th element of the `results` list. The `index` variable is 12, `t` remains 0, `n` is the value at `data[11]`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", and `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, the 6th element in `results` is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`. If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, one per line.
