Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer from the data list at index 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".**

The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 1, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
