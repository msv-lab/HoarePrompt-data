Based on the initial state provided:

- The `results` list still contains 6 elements.
- For the next iteration, the loop will use the 5th element of the `results` list.

We know that the `result` variable will now refer to the 5th element of the `results` list. Since the exact values of the elements in the `results` list are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`.

However, we can describe the value of `result` as the 5th element of the `results` list.

Output: **the 5th element of the `results` list**
