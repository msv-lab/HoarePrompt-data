Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`. If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, one per line.**
