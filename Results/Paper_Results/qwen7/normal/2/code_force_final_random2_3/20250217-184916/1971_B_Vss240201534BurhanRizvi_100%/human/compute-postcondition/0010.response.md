Output State: **`s2` is a string obtained by shifting all characters of `s` one position to the left, wrapping around the first character to the end of the string.**

Explanation: The code `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` takes the string `s`, removes its first character (using `s[1:]`), and then appends the first character of `s` to the end (`+ s[0]`). This effectively rotates the string `s` one position to the left, making the first character move to the last position. The initial condition that `s2` is a random permutation of `s` no longer holds since the string is now systematically rotated. The lengths and character sets of `s` and `s2` remain the same, but their order changes according to the described operation.
