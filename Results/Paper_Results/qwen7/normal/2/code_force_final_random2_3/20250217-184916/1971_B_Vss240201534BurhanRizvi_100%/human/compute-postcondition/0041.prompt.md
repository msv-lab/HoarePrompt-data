Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    if len(s) == 1:
        print('No')
    elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
        print('No')
    else:
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s == s2:
            s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
        print('Yes')
        print(s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string. If the length of `s` is 1, the function does nothing. If the length of `s` is greater than 1 and all characters in `s` are the same, then the function does nothing. Otherwise, `s` is transformed into a string where all characters are shifted one position to the left, with the first character moving to the end of the string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is the string input by the user. If the length of `s` is 1, the function does nothing. Otherwise, if the string `s` has all unique characters and its length is greater than 1, the function also does nothing. If the string `s` does not have all unique characters or its length is not greater than 1, the function creates a new string `s2` where the first character of `s` is moved to the end of `s2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The input value is decremented by 1, and `s` is the decremented input value as a string. If the length of `s` is 1, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `s` becomes a string obtained by taking all characters of `s` except the first one and appending the first character of `s` to the end.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
