Reasoning:

1. The function correctly handles the case where the string `s` consists of a single character, printing "No" as required.
2. For strings with more than one character, the function uses `random.sample` to generate a new string `s2` by shuffling the characters of `s`.
3. If the shuffled string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, the function attempts to create a different string by shifting the first character to the end (`s[1:] + s[0]`).
4. The function prints "Yes" followed by the new string `s2` if `s2` is different from `s`, or "No" if it remains the same.
5. Given the constraints (strings of length at most 10), the function should work correctly for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Based on the above reasoning, the function appears to handle all edge cases and follows the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
