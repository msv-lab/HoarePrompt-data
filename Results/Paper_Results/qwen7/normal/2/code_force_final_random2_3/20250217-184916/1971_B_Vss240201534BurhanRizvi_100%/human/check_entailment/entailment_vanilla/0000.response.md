Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the string `s` for each test case.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the length of `s` is 1, the program prints 'No', which is correct because there are no other characters to rearrange.
   - If all characters in `s` are the same (e.g., 'aaaaa'), the program also prints 'No' because no rearrangement can produce a different string.

3. **General Case:**
   - For strings with more than one unique character, the program uses `random.sample` to generate a random permutation of the string `s`.
   - If the generated permutation `s2` is the same as `s`, it tries to create a different permutation by rotating the string (i.e., moving the first character to the end).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' followed by the generated permutation `s2`.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Edge Cases:**
  - Single-character strings are handled correctly.
  - Strings with all identical characters are handled correctly.

- **General Case:**
  - The use of `random.sample` ensures that the generated permutation is different from the original string `s` with high probability.
  - The rotation method (`s[1:] + s[0]`) is a simple way to ensure a different string when `s2` is the same as `s`.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program processes each test case independently, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all edge cases and general cases as per the problem description. It ensures that if a different string can be formed, it does so; otherwise, it reports that it's impossible.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
