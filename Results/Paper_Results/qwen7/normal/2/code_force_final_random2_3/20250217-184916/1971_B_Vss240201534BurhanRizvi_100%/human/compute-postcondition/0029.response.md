Postcondition: `s` is the string input by the user. If the length of `s` is 1, the function does nothing. Otherwise, if the string `s` has all unique characters and its length is greater than 1, the function also does nothing. If the string `s` does not have all unique characters or its length is not greater than 1, the function creates a new string `s2` where the first character of `s` is moved to the end of `s2`.
