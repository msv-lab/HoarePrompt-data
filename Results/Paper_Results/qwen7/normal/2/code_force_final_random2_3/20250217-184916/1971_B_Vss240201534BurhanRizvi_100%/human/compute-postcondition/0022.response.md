Output State: **`s2` is a string where the first character of `s` is moved to the end of `s2`.**

Explanation: The code `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` takes the string `s` and creates a new string `s2` by taking all characters from the second character to the end (`s[1:]`) and appending the first character of `s` (`s[0]`) to the end of this substring. This effectively rotates the string `s` by one position to the left, making the first character of `s` the last character of `s2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
