Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `empty` is True, `t` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains 1 integer such that 1 ≤ `u_1` ≤ `n`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `tree` is an empty deque.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    if empty:
        tree.append(u)
        tree.append(v)
        empty = False
    elif v == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(u)
    elif v == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(u)
    elif u == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(v)
    elif u == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. After executing the if-else block, `tree` will either contain the integers `[u, v]` with `empty` set to False, or it will have `v` as its new first element if `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, or `u` as its new last element if `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`. If neither of these conditions is met, then `u` will equal the last element of `tree`, and `tree` will have one additional element which is `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `i` is 3, and `tree` is a list. If `empty` is False, then `tree` contains `u` and `v`. If `empty` is True, then `v` is added to `tree`. If `v` equals the last element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the end of `tree`. Otherwise, if `v` equals the first element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the left end of `tree`; otherwise, `v` is added to the list `tree`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 4, `u` is an input integer converted to an integer, `v` is an input integer converted to an integer, `tree` is a list. If `empty` is False, `u` and `v` are appended to the `tree`. If `empty` is True, `u` is appended to the left end of `tree` if `v` equals the first element of `tree`, otherwise `u` is appended to the right end of `tree`. If `v` equals the last element of `tree`, `u` is appended to the right end of `tree`. If neither condition is met, `v` is appended to the right end of `tree`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
