Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `tree` now contains the integers `[u, v]`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `tree`. Initially, `tree` contains the integer `u`. After appending `v`, `tree` will contain both `u` and `v` as its elements. The values of `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
