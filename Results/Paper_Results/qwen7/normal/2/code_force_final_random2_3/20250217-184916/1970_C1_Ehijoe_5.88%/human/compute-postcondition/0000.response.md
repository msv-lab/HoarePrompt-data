Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains 1 integer such that 1 ≤ `u_1` ≤ `n`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `n`, `t` are updated to the values entered by the user.**

The code reads two integers from the input, assigning them to `n` and `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is 1 and `u` and `v` are integers within certain bounds, these conditions remain unchanged. The list of starting nodes still contains `t` (which is now known to be 1) integers within the specified range. The values of `n` and `t` are updated to the values provided by the user, but the constraints on their values are preserved.
