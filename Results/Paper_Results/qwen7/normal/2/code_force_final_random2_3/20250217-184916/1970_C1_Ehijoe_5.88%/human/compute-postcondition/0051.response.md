Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 4, `u` is an input integer converted to an integer, `v` is an input integer converted to an integer, `tree` is a list with `u` appended to it.**

The code `tree.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `tree`. Since `u` is an input integer converted to an integer, it is added to the list. The values of `n`, `i`, `v`, and the original list `tree` remain unchanged except for the addition of `u` to `tree`.
