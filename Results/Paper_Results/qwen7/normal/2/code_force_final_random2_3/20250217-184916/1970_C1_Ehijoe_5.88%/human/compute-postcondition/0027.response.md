Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` now has `u` as its new last element. If `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` now has `v` as its new first element. Otherwise, `u` equals the last element of `tree`, and `tree` now contains one additional element which is `v`.**
