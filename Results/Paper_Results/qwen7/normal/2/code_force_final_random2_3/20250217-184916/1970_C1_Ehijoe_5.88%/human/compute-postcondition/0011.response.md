Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `tree` is a deque with the leftmost element as `u`.**

The code `tree.appendleft(u)` appends the value of `u` to the left end of the deque `tree`. Since `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, the if condition did not evaluate to true, and thus the code inside the if block was not executed. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 and `v` is an input integer remains unchanged.
