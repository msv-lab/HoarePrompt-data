Output State: The `tree` deque will contain `n` elements, where `n` is the input integer provided. The `empty` variable will be `False` since the loop has completed all its iterations. The order of elements in `tree` will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each pair `(u, v)`:

- If `v` is the first element of `tree`, `u` is added to the beginning of `tree`.
- If `v` is the last element of `tree`, `u` is added to the end of `tree`.
- Otherwise, `u` is added to the end of `tree` and `v` is added to the end of `tree`.

The `i` variable will be `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n-1` times.
