Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer and the current value of `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`, `v` is an input integer and is not equal to the first element of `tree` and is not equal to the last element of `tree`, `tree` now has `v` as its new first element.**

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(v)` appends the value of `v` to the left end of the list `tree`. Since `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree` and is not equal to the last element of `tree`, appending `v` to the left end of `tree` changes the first element of `tree` to `v`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
