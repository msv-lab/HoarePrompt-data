Postcondition: `tree` deque contains `n` elements, `empty` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing `[min(n, idx), min(n, n - idx - 1)]`. If at least one move in `moves` is odd, the condition remains as is. If all moves in `moves` are even numbers, the condition remains as is.
