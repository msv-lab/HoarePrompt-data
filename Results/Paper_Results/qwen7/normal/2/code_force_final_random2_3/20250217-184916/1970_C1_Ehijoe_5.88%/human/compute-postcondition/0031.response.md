Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `u` is an input integer.
- `v` is an input integer.
- The postcondition of the if-else block is:
  - `tree` will either contain the integers `[u, v]` with `empty` set to False.
  - Or, if `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, `tree` will have `v` as its new first element and `empty` set to False.
  - Or, if `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `tree` will have `u` as its new last element and `empty` set to False.
  - Otherwise, `u` will equal the last element of `tree`, and `tree` will have one additional element which is `v`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
- The loop variable `i` is not directly used in the given if-else block, but the loop itself depends on the value of `n`.

### Adjusting the State
- Since the loop runs `n - 1` times, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `3` (since it was `2` at the end of the previous iteration).
- The value of `n` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

### New State
- `n` must still be greater than 1.
- `u` and `v` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
- The state of `tree` is determined by the if-else block, but since we are only asked to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we do not change `tree`.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `i` is 3**
