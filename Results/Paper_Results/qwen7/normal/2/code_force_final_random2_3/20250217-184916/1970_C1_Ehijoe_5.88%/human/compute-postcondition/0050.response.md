Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 4, `u` is an input integer converted to an integer, `v` is an input integer converted to an integer, `tree` is a list**.

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `u` and `v`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 5 remains unchanged, `i` is still 4, and `tree` is still a list. The values of `u` and `v` are now integers based on the input.
