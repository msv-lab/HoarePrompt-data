Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 4, `u` is an input integer converted to an integer, `v` is an input integer converted to an integer, `tree` is a list with `u` and `v` appended to it.**

The code `tree.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `tree`. Since `u` was already appended to `tree` before, the updated list `tree` now contains both `u` and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
