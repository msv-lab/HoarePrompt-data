Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 4, `u` is an input integer converted to an integer, `v` is an input integer converted to an integer, `tree` is a list with one additional element `u`.**

The code `tree.append(u)` adds the value of `u` to the list `tree`. Since `u` is an input integer converted to an integer, it is added to the existing list `tree`. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 5 and `i` is 4 are still valid.
