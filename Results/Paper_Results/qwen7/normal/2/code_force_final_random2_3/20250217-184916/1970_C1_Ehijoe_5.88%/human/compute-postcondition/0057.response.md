Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 4, `u` is an input integer converted to an integer, `v` is an input integer converted to an integer, `tree` is a list with `v` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `tree`. The values of `n`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 5 is still valid. The list `tree` now contains all its original elements plus the new element `v`.
