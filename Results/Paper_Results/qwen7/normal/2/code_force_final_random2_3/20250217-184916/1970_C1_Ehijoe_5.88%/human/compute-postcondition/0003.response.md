Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - `i` starts from 0 because `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n - 2`.
   - `n` is given as an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be a positive number. This means `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `empty` is True (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `t` is an input integer (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `u` and `v` are integers such that `1 ≤ u, v ≤ n` (this does not directly affect the loop execution but ensures valid indices if needed within the loop).
- The list of integers for the starting node(s) contains 1 integer such that `1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n` (this does not directly affect the loop execution but ensures valid starting nodes if needed within the loop).
- `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5` (we need to ensure this condition is met).
- `tree` is an empty deque (this does not affect the loop execution).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is greater than 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
