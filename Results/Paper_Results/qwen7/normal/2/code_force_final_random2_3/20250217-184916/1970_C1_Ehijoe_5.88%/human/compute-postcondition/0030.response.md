Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. After executing the if-else block, `tree` will either contain the integers `[u, v]` with `empty` set to False, or it will have `v` as its new first element if `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, or `u` as its new last element if `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`. If neither of these conditions is met, then `u` will equal the last element of `tree`, and `tree` will have one additional element which is `v`.
