Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `u` is an input integer.
   - `v` is an input integer.
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `tree` is a list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i` to `n-1`. Since `i` is currently 3, the loop will run as long as `i < n-1`.

4. **Update the state based on the loop condition**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `i`).

5. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - If the loop continues, `i` will become 4.

6. **Determine the new condition for `n`**:
   - Since `i` is now 4, for the loop to continue, `4 < n-1` must hold true.
   - This implies `n > 5`.

7. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 5.

8. **Final state**:
   - `n` must be greater than 5.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `u` remains an input integer.
   - `v` remains an input integer.
   - `tree` remains a list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 4, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `tree` is a list.**
