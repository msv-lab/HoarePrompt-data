Output State: **`tree` deque contains `n` elements, `empty` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**

The code `idx = tree.index(start)` assigns the index of the element `start` in the `tree` deque to the variable `idx`. The values of `tree`, `empty`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
