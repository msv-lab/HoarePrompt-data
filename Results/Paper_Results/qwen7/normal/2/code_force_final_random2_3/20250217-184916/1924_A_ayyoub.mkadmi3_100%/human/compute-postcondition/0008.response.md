Output State: **`s2` is a string containing the first character of `s`, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must not be empty, `i` is the first character of `s`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s2 += i` appends the value of `i` (which is the first character of `s`) to the string `s2`. The initial state of `s` and `i` remains unchanged, and `s2` is initialized to be an empty string before this operation, thus containing only the first character of `s` after this operation.
