Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must not be empty, `i` is the first character of `s`, and `alphabet` remains unchanged. If `i` is in `alphabet`, then `s1` is the first character of `s` and `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s`.
