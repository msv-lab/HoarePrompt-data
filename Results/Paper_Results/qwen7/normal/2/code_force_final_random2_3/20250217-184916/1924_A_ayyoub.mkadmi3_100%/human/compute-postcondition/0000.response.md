Output State: **`s1` is an empty string, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`.**

The code initializes `s1` as an empty string. The values of `s`, `m`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
