Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is an empty string, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`, `s2` is an empty string; `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in alphabet:
        if len(alphabet) != 1:
            alphabet.remove(i)
        else:
            s2 += i
            alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
        s1 += i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must not be empty, `i` is the first character of `s`, and `alphabet` remains unchanged. If `i` is in `alphabet`, then `s1` is the first character of `s` and `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s`. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `m-1` starting with the second character of the original `s`, `i` is the third character of the original `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a+k-1' with `i` removed if `len(alphabet) != 1`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, then `s` is concatenated with `i`; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a string of length `m-2` starting with the third character of the original `s`, `i` is the fourth character of the original `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a+k-1' with `i` removed if `len(alphabet) != 1'. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is the character `i`. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
