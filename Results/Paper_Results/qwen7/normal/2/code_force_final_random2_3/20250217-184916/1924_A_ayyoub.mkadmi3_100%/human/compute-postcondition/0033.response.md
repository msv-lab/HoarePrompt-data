Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a string `s`, a positive integer `k`, and another positive integer `n`. It processes the string `s` by removing characters that are not part of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and it keeps track of the last character of `s` if it was one of those `k` alphabets. After processing, the function returns a boolean indicating whether the length of a specific substring of `s1` (which contains remaining valid characters) is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the string `s2` which contains the last character of `s` if it was one of the first `k` alphabets.**
