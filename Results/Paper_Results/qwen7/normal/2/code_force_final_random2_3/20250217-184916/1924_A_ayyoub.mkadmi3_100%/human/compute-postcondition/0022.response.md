Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is a string of length `m-1` starting with the second character of the original `s`.
   - `i` is the third character of the original `s`.
   - `alphabet` is a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a+k-1' with `i` removed if `len(alphabet) != 1`.
   - If `i` is in `alphabet`, then `s` is concatenated with `i`; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - At the start of the loop, `i` is the current character being processed.
   - The loop modifies `s` based on the condition involving `i` and `alphabet`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `i` becomes the next character in the string `s`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `i` must still be within the bounds of the string `s`.

5. **Updated States**:
   - `s` will now be the string obtained after processing the first character (i.e., the second character of the original `s`).
   - `i` will be the next character in the string `s` after the first character.
   - `alphabet` remains the same unless the new `i` needs to be removed from it.

Given these points, let's determine the updated states:

- `s` will now be the string starting from the third character of the original `s` (since the first character was already processed).
- `i` will be the fourth character of the original `s` (since the first three characters were already processed).
- `alphabet` remains the same as it did not change during the first iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is a string of length `m-2` starting with the third character of the original `s`, `i` is the fourth character of the original `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a+k-1' with `i` removed if `len(alphabet) != 1`**.
