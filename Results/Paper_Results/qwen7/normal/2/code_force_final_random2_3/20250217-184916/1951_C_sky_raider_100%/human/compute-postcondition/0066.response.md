Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`
   - `t` is `t + s`
   - `k` is decreased by `s`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be `i + 1` and `n` remains the same.

5. **Other variables**:
   - `c`, `s`, `t`, and `k` are not directly controlled by the loop head, so their values remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

6. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `n` remains the same
   - `c`, `s`, `t`, and `k` retain their values from the previous iteration

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is `t + s`, `k` is decreased by `s`**.
