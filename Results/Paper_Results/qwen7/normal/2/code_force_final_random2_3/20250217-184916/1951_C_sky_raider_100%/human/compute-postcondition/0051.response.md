Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`, `t` is `n * s`, `k` is decreased by `n * s`, `i` is `n + 1`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from user input, and `c` is the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and splits them into a list using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `l`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `t`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states except that `l` now holds the newly read list of integers.
