Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be `k - n * s`, `t` will be `n * s`, `c` will be the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration, and `s` will be the minimum of `m` and the remaining value of `k`. `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will equal `n`, the variable `k` will be reduced by the total amount of `s` used over all iterations (`n * s`), the variable `t` will be equal to `n * s`, the variable `c` will contain the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration, `s` will be the minimum of `m` and the remaining value of `k` after all iterations, and `l` will remain as the sorted list of integers provided as input.
