Output State: **`c` is `s * (l[i] + t)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. Since `t` is 0, the expression simplifies to `s * l[i]`. The value of `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, and `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
