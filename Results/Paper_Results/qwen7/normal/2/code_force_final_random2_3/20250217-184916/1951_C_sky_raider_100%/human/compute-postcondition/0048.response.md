Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`.
   - `t` is `n * s`.
   - `k` is decreased by `n * s`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `c` is the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.
   - `t` is `n` times `s`.
   - After each iteration, `k` is decreased by `n * s`.
   - `i` starts from `n + 1` and remains `n + 1` after all iterations (since it is not modified further).
   - `c` is accumulated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration.

3. **Value of `c`:**
   - Since `i` is `n + 1` and does not change during the iterations, `l[i]` is `l[n + 1]`.
   - `t` is `n * s`.
   - Therefore, `c` is the sum of `s * (l[n + 1] + n * s)` for each iteration.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(int(c))`.

Given the above analysis, since `i` is `n + 1` and does not change, the value of `l[i]` is `l[n + 1]`. The value of `t` is `n * s`, and `c` is the sum of `s * (l[n + 1] + n * s)` for each iteration.

However, without knowing the exact values of `l`, `m`, `k`, `n`, and `s`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `c`. But we can describe the expression used to compute `c`.

Output: **int(s * (l[n + 1] + n * s))**
