Output State: **`c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t) + s * (l[i] + t)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus `s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is `s + s`, `i` is `i + 1 + 1`, `t` is increased by `s`.**

Explanation: 
- The initial state includes the definition of `c`, `l`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `t`, and `i`.
- The code `t += s` increases the value of `t` by `s`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
