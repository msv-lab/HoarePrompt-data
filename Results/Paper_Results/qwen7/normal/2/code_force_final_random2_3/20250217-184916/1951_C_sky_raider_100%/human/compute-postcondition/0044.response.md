Output State: **`total` is 0, `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`, `t` is `3 * s`, `c` is increased by `2 * s * (l[i + 2] + t)`, `k` is decreased by `s`, `i` is `i + 2**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`.
- After that, `c` is further increased by `s * (l[i + 2] + t)`.
- Since `t` is `3 * s`, the updated value of `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t) + s * (l[i + 2] + t)`, which simplifies to `c + s * (l[i] + 3 * s) + s * (l[i + 2] + 3 * s) = c + s * (l[i] + l[i + 2] + 6 * s)`.
- `s` remains `min(m, k)`, `k` is decreased by `s`, and `i` is `i + 2`.
