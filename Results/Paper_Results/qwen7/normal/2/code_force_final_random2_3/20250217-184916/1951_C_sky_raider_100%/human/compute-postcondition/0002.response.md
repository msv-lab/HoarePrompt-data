Output State: **`l` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `l`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state as they are not affected by the code.
