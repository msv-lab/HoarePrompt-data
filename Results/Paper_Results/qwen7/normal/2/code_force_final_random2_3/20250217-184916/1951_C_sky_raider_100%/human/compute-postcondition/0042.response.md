Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. Therefore, the variables involved are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`
   - `t` is `s + 2s`
   - `c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`
   - `k` is decreased by `s`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `c` is updated to its previous value plus `s * (l[i] + t)`
   - `k` is decreased by `s`

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `n`, we need to update `i` and ensure `n` remains unchanged (as it is a constant for the loop).

4. **Update `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was increased by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

5. **Ensure `n` remains unchanged**:
   - `n` does not change within the loop.

6. **Other variables (`total`, `s`, `t`, `c`, `k`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted**.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`, `t` is `s + 2s`, `c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`, `k` is decreased by `s`, `i` is `i + 2`, `c` is updated to its previous value plus `s * (l[i] + t)`, `k` is decreased by `s`**
