Output State: **`c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus `s`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `t` is `s + s`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

The code `k -= s` decreases the value of `k` by `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
