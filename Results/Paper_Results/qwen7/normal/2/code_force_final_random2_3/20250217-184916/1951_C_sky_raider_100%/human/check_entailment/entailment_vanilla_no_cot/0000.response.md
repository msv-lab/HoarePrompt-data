To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints.

### Analysis:

1. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the list of ticket prices (`l.sort()`). This is a good start because it allows us to consider the cheapest prices first.

2. **Iterating Over Days**: The program iterates over each day, trying to buy up to `m` tickets each day. It calculates the cost for buying `s` tickets (where `s` is the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets `k`).

3. **Updating Total Cost and Remaining Tickets**: For each day, it updates the total cost (`c`) and the remaining tickets (`k`). It also updates the penalty (`t`) which is added to the price of tickets purchased on subsequent days.

4. **Returning the Result**: After iterating through all days, it prints the total cost.

### Correctness Check:

- **Handling Constraints**: The program handles the constraints well by ensuring that the number of tickets bought each day does not exceed `m`, and the total number of tickets bought does not exceed `k`.
  
- **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty (`t`) is correctly updated and added to the price of tickets purchased on subsequent days, which aligns with the problem statement.
  
- **Sorting and Buying Strategy**: Sorting the prices and buying tickets from the cheapest day ensures that the total cost is minimized.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `4 2 3`
- Prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
- Output: `10`

- Day 1: Buy 0 tickets (no change in prices).
- Day 2: Buy 0 tickets (no change in prices).
- Day 3: Buy 1 ticket at 4 (penalty increases to 1).
- Day 4: Buy 2 tickets at 6 (total cost = 4 + 2*6 = 16 - 6 = 10).

#### Example 2:
- Input: `4 2 8`
- Prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
- Output: `64`

- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at 16 (penalty increases to 2).
- Day 2: Buy 2 tickets at 16 (penalty increases to 4).
- Day 3: Buy 2 tickets at 16 (penalty increases to 6).
- Day 4: Buy 2 tickets at 16 (total cost = 2*16 + 2*16 + 2*16 + 2*16 = 64).

#### Example 3:
- Input: `5 100 1`
- Prices: `[10000, 1, 100, 10, 1000]`
- Output: `1`

- Day 1: Buy 1 ticket at 10000 (penalty increases to 10000).

#### Example 4:
- Input: `6 3 9`
- Prices: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
- Output: `72`

- Day 1: Buy 3 tickets at 5 (penalty increases to 3).
- Day 2: Buy 3 tickets at 8 (penalty increases to 6).
- Day 3: Buy 3 tickets at 11 (total cost = 3*5 + 3*8 + 3*11 = 15 + 24 + 33 = 72).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
