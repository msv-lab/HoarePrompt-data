Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n // k + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is `0`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 3`.
   - The condition `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` holds true.

4. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n // k + 1`.
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` from its previous value.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such specification is given, `n` stays the same.

6. **Check the condition `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)`**:
   - Since `cnt` is `0` and `l` is `func_2() + 3`, the condition `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` will still hold true if `func_2()` does not return a value that makes `l == n + 1`.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `i` will be incremented by `1` from its previous value (which was part of the previous state but not explicitly given).
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `cnt` remains `0`.
- `l` remains `func_2() + 3`.

Since the exact initial value of `i` is not provided, we can assume it was `1` at the start of the first iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2`.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`cnt` is `0`, `i` is `2`, `l` is `func_2() + 3`, and the condition `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` holds true.**
