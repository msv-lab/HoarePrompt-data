Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cnt` is `k - 3`
   - `l` is `func_2() + 3`
   - The condition `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` is true.

2. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `cnt == 0`, it means `k - 3 == 0`, so `k == 3`.
   - Since `l == n + 1`, and `l` is defined as `func_2() + 3`, it implies `func_2() + 3 == n + 1`. Therefore, `func_2() == n - 2`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - To determine what is printed, we need to know the values of `i` and `v`.
   - However, the values of `i` and `v` are not provided in the initial state. We cannot determine their exact values without additional information.

Given the information provided, we can only describe the format of the output based on the variables `i` and `v`.

Output: **! [i * v]** (where `[i * v]` represents the product of `i` and `v`)
