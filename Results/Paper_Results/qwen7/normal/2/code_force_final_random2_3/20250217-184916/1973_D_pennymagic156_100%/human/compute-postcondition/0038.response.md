Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` must be greater than 0.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Here, the values of `l` and `i * v` are explicitly defined by the initial state, but `i` and `v` are not mentioned. Since no specific values are given for `i` and `v`, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we know that `l` is a value less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, the output will include the value of `l` and the product of `i` and `v`, but the exact values of `i` and `v` are unknown.

Output: **? [l] [i * v]** (where `[l]` is a value less than `n + 1` and `[i * v]` is the product of `i` and `v`)
