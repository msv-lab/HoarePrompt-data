Output State: **The program does not return any value since there is no return statement with an expression.**

Given the initial state and the code snippet, we know that the condition `(cnt == 0 and l == func_2() + 2)` holds true. However, the return statement in the code snippet does not include any expression; it simply returns without a value. Therefore, the program does not return any value.
