Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n - 1`, `v` is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the value of `n` remains unchanged, `i` is still `n - 1`, and `v` is still `n - 1`. The `break` statement does not change these values but indicates that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
