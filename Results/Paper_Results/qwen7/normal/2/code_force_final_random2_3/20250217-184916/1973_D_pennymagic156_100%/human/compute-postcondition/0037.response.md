Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.
2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `cnt` and `l`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is `cnt - 1`
   - `l` is equal to `func_2()` plus 1

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure both conditions in the loop head are satisfied:
- `cnt` should be non-zero (i.e., `cnt > 0`)
- `l` should be less than `n + 1` (i.e., `l < n + 1`)

Given the current state:
- `cnt` is `cnt - 1`, which means `cnt` has been decremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `cnt` must be greater than 0. Since `cnt` is `cnt - 1`, it means `cnt` was greater than 1 at the start of the previous iteration.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `func_2()` must return a value such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states of `cnt` and `l` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

### Adjusted States:
- `cnt` must be greater than 0.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

Since `cnt` is `cnt - 1`, we need to ensure `cnt` was greater than 1 at the start of the previous iteration. And `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0, `l` must be less than `n + 1`**
