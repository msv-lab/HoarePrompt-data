Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is initialized to `n`, `v` is `n`**.

Explanation: The code `v = i` assigns the value of `i` to `v`. Given that `i` is initialized to `n`, `v` is now also `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
