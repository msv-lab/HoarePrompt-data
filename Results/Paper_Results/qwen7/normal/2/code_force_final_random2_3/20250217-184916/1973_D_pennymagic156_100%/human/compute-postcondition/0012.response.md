Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n - 1`, and `v` is the return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_2()` to `v`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `v`. However, we know that `n` remains a positive integer within the specified range, `i` remains `n - 1`, and `v` now holds the return value from `func_2()`.
