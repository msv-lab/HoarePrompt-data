Output State: `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `func_2() + 3`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`. After each iteration, `cnt` decreases by 1, and `l` increases by 1. Given that the loop runs 3 times, `cnt` will be reduced from `k - 3` (after 3 iterations) to `0`. Meanwhile, `l` starts at `1` and increases by 1 with each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `l` will be `1 + 3 = func_2() + 3`.
