The only variable in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 1. Since 1 is less than or equal to 1000, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`i` is 1**
