Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'. Specifically, if `y` is greater than `z`, then `res` is 'peak'. If `y` is less than `z`, then `res` is 'stair'. If `y` is equal to `z`, then `res` is 'none'.
