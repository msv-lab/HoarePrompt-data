Output State: `i` is 1001, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'.

Explanation: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 1000. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, once `i` reaches 1001, the condition `i <= 1000` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate. At this point, `i` will be 1001. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be randomly generated integers between 1 and 9 during the last iteration of the loop, and `res` will be determined based on the comparison of these values as per the conditions given in the loop body.
