Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'.**

Explanation: The code `y = randint(1, 9)` generates a new random integer between 1 and 9 and assigns it to `y`. The values of `i`, `x`, `z`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
