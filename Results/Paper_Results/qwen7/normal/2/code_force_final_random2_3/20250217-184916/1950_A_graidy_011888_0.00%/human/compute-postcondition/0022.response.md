Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`**.

Explanation: The line `res = 'none'` assigns the string `'none'` to the variable `res`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `z`, or the condition that `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. Therefore, these variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
