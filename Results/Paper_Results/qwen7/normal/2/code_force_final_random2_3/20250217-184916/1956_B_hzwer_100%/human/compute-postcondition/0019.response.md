Output State: **`cnt` is a list of length `n`, `ans` is `ans + max(0, x - 1)` where `x` is the last element of `cnt` in the current iteration, and `ans` is updated by adding `max(0, x - 1)` to its current value.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the maximum of 0 and the last element of `cnt` minus 1 to its current value. The length of the list `cnt` remains `n`, and the value of `x` used in the calculation is the last element of `cnt` in the current iteration.
