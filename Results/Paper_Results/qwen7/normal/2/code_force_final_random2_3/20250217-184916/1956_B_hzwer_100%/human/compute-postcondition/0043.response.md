Output State: `cnt` must contain at least as many elements as there are items in `a`, and `ans` is increased by the maximum of 0 and `x` - 1 for each element `x` in `cnt`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will be the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in `cnt`, where `cnt` contains the count of each unique element in the list `a`. The value of `cnt` will reflect the frequency of each element in `a`, and `ans` will accumulate the adjusted counts (subtracting 1 and ensuring non-negativity) for all elements in `cnt`.
