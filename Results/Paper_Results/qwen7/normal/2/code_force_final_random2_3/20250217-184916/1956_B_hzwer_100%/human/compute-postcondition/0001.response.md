Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range of values returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**: Since `_` is just a placeholder and doesn't hold any specific value, the key thing to consider is the number of iterations the loop will perform. This is determined by the value read from `input()`.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) are in the range 1 to \(n\), with each integer from 1 to \(n\) appearing at most twice.
   - The sum of all \(n\) across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` provides a valid number of iterations. Given that `t` represents the number of test cases, the loop will run exactly `t` times.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
