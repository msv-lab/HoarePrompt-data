Output State: The list `cnt` will be a list of length `n`, and `ans` will be the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in `cnt`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `cnt` will contain the counts of each integer from the original list `a`, but reduced by 1 if the count was greater than 1. The variable `ans` will hold the total count of such reductions across all elements in `cnt`.
