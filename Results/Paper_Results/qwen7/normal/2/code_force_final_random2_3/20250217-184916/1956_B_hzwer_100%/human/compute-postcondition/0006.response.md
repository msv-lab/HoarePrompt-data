Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers; `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[x] += 1` increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers, it remains unchanged. The value of `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1, assuming `x` is a key in the dictionary `cnt`.
