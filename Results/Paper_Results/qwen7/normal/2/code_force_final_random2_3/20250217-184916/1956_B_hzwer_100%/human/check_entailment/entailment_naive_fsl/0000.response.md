Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game's rules and Nene's optimal strategy. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum number of points you can get by simply counting the excess cards (i.e., cards that appear more than once) without considering Nene's optimal moves.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
```

This happens because the program counts the excess cards (in this case, two 1s), but it does not account for Nene's optimal strategy of minimizing your score. In the optimal scenario, Nene would always pick the card that maximizes her score while minimizing yours. Here, Nene could pick one of the 1s, leaving only one 1 for you, resulting in a score of 1 for you.

The program fails to simulate this optimal behavior, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
