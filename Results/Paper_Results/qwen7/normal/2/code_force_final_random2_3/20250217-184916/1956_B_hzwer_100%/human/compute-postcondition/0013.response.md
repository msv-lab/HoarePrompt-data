Output State: **The list `a` is empty, and the list `cnt` is of length `n + 1` with each element representing the count of occurrences of each integer from the original list `a`, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` to 0. The list `a` becomes empty because all its elements have been processed. The list `cnt` retains its length of `n + 1` and continues to store the counts of each integer from the original list `a`. Since no other operations are performed on `ans`, it remains 0.
