Output State: `cnt` is a list of length `n`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in `cnt`.

In this final state, `cnt` has been reduced to a list of length `n` (since it starts as length `n+1` and is iterated over completely), and `ans` has been updated to reflect the cumulative sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each element `x` in `cnt`. This means that for each count in `cnt`, if the count was greater than 1, `max(0, x - 1)` will add `x - 1` to `ans`; otherwise, it adds 0.
