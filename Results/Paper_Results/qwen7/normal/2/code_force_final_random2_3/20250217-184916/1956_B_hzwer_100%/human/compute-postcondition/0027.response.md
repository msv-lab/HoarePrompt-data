Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in a:`. The objects involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` will take each value from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `a`.
   - During each iteration, `x` takes the value of the current element in `a`.

4. **Identify what needs to be adjusted**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each element in `a`, the list `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `x` will take the value of each element in `a` during each iteration, but its initial state before the loop doesn't need adjustment since it will change within the loop.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - The list `a` must have at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `x` will be set to each element of `a` during each iteration, but its initial state before the loop doesn't need adjustment.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must have at least one element**
