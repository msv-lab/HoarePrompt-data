Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are initialized to 0.**

The code initializes a list `cnt` of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
