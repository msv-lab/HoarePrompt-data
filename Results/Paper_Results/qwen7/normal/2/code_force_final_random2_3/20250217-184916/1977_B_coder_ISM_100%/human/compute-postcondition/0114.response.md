Output State: **`nalla` is 30, `t` must be greater than 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with length 30 containing '0' at index 0, `i` is 0, and `(x & pow(2, i))` is false.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('0')` appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially an empty list with length 30, after appending `'0'`, `s` now contains `'0'` at index 0 and remains an empty list at all other indices. All other variables (`nalla`, `t`, `x`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `(x & pow(2, i))` being false also remains unchanged.
