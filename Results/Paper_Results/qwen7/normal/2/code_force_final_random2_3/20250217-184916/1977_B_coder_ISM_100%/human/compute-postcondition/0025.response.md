Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 29, `s` is a list of length 59 where each element is either '1' or '0' based on whether `x & pow(2, i)` is true or false for each iteration from 0 to 29, `flag` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `flag` to 0. Since `flag` was not previously defined in the initial state, its value is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
