Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, length)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `length`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `length`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `length` is 30
   - If `s[1]` is '-1', no changes are made to the variables.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2 and `length` is 30, the condition `i < length` is true, meaning the loop will execute again.
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - `length` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `length` will remain 30.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `length` is 30**
