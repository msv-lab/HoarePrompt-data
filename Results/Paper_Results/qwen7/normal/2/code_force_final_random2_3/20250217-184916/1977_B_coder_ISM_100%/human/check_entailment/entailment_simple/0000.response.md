Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Bitwise Representation**: For each test case, it constructs a list `s` representing the binary representation of `x`, but with a twist to ensure the conditions are met.
3. **Condition Application**:
   - It iterates through the bits of `x` and appends '1' or '0' to `s` based on whether the bit is set.
   - It then checks for consecutive '1's and modifies the array to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - If necessary, it appends additional '0' or '1' to the end of the array to meet the constraints.
4. **Final Adjustments**: It ensures that if the last element is '0' and a flag is set, it adjusts the last few elements to meet the required conditions.
5. **Output**: The program prints the length of the array followed by the array itself.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program appears to correctly generate an array that meets the specified conditions for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
