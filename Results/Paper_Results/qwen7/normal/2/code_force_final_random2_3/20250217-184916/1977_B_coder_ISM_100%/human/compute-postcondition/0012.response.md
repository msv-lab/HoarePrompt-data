Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length 30. If `x & pow(2, i)` is true, then the first element of `s` is set to '1'. Otherwise, the first element of `s` is set to '0', and all other elements remain as empty elements.
