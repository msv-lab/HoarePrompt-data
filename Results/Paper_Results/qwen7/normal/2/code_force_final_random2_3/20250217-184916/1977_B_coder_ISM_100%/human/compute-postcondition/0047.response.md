Postcondition: `i` is 0; `flag` is either 0 or 1; the character at index 0 of string `s` is either '0' or '1'. If `flag` is 1, the character at index 1 of string `s` is not equal to the character at index 0 of string `s`. If `flag` is 0, the character at index 1 of string `s` is either not equal to '0' or '1'.
