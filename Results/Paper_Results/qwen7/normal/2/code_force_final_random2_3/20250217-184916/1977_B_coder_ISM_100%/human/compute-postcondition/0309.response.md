Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) and another positive integer \( x \) (1 ≤ \( x \) < 2^30). For each test case, it converts \( x \) into a 30-bit binary representation, modifies this binary representation according to specific rules, and then prints the length of the modified binary string along with the string itself. The final state ensures that the string has been fully processed, and no further modifications can be made based on the given conditions.**
