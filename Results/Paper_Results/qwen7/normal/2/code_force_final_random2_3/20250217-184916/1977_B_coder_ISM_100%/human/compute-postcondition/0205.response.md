Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 28.
- `length` is 29.
- `s[28]` is '0'.
- `s[27]` is '1'.
- `s[29]` is '0'.
- `flag` is 1.

The print statement `print(*s)` will print the contents of the string `s` with each character separated by a space. Given the values of the elements in `s` up to index 28 (since `length` is 29, `s` has 29 characters), the string `s` will look like this:

```
s = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX01XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX0"
```

Where 'X' represents any character other than '0', '1', or '-1', and the exact characters are not specified but do not affect the output since they are not mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX0 1 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX0**
