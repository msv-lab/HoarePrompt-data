Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of length 31 where the last element is '0'**.

The code `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the end of the list `s`. Since `s` originally had a length of 30, after appending `'0'`, its length becomes 31. All other variables remain unchanged.
