Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 29, flag is either 0 or 1, the character at index 0 of string s is '1', the characters at indices 1 through 28 of string s are either '0' or '-1' depending on the value of flag, and the character at index 29 of string s is '0' if flag is 1, and '1' if flag is 0, and the length of string s is 30.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After all iterations, `i` is 28, `length` is exactly 29, `s[28]` is '0', `s[27]` is '1', and `s[29]` is '0'. The value of `flag` is 1.

Explanation: Given the loop runs from `i` starting at 1 up to `length-1`, and considering the conditions under which the loop modifies the string `s`, the loop will continue to run until it reaches the end of the string `s`. Since `i` ends at 28, it means the loop has executed 28 times. The last modification occurs when `i` is 28, changing `s[28]` from '-1' to '0' if `s[27]` is '1'. Given the initial and intermediate states, we can infer that `s[27]` was '1' and `s[28]` was '-1' before the last iteration, and after the last iteration, `s[28]` becomes '0'. The value of `flag` is set to 1 because `s[29]` is '0' after the loop completes, indicating that the condition for setting `flag` to 1 was met during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: flag is 0, i is 30, length is 31, and the string s has been transformed such that every instance of '-1' followed by '1' has been processed according to the loop's rule, with the final state being that no further changes can be made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
