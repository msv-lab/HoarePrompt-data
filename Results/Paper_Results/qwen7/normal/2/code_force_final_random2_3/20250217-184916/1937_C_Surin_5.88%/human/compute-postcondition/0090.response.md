Output State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the final input string after all iterations, `prev` is `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string, and the current value of `r` is '>'**

Explanation: The line `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
