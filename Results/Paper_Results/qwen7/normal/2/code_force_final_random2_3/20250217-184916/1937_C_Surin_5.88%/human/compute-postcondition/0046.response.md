Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be at least 2.
- `r` is an input string.
- `prev` is equal to `i`.
- `i` is equal to `n`.

We need to determine the values of the variables used in the `print` statement.

1. The value of `i` is `n`.
2. The value of `prev` is `i`, so `prev` is also `n`.
3. There is no explicit value given for `v1`, but it is used in the `print` statement. Since `v1` is not defined elsewhere in the provided information, we cannot determine its value precisely without additional context.

Given this, the `print` statement will output a string with placeholders for `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`. Since `i` and `prev` both have the value `n`, the output will be:

Output: **? [v1] n [v1] n**
