Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 2 (though its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement).
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `v2` is explicitly given as 3.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state, it is not provided. Therefore, the placeholders `{v1}` will remain as they are in the output string.

So, the output will be:
Output: **'? {v1} {v1} 3 3'**
