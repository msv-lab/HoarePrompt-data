Output State: **`g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `g`, `v1`, and `v2`. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means it ensures that any buffered data is written out to the terminal immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or their states are altered by this command, the values of `g`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.
