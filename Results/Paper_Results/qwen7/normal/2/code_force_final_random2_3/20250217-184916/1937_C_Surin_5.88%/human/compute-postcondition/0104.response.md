Output State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the input string, `prev` is `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `i` is updated to be equal to `prev`.**

Explanation: The line `prev = i` updates the value of `prev` to be the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
