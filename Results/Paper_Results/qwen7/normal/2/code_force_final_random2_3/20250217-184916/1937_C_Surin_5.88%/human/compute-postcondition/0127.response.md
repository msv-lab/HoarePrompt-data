Based on the initial state provided:

- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is `i`.
- `v2` is `i`.
- The input string `r` has been set to `<`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Here, `v1` and `v2` both have the same value, which is `i`. Since `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, it remains as `i`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **? i i i i**
