Based on the initial state provided, we know that `n` must be at least 2. However, the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine their exact values. 

Given the format of the `print` statement, it appears that `v1` is mentioned twice, and `i` and `prev` are also included. Since these values are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of their roles or the context they might come from.

Output: **? v1 i v1 prev**
