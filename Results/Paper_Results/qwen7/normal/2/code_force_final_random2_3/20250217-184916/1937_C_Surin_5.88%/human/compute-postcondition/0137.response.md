Output State: **`g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, `v2` is `i`, `r` is an input string from the user.**

The code `r = input('')` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `r`. The values of `g`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged. `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer but does not affect the variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated variable `r` which now holds the input string, while `g`, `v1`, and `v2` retain their original values.
