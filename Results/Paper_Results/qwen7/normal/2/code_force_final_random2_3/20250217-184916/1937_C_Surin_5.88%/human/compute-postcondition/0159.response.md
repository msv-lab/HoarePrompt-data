Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `prev` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head)

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 2 to 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
