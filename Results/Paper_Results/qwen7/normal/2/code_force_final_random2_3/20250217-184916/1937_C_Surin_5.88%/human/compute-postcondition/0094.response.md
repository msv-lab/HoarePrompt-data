Based on the initial state provided:

- `g` is 0
- `n` is an input integer which is at least 2
- `r` is the final input string after all iterations (current value is '>')
- `prev` is `i + 1`
- `i` is less than `n`
- `kp` is 1
- `v1` is `n-1`
- `v2` is `n-1`

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Let's break down the values that will be printed:

- `v1` is `n-1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `v1` will be `n-1`.
- `i` is less than `n`, so it could be any integer from 0 to `n-1` (exclusive).
- `prev` is `i + 1`. Since `i` is less than `n`, `prev` will be an integer from 1 to `n`.

Given these values, the print statement will output a string with the following format:
- The first `{v1}` will be replaced by `n-1`.
- The second `{i}` will be replaced by the current value of `i`.
- The third `{v1}` will again be replaced by `n-1`.
- The fourth `{prev}` will be replaced by `i + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? [n-1] [i] [n-1] [i+1]'**
