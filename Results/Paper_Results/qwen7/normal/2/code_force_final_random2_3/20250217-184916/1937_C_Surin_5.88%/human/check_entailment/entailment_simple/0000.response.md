### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query compares \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The XOR operation is maximized when the bits differ as much as possible.
   - The OR operation tends to produce higher values when there are more set bits in the numbers involved.
   - By comparing \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\), we can infer information about the relative values of the elements in the permutation.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code starts by fixing \(v1 = 0\) and comparing it with all other elements \(i\) in the range \(1\) to \(n-1\).
     - It prints a query `? 0 0 i i` to compare \((p_0 \mid p_0)\) and \((p_i \mid p_i)\), which always results in equality.
     - Then, it prints a query `? 0 i 0 i` to compare \((p_0 \mid p_0)\) and \((p_i \mid p_i)\), again resulting in equality.
     - The purpose seems to be to find an element \(v1\) that is likely to have the highest possible value when compared with other elements.
   - After finding \(v1\), it iterates through all elements \(i\) from \(1\) to \(n-1\) and compares them with \(v1\) using the query `? v1 i v1 prev`.
     - This step aims to find an element \(prev\) that has a higher OR value with \(v1\) compared to other elements.
   - Finally, it prints the answer `! prev v1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of finding \(v1\) by comparing \((p_0 \mid p_0)\) and \((p_i \mid p_i)\) is flawed because these comparisons always yield equality.
   - The subsequent step of finding \(prev\) by comparing \((p_v1 \mid p_i)\) and \((p_v1 \mid p_prev)\) also seems to be based on a misunderstanding of how to maximize the XOR value.
   - The algorithm does not correctly leverage the information from the OR comparisons to identify the pair \((i, j)\) that maximizes the XOR value.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the strategy to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
