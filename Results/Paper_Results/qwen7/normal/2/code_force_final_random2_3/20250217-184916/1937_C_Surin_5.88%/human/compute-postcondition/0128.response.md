Output State: **`g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`, and the command `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, since no output is explicitly generated by this line of code, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and the fact that the flush operation has been performed.
