Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to follow the problem description effectively. Specifically, the program does not ensure that it uses at most \(3n\) queries to find the pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. Instead, it seems to use a fixed pattern of queries that does not guarantee the optimal number of queries.

Here's a specific case where the program might fail:

Consider a permutation \(p = [0, 1, 2, 3]\). The maximum XOR value is \(3 \oplus 2 = 1 \oplus 0 = 3\).

The program starts by comparing pairs of indices in a way that does not necessarily cover all possible pairs efficiently. For instance, the first set of queries:
```
? 0 0 1 1
? 1 1 2 2
? 2 2 3 3
```
These queries only compare pairs of the same index, which is not useful for finding the maximum XOR. The subsequent queries also do not cover all possible pairs efficiently.

A more effective approach would involve a strategy to systematically explore all pairs of indices to maximize the number of useful comparisons within the limit of \(3n\) queries. The current implementation does not appear to achieve this goal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
