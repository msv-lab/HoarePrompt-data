Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `prev` is `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4
- `v1` is `n-1`
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `r` is an input string that was never equal to '>' during the loop execution

The `print` statement is `f'! {prev} {v1}'`.

Given that both `prev` and `v1` are equal to `n-1`, the output will be:

Output: **! n-1 n-1**
