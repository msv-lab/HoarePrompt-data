Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means it ensures that any buffered data is written to the terminal immediately. However, since no variables are updated or assigned in this line of code, their values remain unchanged.
