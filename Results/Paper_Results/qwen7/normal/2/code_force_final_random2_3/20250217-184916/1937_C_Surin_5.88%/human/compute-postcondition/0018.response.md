Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, this operation does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, and `v2`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
