Output State: **`v1` is equal to `v2`, `v2` is equal to `i`, `i` retains its original value, `r` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Since `v2` is equal to `i`, `v1` now also holds the value of `i`. The values of `i` and `r` remain unchanged.
