Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `i + 1`.
   - `v2` is `i`.
   - `v1` is equal to the input string `r` if `r` is equal to '<'.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

To determine what will be printed, we need to figure out the values of `v1` and `v2`.

- Since `v1` is set to `i + 1` and `v1` is also set to the input string `r` if `r` is equal to '<', we need to know the value of `r` to determine `v1`.
- If `r` is not '<', then `v1` will be `i + 1`.
- If `r` is '<', then `v1` will be the string '<'.
- `v2` is simply `i`.

Without knowing the specific value of `r`, we can consider both cases:

### Case 1: `r` is not '<'
- `v1` = `i + 1`
- `v2` = `i`

The print statement will output:
```
? i+1 i+1 i i
```

### Case 2: `r` is '<'
- `v1` = '<'
- `v2` = `i`

The print statement will output:
```
? < < i i
```

Since the problem does not specify the value of `r`, we need to consider both possibilities. However, based on the format requirement, we should provide the most precise description possible.

Output: **? [i+1] [i+1] [i] [i]** (if `r` is not '<') or **? < < [i] [i]** (if `r` is '<')
