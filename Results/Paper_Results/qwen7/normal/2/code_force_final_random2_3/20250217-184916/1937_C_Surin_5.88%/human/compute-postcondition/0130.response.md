Output State: **`g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`, `v1` is equal to `r` (the input string)**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Since `v2` is equal to `i`, `v1` is now also equal to `i`. Additionally, `v2` remains unchanged and is still equal to `i`. The value of `g` and the input string `r` remain unchanged.
