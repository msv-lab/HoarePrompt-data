Based on the initial state provided:

- `g` is 0
- `n` is an input integer which is at least 2
- `r` is the input string from the last iteration
- `prev` is equal to `n`
- `i` is 2
- `kp` is 1
- `v1` is 0
- `v2` is 1

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Here, `v1` is explicitly given as 0, and `v2` is explicitly given as 1. The values of `v1` and `v2` do not depend on any other variables or conditions in the current context.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
