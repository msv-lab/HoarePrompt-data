Output State: **`t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is a tuple with at least `n + 3` elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v * (v > z - y) + b[-2] + v * (v > x - w)]` extended for each iteration, `v` is `y - x`, `u` is `u - 1`, `c` is the first value returned by `r()`, `d` is the second value returned by `r()`, `c` and `d` are updated to the values returned by `r()`**.

Explanation: The code `c, d = r()` assigns the values returned by the function `r()` to `c` and `d`. Since `r()` returns two values, `c` and `d` are updated to these values. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
