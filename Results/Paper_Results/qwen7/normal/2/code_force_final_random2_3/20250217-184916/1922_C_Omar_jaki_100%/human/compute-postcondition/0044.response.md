Output State: `u` is `0`, `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is a tuple with at least `n + 3` elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v * (v > z - y) + b[-2] + v * (v > x - w)]` extended for each iteration, `v` is `y - x`, `c` and `d` are updated to the values returned by `r()`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `u` will be reduced to `0` since it is decremented by `1` in each iteration and starts from a positive value. The variable `t` will be reduced by `2 * n` for each iteration, so after all iterations, it will be `t - 2 * n`. The tuple `a` and list `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The values of `v`, `c`, and `d` will be updated to the last values returned by the function `r()`.
