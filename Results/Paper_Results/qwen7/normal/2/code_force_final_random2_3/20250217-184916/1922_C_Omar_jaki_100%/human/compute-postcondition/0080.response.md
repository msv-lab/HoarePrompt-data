To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `u` is at least 0.
   - `c` is the return value of `r()`.
   - `d` is the second return value of `r()`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `c` and `d` are the results of calling the function `r()`. Since the function `r()` returns two values, let's denote these values as `(c_val, d_val)`, where `c_val` is the first return value and `d_val` is the second return value.
- Therefore, `c = c_val` and `d = d_val`.

The expression inside the print statement is:
```python
b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]
```

Substituting `d` and `c` with their respective values:
```python
b[(d_val - 1) * 2] - b[(c_val - 1) * 2]
```

This expression calculates the difference between the element at index `(d_val - 1) * 2` and the element at index `(c_val - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.

Since the exact values of `c_val` and `d_val` are not provided, we can only express the result in terms of these values.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **b[(d_val - 1) * 2] - b[(c_val - 1) * 2]**
