Output State: `u` is `0`, `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is a tuple with at least `n + 3` elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v * (v > z - y) + b[-2] + v * (v > x - w)]` extended for each iteration, `v` is `y - x`, `c` and `d` are updated to the values returned by `r()`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `u` will have been decremented until it reaches `0`. The loop will stop executing once `u` is `0`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `c`, and `d` will remain as described in the final output state after 3 iterations, since these variables are not modified within the loop body beyond their initial updates.
