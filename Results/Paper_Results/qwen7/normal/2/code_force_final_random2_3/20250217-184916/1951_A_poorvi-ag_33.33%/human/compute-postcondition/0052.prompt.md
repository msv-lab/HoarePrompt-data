Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, and `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
        results.append('no')
    if arr.count('1') % 2 == 0:
        if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        else:
            results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered by the user as a string, and the `results` list contains 'yes' if the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`, and 'no' otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, and `results` list is ['no', 'yes'] if the count of '1' in `arr` is not exactly 2 or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and ['no', 'no'] if the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, and `results` is either ['no', 'no'] or ['no', 'yes'] depending on whether the condition `arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr` is true. If the condition is true, `results` remains ['no', 'yes']; if the condition is false, `results` remains unchanged as ['no', 'no'], and 'no' is appended to the `results` list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
