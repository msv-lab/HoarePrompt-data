Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, `results` list is ['no']**.

The code `results.append('no')` appends the string `'no'` to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
