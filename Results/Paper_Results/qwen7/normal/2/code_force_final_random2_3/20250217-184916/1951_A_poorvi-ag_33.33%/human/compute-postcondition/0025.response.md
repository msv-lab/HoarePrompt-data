Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables `i` and `t`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `start` is an integer
   - `end` is an integer
   - `t` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `arr` is the value entered by the user as a string
   - `results` list contains 'yes' if the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`, and 'no' otherwise

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `t`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is defined outside the loop.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `t` remains the same (it was greater than or equal to 1 initially and remains so).

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered by the user as a string, and the `results` list contains 'yes' if the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`, and 'no' otherwise.**
