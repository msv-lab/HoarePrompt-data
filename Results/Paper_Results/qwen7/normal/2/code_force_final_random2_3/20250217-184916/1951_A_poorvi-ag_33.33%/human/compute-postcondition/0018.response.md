Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered by the user as a string, and the results list contains 'no'. If the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`, then the results list remains unchanged. Otherwise, the results list changes to contain 'yes'.
