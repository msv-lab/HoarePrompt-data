Output State: The `results` list will contain 'no' repeated `t` times, where `t` is the total number of iterations the loop executed. The values of `start`, `end`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` will be as they were last updated during the final iteration of the loop.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will consist of 'no' repeated `t` times. This means that regardless of the inputs provided in each iteration, the loop always appends 'no' to the `results` list. The values of `start`, `end`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` will reflect their state after the last iteration of the loop.
