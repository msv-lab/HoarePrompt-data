Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, `results` list is ['no', 'no']**.

Explanation: The code appends the string 'no' to the `results` list. Initially, `results` is a list containing one element 'no'. After appending 'no', the `results` list now contains two elements: ['no', 'no']. All other variables remain unchanged.
