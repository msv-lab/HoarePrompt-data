Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for r in results`. The variables involved in the loop head are `r` and `results`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the variable `r` should be the next element in the `results` list.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - No specific values for `r` or `results` are given, so we assume `r` is the current element being processed and `results` is the list from which `r` is being taken.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `r` is the current element, the next element in the list `results` will be the new value of `r`.
   - The list `results` will have one less element because the current element `r` has been processed.

Given these points, we can conclude:

- `r` will be the next element in the list `results`.
- `results` will be the list without the current element `r`.

Since no specific values were provided for `r` and `results`, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **`r` is the next element in the list `results`, `results` is the list without the current element `r`**
