Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, `results` is ['no', 'no'], and `results.append('no')` appends 'no' to the list `results`.**

Explanation: The code `results.append('no')` appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` is set to `['no', 'no']`. After appending `'no'`, `results` becomes `['no', 'no', 'no']`. However, since the initial state of `results` was already `['no', 'no']`, appending `'no'` does not change its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the action of appending `'no'` to the list `results`.
