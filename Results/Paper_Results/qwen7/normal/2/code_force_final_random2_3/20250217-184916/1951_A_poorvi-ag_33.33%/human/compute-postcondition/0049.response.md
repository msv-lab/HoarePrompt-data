Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, and `results` list is either ['no', 'no'] or ['no', 'yes'] depending on the condition `arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr`. If the condition is true, `results` remains ['no', 'yes']; if the condition is false, `results` remains unchanged as ['no', 'no']. If the condition is false, 'no' is appended to the `results` list.
