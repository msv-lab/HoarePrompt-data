Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been XORed with `val`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`**

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` performs an XOR operation between the `i-th` element of the list `a` (denoted as `ai`) and the value `val`. This modifies the `i-th` element of the list `a`. The variable `op` is defined as `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, which means `op` is updated based on the bitwise operations involving `val`, but the list `a` is the only variable directly modified by the given code snippet.
