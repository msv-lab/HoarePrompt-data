Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `val`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `a`: Since `val` is being taken from `a` in each iteration, and the postcondition mentions that `a` contains at least one element, we need to ensure that `a` still contains at least one element for the next iteration.
   - `op`: The value of `op` is updated based on the current `val` and `i`, but since we don't know the exact value of `i`, we cannot predict the exact new value of `op`. However, we know that `op` is updated based on the current `val`.
   - `cnt`: The count `cnt` is incremented if `op` is false. Therefore, for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `cnt` is incremented if `op` is false.

Given these points, let's formulate the state adjustments:

- `a` must still contain at least one element for the next iteration.
- `op` is updated based on the current `val` and `i`, so it remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `cnt` is incremented if `op` is false, so for the next iteration, `cnt` should be incremented if `op` is false.

Therefore, the state adjustments are:

State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1`, where `val` is the next element in the list `a` and `i` is an unspecified integer, and `cnt` is increased by 1 if `op` is false.**
