Output State: **`i` is 28, `u` is 1, `v` is the sum of [(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a], `u` is not 0, and the current value of `v` modulo 2 is not 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the variables `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The conditions for `u` and `v` also remain the same as they were in the initial state.
