Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and `cnt`, `val` is undefined, `op` is the final result of XORing the i-th bit of each element in `a` with itself, and `cnt` is the total number of times `op` became `False` during the loop executions.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `cnt`. The other variables (`val`, `op`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.
