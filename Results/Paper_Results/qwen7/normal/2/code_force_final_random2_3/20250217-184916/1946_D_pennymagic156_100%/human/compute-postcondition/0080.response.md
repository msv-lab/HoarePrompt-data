Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, op is the result of op xor (val right shifted by i bits and then bitwise ANDed with 1)**

Explanation: The given operation `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op`. Here's what each part does:
- `val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise right shift on `val` by `i` positions and then applies a bitwise AND with 1. This effectively extracts the `i`-th bit from `val`.
- The `^=` operator then performs a bitwise XOR between the current value of `op` and the result of the above operation.

Since the initial state of `a` is a non-empty list and there are no changes mentioned for `a`, it remains a non-empty list. The value of `op` is updated based on the operation described.
