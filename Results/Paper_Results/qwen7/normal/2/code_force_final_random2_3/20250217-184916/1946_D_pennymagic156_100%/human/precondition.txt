t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and x, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30. Additionally, each test case includes an array a of length n, where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30 for all elements a_i in the array. The sum of the values of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
