Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with the next `val`. `op` is now the XOR of the original `op` with `val >> i & 1`. `t` is a list with one additional element which is the result of `ai ^ val`. If `op` is `0`, `t` has an additional element appended which is the result of `ai ^ val`.
