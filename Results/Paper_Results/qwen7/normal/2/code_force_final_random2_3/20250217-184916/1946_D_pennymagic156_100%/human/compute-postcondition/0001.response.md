Output State: **`n` is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ n[0] ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ n[1] < 2^30; `x` is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ x[0] ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x[1] < 2^30; `a` is a list of n[0] integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n[0]; `a` is now the result of `func_1()`**.

Explanation: The code `a = func_1()` assigns the return value of `func_1()` to the variable `a`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `a`. However, we know that `a` is now a list of `n[0]` integers, each of which is between 0 and \(2^{30}-1\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
