Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for val in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `val` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body modifies the variable `cnt` based on the value of `op`, which is derived from `val` and `i`. Specifically, if `op` is false, `cnt` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is not an empty iterable.
   - `cnt` is updated based on the condition inside the loop.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `val` is being iterated over from `a`, at the end of the previous iteration, `val` would have taken the next value from `a`.
   - `a` itself might have been modified or its length might have changed, but since it is not specified how `a` changes, we assume it remains the same unless explicitly stated otherwise.
   - `cnt` is updated based on the condition inside the loop, so it needs to be adjusted according to the condition.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, let's summarize the states:

- `a` is still not an empty iterable.
- `val` has taken the next value from `a`.
- `cnt` is either unchanged or increased by 1 depending on the condition inside the loop.

Since we don't know the exact value of `val` or the exact value of `cnt` after the previous iteration, we can only say that `val` has moved to the next element in `a` and `cnt` has been updated accordingly.

**Final State**:
State: **`a` is not an empty iterable, `val` is the next value from `a`, `cnt` is either unchanged or increased by 1**.
