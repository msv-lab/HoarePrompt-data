Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `val`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing an XOR operation with `val`.
   - `op` remains unchanged and is currently `False`.
   - `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the first element of `a` with `val`.
   - `ai` is 0.

3. **Determine the next value of `val`**: Since the loop iterates over each element of `a`, the next value of `val` will be the next element in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `val` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `op` remains unchanged and is still `False`.
   - `t` will have one additional element, which is the XOR of the next element in `a` with `val`.
   - `ai` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with `val`, `op` remains unchanged and is currently `False`, `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the next element of `a` with `val`, and `ai` is 1**.
