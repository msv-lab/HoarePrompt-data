Output State: **`i` is 27, `u` is 0, and `v` is even. The current value of `v` satisfies the condition that `v % 2`, meaning `v` is odd. We continue the loop or iteration we were in.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `i`, `u`, or `v`, their values remain the same. The only effect is that the loop continues to the next iteration.
