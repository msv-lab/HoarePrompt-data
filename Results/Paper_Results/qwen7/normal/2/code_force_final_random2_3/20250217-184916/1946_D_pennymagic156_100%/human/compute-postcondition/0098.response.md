Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with the next `val`, `op` is now the XOR of the original `op` with `val >> i & 1`, `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the next element of `a` with the next `val`, and `ai` is the result of `ai ^ val`, `t` has an additional element appended which is the result of `ai ^ val`.**

This means that the list `t` has had one more element added to it, which is the result of `ai` XORed with `val`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
