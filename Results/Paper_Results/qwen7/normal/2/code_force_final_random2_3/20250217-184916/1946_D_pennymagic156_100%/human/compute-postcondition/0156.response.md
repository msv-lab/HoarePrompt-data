Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been XORed with the next `val`, and `val` is the next element from `a`; `ai` is updated to be the current `ai` XORed with the next `val`; `t` is a list containing one additional element which is the updated `ai`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the current value of `ai` to the list `t`. Since `ai` is updated to be the current `ai` XORed with the next `val`, the new value of `ai` is added to `t`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
