Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with `val`, `op` is now `val >> i & 1` (where `i` is the current index during the iteration), and `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the next element of `a` with `val`, and `ai` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation with `val` shifted right by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1. This means `op` is updated based on the `i`-th bit of `val`. Since `i` is not specified, we assume it's part of an iterative process where `i` changes with each iteration. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
