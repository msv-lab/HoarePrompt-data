Output State: **`i` is 28, `u` is 1, `v` is even, and `v` is not 0, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `op` and `cnt` to 0. The values of `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `op` and `cnt`, along with the unchanged values of `i`, `u`, and `v`.
