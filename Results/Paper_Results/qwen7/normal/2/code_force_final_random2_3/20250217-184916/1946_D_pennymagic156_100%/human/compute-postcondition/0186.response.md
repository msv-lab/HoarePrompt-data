Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` XOR the i-th bit of `val`, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the result of `op` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the i-th bit of `val`. After this operation, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the result of `op` is `False`. The values of `a`, `val`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
