Output State: **`ans` is 1, `s` is a string containing the substring 'ap'**

Explanation: The code replaces the substring 'map' in `s` with its parts before 'm' and after 'p', effectively removing 'm' and 'a'. Initially, `s` contains the substring 'map'. After executing the code, `s` becomes 'ap'. The variable `ans` remains unchanged with the value 1.
