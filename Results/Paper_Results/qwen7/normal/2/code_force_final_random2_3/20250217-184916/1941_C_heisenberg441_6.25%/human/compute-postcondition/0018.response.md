The loop condition is based on the expression `s.find('pie') != -1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the expression `s.find('pie') != -1` must evaluate to `True` at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `s` contains the substring 'pi'. To ensure that the loop can execute again, `s` must still contain the substring 'pie' at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `s` still contains the substring 'pie' for the loop to continue.

State: **`ans` is 4, `s` must contain the substring 'pie'**
