Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `s.find('map') != -1`. This means the loop continues as long as the substring 'map' is found within the string `s`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `ans` is 2
   - `s` is a string containing the substring 'ap'

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, `s.find('map')` must not return `-1`. This means 'map' must be present in `s`.
   - Since `s` currently contains the substring 'ap', we need to ensure that 'map' is still present in `s` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `s` contains 'ap' but not necessarily 'map', we need to adjust the state such that 'map' is still present in `s`.

4. **Possible adjustments**:
   - We cannot change `ans` because it is not part of the loop head.
   - We need to ensure that `s` still contains 'map'. Therefore, `s` should not have been modified in such a way that 'map' is no longer a substring.

Since the only information we have about `s` is that it contains 'ap' and we need to ensure 'map' is still present, we can conclude that `s` must still contain 'map'.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `s` still contains 'map'.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 2, `s` must contain the substring 'map'**
