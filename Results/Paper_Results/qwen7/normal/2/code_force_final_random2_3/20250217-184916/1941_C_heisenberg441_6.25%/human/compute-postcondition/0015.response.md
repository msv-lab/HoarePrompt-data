Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `s.find('pie') != -1`. This means the loop will continue as long as the substring 'pie' is found in `s`.

2. **Current State Before the Loop**: 
   - `ans` is 3.
   - `s` is a string that no longer contains the substring 'map'.

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**: For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must contain the substring 'pie' at the start of the loop.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `ans` is 3, it indicates that the substring 'pie' was found and removed 3 times. However, this information is not directly relevant to the loop condition `s.find('pie') != -1`.
   - The crucial part is ensuring that `s` contains the substring 'pie' at the start of the loop so that the loop can execute at least once.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `s` to ensure it contains the substring 'pie' at the start of the loop.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 3, `s` must contain the substring 'pie'**
