Reasoning:
1. The annotated program logic is flawed in its handling of the substrings "pie" and "map".
2. The function `func_1` is designed to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful by removing occurrences of "map" and "pie".
3. The logic for removing "map" is correct: it finds "map", removes it, and increments the counter.
4. However, the logic for removing "pie" is incorrect. It assumes that finding "pie" and removing it will leave the string without further occurrences of "pie", which is not necessarily true. For example, the string "piepie" would incorrectly result in "pie" being removed twice, leading to an incorrect count.
5. To fix this, we need to ensure that we only remove the minimum necessary characters to eliminate both "map" and "pie" completely.

Given the above points, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the removal of "pie" and may lead to an overcount of deletions.

Correctness: **False**
