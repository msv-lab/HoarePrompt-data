You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of s (denoted as n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6.
def func_1(s):
    if (s == 'mapie') :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of s (denoted as n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6, and s is not equal to 'mapie'
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 3, `s` is a string that no longer contains the substring 'map'.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'map' is found in `s`. After each iteration, the substring 'map' is removed, and `ans` is incremented by 1. Since the loop stops when 'map' is no longer found in `s`, and we know that after 3 iterations, `s` no longer contains 'map', it means that the entire process of removing 'map' has been completed. Therefore, `ans` will be 3, indicating that the substring 'map' was found and removed 3 times, and `s` will be the final string without any occurrences of 'map'.
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 6, `s` no longer contains the substring 'pi'.
    #
    #Explanation: Given the loop continues as long as the substring 'pie' is found in `s`, and after each iteration, the substring 'pie' is removed from `s` and `ans` is incremented by 1, we can deduce the following:
    #
    #- After 3 iterations, `s` contained the substring 'pi' and `ans` was 6.
    #- Since the loop condition checks for 'pie' and removes it, the loop would continue until 'pie' is no longer found in `s`.
    #- After the 3rd iteration, since the loop condition is still met (because `s` contains 'pi'), the loop would continue to the 4th iteration, removing 'pie' and incrementing `ans` to 7.
    #- This process would continue until 'pie' is no longer found in `s`.
    #
    #Since the problem states that after 3 iterations, `s` still contained 'pi', and the loop would continue to remove 'pie' until it is no longer present, the final state would be that `s` no longer contains 'pie', and `ans` is 6, as the loop would stop after the 3rd iteration when it finds that 'pie' is no longer present in `s`. However, based on the provided information, it seems there might be a misunderstanding because the loop should stop once 'pie' is not found, but the given states suggest it continues. Assuming the correct behavior, the loop would stop after the 3rd iteration with `s` no longer containing 'pie'.
    return ans
    #The program returns 6, and the string `s` no longer contains the substring 'pi'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `s` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6. The function returns 1 if the string `s` does not contain the substring 'pi'. If the string `s` contains the substring 'pi', the function returns 6 and removes all occurrences of the substring 'pi' from `s`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns 6, and the string `s` no longer contains the substring 'pi'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
