Output State: **`ans` is 4, `s` contains the substring 'pi'**

Explanation: The code replaces the substring 'pie' in `s` with the substring before 'pie' concatenated with the substring after 'pie'. Since `s` originally must contain the substring 'pie', after the operation, 'pie' is removed from `s`. The only part of 'pie' that remains in `s` is 'pi'. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
