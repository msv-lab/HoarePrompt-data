Output State: `ans` is 3, `s` is a string that no longer contains the substring 'map'.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'map' is found in `s`. After each iteration, the substring 'map' is removed, and `ans` is incremented by 1. Since the loop stops when 'map' is no longer found in `s`, and we know that after 3 iterations, `s` no longer contains 'map', it means that the entire process of removing 'map' has been completed. Therefore, `ans` will be 3, indicating that the substring 'map' was found and removed 3 times, and `s` will be the final string without any occurrences of 'map'.
