Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `ac` is 1 if `i` was 'A' in the previous iteration, and `bc` is 1 if `i` was not 'A'.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `ac` will remain 1 if `i` was 'A' in the previous iteration, otherwise it will remain 0.
   - `bc` will remain 1 if `i` was not 'A' in the previous iteration, otherwise it will remain 0.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `s` remains a non-empty string.
   - `ac` and `bc` will depend on the current character `i` in the next iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ac` is 1 if the previous `i` was 'A', and `bc` is 1 if the previous `i` was not 'A'**.
