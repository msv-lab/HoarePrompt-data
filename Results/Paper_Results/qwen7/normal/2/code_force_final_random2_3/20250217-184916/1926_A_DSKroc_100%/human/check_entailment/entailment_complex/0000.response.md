Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This is evident from the loop that iterates `t` times.

2. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the input string. This is done using two counters, `ac` and `bc`.

3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the characters, the program compares the counts. If 'A' is more frequent, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. This logic is implemented correctly with the conditional statement.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases where the input string can be composed of any combination of 'A' and 'B', including cases where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal (in which case the program would print 'A' since 'A' is lexicographically smaller).

5. **Distinct Strings**: The problem statement mentions that all strings are distinct, but the program does not need to handle this explicitly since it processes each string independently.

6. **No Return Value**: The problem does not require a return value, and the program does not return anything after processing all test cases, which is fine.

Given these points, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
