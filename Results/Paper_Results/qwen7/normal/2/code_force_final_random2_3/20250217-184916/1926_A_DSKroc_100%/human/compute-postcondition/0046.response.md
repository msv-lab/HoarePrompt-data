Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is 3 if `i` is 'A', and 2 otherwise, and `bc` is 1 if `i` is 'A', and 2 otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `ac += 1` increments the value of `ac` by 1. Since the initial value of `ac` is 2 if `i` is 'A' and 1 otherwise, after executing the code, `ac` will become 3 if `i` is 'A' (2 + 1) and 2 otherwise (1 + 1). The value of `bc` remains unchanged because the code only affects `ac`.
