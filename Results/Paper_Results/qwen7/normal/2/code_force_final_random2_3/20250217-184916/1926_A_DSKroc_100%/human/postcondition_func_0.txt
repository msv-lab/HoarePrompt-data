The function processes an integer `t` (where `1 ≤ t ≤ 32`) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints 'A' if the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', otherwise it prints 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return anything.
