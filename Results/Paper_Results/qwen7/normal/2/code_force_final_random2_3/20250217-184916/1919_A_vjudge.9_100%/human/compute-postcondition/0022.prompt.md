Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, t is an integer input from the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd after the if-else block executes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, and the absolute difference between `a` and `b` remains either even or odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, and the absolute difference between `a` and `b` remains either even or odd; regardless of the condition, `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
