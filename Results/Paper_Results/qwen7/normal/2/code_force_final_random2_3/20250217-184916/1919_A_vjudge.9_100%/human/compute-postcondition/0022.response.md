Output State: The value of `t` is exactly equal to the number of times the loop has executed, `i` equals `t`, and both `a` and `b` have been updated to the last set of integer inputs provided by the user within the loop. After all iterations, the absolute difference between the final values of `a` and `b` will be either even or odd based on the last input provided, and the loop has completed its execution.

This means that `t` will reflect the total number of iterations, `i` will be equal to `t`, and `a` and `b` will hold the values from the last input provided to the loop.
