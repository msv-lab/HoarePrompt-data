Functionality: **The function reads multiple pairs of non-negative integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\)) from the user, checks if the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is even or odd, and prints "Bob" if the difference is even, otherwise prints "Alice". The function does not return any value.**
