You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is greater than 0, `i` equals `t`, and `a` and `b` are integers from the input for each iteration, with their absolute difference being either even or odd as determined by the if-else block.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - The key observation here is that the game involves a series of moves where players can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.
   - The critical insight is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference between `a` and `b` determines the winner:
     - If `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob wins.
     - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Implementation:**
   - The program correctly calculates `abs(a - b)` and checks if it is even or odd.
   - Based on the result, it prints "Bob" or "Alice".

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Case when `abs(a - b)` is even:**
  - If `abs(a - b)` is even, the game will always end with Bob winning because the parity of the difference remains even after each move (each move reduces the difference by at least 1).
  - This is because the game alternates between players, and since the difference starts even and each move reduces it by at least 1, the last player to make a move will be Bob.

- **Case when `abs(a - b)` is odd:**
  - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, the game will always end with Alice winning because the parity of the difference remains odd after each move.
  - Similar to the previous case, the game alternates between players, and since the difference starts odd and each move reduces it by at least 1, the last player to make a move will be Alice.

### Conclusion:

The logic implemented in the program is correct based on the given problem description and the detailed analysis above.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
