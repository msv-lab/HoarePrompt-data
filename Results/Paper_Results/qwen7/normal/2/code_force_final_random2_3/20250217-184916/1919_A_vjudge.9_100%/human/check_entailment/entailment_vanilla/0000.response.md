Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - The key observation here is that the game involves a series of moves where players can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.
   - The critical insight is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference between `a` and `b` determines the winner:
     - If `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob wins.
     - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Implementation:**
   - The program correctly calculates `abs(a - b)` and checks if it is even or odd.
   - Based on the result, it prints "Bob" or "Alice".

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Case when `abs(a - b)` is even:**
  - If `abs(a - b)` is even, the game will always end with Bob winning because the parity of the difference remains even after each move (each move reduces the difference by at least 1).
  - This is because the game alternates between players, and since the difference starts even and each move reduces it by at least 1, the last player to make a move will be Bob.

- **Case when `abs(a - b)` is odd:**
  - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, the game will always end with Alice winning because the parity of the difference remains odd after each move.
  - Similar to the previous case, the game alternates between players, and since the difference starts odd and each move reduces it by at least 1, the last player to make a move will be Alice.

### Conclusion:

The logic implemented in the program is correct based on the given problem description and the detailed analysis above.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
