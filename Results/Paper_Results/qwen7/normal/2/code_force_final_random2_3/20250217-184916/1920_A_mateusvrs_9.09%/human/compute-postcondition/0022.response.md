Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`; `ax` is either 1000000007 or min(`x`, 1000000007); `bx` is max(`x`, -1); `a` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `-1`. Since `x` is an input integer, `bx` will take the value of `x` if `x` is greater than `-1`, otherwise, it remains `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
