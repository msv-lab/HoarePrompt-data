Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx >= ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values that were added during the loop's iterations, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration. If `bx >= ax`, then `r` is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, `tmp` will be equal to the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[ax, bx]`; `r` will have the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values where `a` was 2, `r` is a list with either the value 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `n` will be the total number of iterations performed, `a` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, and `x` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration. `ax` will be the smallest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 2, `bx` will be the largest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 1, and `cx` will be a set containing all integers provided as `x` when `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, `tmp` is 4, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `a` is the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `x` is the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `ax` is the smallest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 1, `cx` is an empty set, and `r` is a list with one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
