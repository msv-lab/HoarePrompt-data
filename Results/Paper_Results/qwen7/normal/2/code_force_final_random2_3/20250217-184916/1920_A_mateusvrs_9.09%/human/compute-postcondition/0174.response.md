Output State: `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values that were added during the loop's iterations, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration. If `bx >= ax`, then `r` is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, `tmp` will be equal to the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[ax, bx]`; `r` will have the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended to it.

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `t` represents the total number of iterations the loop ran, and `n` is the cumulative count of iterations. The set `cx` contains all unique `x` values that were added to it throughout the loop. `ax` holds the smallest value of `x` for which `a` was 2, and `bx` holds the largest value of `x` for which `a` was 1. The variables `a` and `x` represent the last inputs provided during the final iteration of the loop. Depending on the comparison between `ax` and `bx`, the list `r` will contain either 0 or the calculated difference minus the count of `x` values within the specified range.
