Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, after executing this line, `t` retains its value within this range. Similarly, `n` is an integer that will be read in the next line of code and will be between `2` and `100` (inclusive), but its value is not yet known. The constraints for `n` and the structure of the subsequent lines of code are preserved.
