Output State: **`bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values where `a` was 2, `r` is a list with either the value 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration.**

Explanation: The line `cx = set()` creates a new empty set and assigns it to the variable `cx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
