Output State: **`bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `x` respectively. Based on the conditions given:

- If `a` equals 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `-1`.
- If `a` equals 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
- Otherwise, `ax` remains unchanged.

Since the exact values of `a` and `x` are not specified, the output state reflects the general behavior described above. The preconditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
