Output State: **`bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values where `a` was 2, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration, with `tmp` being 0, and `bx` being less than `ax`.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = 0` initializes the variable `tmp` to 0. This does not affect the values of `bx`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `a`, or `x`. Therefore, the output state retains the same conditions as the initial state, with the addition of `tmp` being 0.
