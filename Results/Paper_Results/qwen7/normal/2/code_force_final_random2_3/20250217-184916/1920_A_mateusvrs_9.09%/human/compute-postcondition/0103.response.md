Postcondition: `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1, `i` is one of the elements in `cx`. If the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `tmp` remains unchanged.
