Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.**

Explanation: The code updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. Since `bx` was not defined before, it is assumed to be the default minimum value, which is typically considered to be negative infinity in such contexts. However, since `x` is an input integer, `bx` will now be the maximum of `x` and whatever the initial value of `bx` was (which is effectively `x` in this context). Therefore, `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and its previous value, which is effectively just `x` in the first run.
