Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`; `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007; `bx` is -1; `a` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. Since `ax` was initially either 1000000007 or `min(x, 1000000007)`, after the code runs, `ax` will be `min(x, ax)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
