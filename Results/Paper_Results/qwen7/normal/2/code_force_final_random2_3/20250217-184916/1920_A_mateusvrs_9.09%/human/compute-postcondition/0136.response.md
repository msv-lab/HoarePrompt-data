Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`**.

Explanation: The line `bx = max(x, bx)` updates `bx` to be the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`. The conditions and values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
