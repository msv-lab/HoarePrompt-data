You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. There are n lines describing the constraints, where each line contains two integers a and x such that a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        cx = set()
        
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        
        bx = -1
        
        for _ in range(n):
            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        
        if bx >= ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` will be the total number of iterations performed, `a` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, and `x` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration. `ax` will be the smallest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 2, `bx` will be the largest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 1, and `cx` will be a set containing all integers provided as `x` when `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` is a list containing the value 0. Otherwise, `tmp` will be 4, `n` will be the total number of iterations performed, `a` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `x` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `ax` will be the smallest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 2, `bx` will be the largest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 1, `cx` will be an empty set, and `r` will be a list with one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: [0] if bx >= ax, otherwise [ax - bx - 3]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of constraints where each constraint is defined by two integers a and x, with a being either 1, 2, or 3, and x ranging from 1 to 10^9. The function returns a result based on these constraints, ensuring that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and all constraints are unique.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
