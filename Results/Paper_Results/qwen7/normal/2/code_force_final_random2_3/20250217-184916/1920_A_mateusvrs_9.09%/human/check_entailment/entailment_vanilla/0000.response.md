Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store values that `k` must not be equal to.
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (1000000007) and `bx` to -1 to keep track of the upper and lower bounds of valid `k` values.
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Validity of Constraints:**
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it means there is no valid `k`, and it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Check

1. **Handling Constraints:**
   - The program correctly identifies the bounds `ax` and `bx` for valid `k` values.
   - It correctly handles the exclusion of specific values using the set `cx`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program ensures that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, as required by the problem statement.
   - It correctly handles the case where `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, indicating no valid `k`.

3. **Set Operations:**
   - The use of a set to store excluded values is appropriate and efficient for checking membership.

4. **Range Calculation:**
   - The calculation of the number of valid `k` values within the range `[bx, ax]` after excluding the values in `cx` is correct.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**
