Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `n` being undefined is replaced by `n` holding the integer value of the input provided by the user. All other variables remain in their initial state, which in this case means they are not defined or unchanged.
