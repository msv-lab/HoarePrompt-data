Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head uses `_` as the iterator variable and `range(n)` to determine the number of iterations. The variables involved in the loop head are `_` (which is just a placeholder) and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: The variable `n` represents the total number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0.

3. **Other variables in the state**: The other variables (`ax`, `cx`, `bx`, `r`, `a`, and `x`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute. They are part of the loop body and their values will be modified within the loop.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
