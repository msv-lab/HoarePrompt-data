Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes variables `t` to read the number of test cases, and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Constraints**: For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`, and then processes each constraint.
3. **Tracking Bounds and Exclusions**:
   - It uses `ax` to track the lower bound (inclusive) of valid values for `k`.
   - It uses `bx` to track the upper bound (inclusive) of valid values for `k`.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store the values of `x` that `k` must not be equal to.
4. **Updating Bounds and Exclusions**:
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to the maximum value between `x` and the current `bx`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to the minimum value between `x` and the current `ax`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.
5. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is still less than or equal to `ax`. If not, it means there is no valid `k`, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of excluded values from the total range `[bx, ax]`.
6. **Outputting Results**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Given the constraints and guarantees in the problem statement, this approach ensures that the program will correctly compute the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
