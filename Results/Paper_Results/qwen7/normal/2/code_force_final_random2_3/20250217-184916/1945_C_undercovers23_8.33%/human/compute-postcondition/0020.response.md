Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `zero` is 1, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'**

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which was 0 before the increment). After the increment, `zero` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
