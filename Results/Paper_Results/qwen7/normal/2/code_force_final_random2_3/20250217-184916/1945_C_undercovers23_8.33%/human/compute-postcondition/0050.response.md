Output State: **The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n-1`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, `zero` will be the total count of '0's in the list `sl`, `one` will be the total count of '1's in the list `sl`, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` will reflect the percentages of '0's and '1's respectively based on the final counts, and `lst` will contain all positions where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `n-1`, meaning it has checked each position in the string `s` up to the second last character. The variables `zero` and `one` will hold the total counts of '0's and '1's found in the string `s`. The variables `zero_perc` and `one_perc` will show the respective percentages of '0's and '1's calculated based on these counts. Lastly, the list `lst` will include all indices where both the percentage of '0's and '1's are at least 50, as determined during each iteration of the loop.
