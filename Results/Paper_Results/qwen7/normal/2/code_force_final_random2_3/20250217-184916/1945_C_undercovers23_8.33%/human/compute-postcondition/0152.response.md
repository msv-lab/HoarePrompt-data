Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is iterating over each element `elem` in the list `lst`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `lst`. After each iteration, `elem` takes the value of the current element being processed from the list `lst`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`.
   - `final` is a list containing the element `elem` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating through each element in `lst`, the next element `elem` will be the next item in the list.
   - The list `lst` itself does not change; it still contains all its elements.
   - The variable `mini` remains the same because it is based on the minimum difference found so far, which does not change until a new smaller difference is found.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `mini` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `final` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the element that matches the current `mini` has already been added to `final`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is:

State: **`mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, and `final` is a list containing the element `elem` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**
