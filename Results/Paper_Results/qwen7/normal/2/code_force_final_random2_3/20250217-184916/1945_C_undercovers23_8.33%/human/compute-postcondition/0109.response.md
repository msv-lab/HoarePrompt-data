Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `n` is at least 2; `zero` is 1; `one_perc` is the ceiling of `(o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)`**

Explanation:
- The initial state of `i` is either 0 or 1.
- The initial state of `n` is at least 2.
- If `i` is 0, then `zero` is 1.
- The variable `one_perc` is calculated using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Here, `o` and `one` are not defined in the initial state, so they remain undefined. However, the formula for `one_perc` is specified.

Since `i` is either 0 or 1, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `i` is 0, then `n - i - 1` is `n - 1`.
2. If `i` is 1, then `n - i - 1` is `n - 2`.

In both cases, `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of `(o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)`. Since `o` and `one` are not defined, we keep them as they are in the formula.
