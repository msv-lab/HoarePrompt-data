Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(pk - elem)` value, and `final` is sorted, `c1` is the same as the previous value, `n` is the input integer, and `t` is decreased by 1.**

This means that the variable `n` has been assigned the value of the input provided by the user, while `t` has been decremented by 1. All other variables (`mini`, `final`, `c1`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
