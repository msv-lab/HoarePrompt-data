Output State: `lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value (which will be the minimum absolute difference found during the loop) and `abs(pk - ele)` for each element `ele` in `lst`.

This means that after the loop has executed all iterations, `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference found between `pk` and any element in `lst`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
