Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `zero` is 1.
   - `one` is 0.
   - `zero_perc` is 100.
   - `one_perc` is 0.
   - Either `zero_percentage` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_percentage` is greater than or equal to 50, or there is no else part.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body and its value is not directly affected by the loop itself.
   - The values of `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` are not mentioned as being modified within the loop, so they remain the same.

5. **Ensure the loop condition is met**: For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be 2) must be less than `n - 1`. Given that `n` must be at least 1, let's assume the minimum value for `n` is 3 (since `i` will be 2 and `i < n - 1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0**
