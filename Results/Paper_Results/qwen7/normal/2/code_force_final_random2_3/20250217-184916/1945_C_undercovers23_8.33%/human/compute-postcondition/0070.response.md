Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` now contains the first element of `lst`, the third element of `lst`, and the third element of `lst`, and `elem` is the third element of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `elem` is already the third element of `lst`, appending `elem` to `final` means `final` now includes the first element, the third element (which is `elem`), and the third element again. The values of `mini` and `final` are updated accordingly, while `elem` remains the third element of `lst`.
