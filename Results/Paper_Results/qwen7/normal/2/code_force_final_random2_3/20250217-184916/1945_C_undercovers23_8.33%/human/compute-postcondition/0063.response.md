Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. `final` now contains the first element of `lst`, `elem` is the first element of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the first element of `lst` to the list `final`. Since `elem` was defined as the first element of `lst`, it remains unchanged. The value of `mini` is not affected by this operation.
