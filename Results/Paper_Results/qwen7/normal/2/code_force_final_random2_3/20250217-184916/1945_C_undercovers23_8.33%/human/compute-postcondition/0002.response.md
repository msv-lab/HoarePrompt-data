Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The precondition for `t` remains unchanged, meaning `t` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2⋅10^4.
