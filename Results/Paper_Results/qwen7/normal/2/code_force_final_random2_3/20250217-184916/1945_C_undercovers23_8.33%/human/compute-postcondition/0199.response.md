Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is `n // 2`, if `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is 1, otherwise `one` is 1; `zero_perc` is 50.0**

Explanation: The code calculates `zero_perc` which is the percentage of zeros in the first `i+1` elements of the string `s`. Given that `i` is 1, we check `s[1]`. Since the initial postcondition states that if `s[i]` is '0', then `zero` is 1, otherwise `one` is 1, we know that `s[1]` is either '0' or '1'. In either case, `zero` or `one` is 1. The calculation for `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Since `i` is 1 and `zero` is either 1 or 0, `zero * 100 / (i + 1)` simplifies to `zero * 100 / 2`. If `zero` is 1, then `zero * 100 / 2` is 50, and since `math.ceil(50)` is 50, `zero_perc` is 50.0. If `zero` is 0, then `zero * 100 / 2` is 0, and `math.ceil(0)` is 0, but since `one` is 1, the condition for `zero` being 0 does not affect the overall percentage calculation as it would be 0%. Therefore, the final `zero_perc` is 50.0.
