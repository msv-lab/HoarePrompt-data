Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is `n // 2`, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `s[i]` is '0', `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0, and `lst` contains `[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 0, `i + 1` equals 1. Therefore, `lst` now contains the element 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
