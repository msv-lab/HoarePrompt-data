Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is 100.**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 0, and since the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. The code calculates `zero_perc` as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Given `zero` is 1 and `i` is 0, `zero_perc` becomes `math.ceil(1 * 100 / (0 + 1))`, which is `math.ceil(100)`, resulting in `100`. All other variables remain unchanged.
