Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and the value of `t` is within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        pk = n // 2
    else:
        pk = n // 2
    sl = list(s)
    o = sl.count('1')
    z = sl.count('0')
    zero, one = 0, 0
    lst = []
    mini = pow(10, 8)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            zero += 1
        else:
            one += 1
        zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
        one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
        if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
            lst.append(i + 1)
    for ele in lst:
        mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
    final = []
    for elem in lst:
        if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
            final.append(elem)
    final.sort()
    if len(final) == 0:
        c1 = o * 100 // n
        if c1 >= 50:
            final.append(0)
        else:
            final.append(n)
    print(final[0])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(pk - elem)` value, and `final` is sorted. If `len(final) == 0`, then either `mini` contains the smallest value with `final` having one element which is 0 if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or `final` includes the element `n` and `c1` is less than 50.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, and `final` is either an empty list or a list containing 0 and sorted elements from `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`. Additionally, if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains those elements; otherwise, `final` now contains the integer `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `final` is a list. If the length of `final` is 0, then either `final` becomes an empty list with an additional element 0, or `final` remains as a list containing `n` and `c1` is less than 50, and `final` is sorted.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
