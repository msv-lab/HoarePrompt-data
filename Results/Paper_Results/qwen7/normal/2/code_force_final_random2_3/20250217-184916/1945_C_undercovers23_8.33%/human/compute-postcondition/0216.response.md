Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. Since `ele` is an element from the list `lst`, the exact value of `mini` depends on the current value of `mini` and the value of `pk - ele`. However, we know that `mini` will be set to the smaller of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The precondition that `lst` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
