Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. It returns the result based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. The function processes these parameters according to the given constraints and returns a result for each test case.
