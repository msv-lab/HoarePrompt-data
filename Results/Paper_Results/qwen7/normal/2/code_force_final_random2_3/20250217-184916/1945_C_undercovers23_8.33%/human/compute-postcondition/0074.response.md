Output State: `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(pk - elem)` value, and `elem` is the last element of `lst`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `mini` will still hold the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. The list `final` will contain every element from `lst` that has the smallest difference with `pk`. The variable `elem` will be set to the last element of `lst` after the loop completes.
