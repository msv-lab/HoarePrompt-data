Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(n//2 - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(n//2 - elem)` value, and `final` is sorted, `c1` is the same as the previous value, `n` is now `n // 2`, and `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `pk` is updated to `n // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. `mini` now reflects the smallest value among all `abs(n//2 - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, and `final` still contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(n//2 - elem)` value, and remains sorted. `c1` stays the same, `n` is now `n // 2`, and `t` is decreased by 1.
