Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `lst`. No changes are made to the values of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`). Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
