Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value (which will be the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` encountered during the loop) and `abs(pk - ele)` for each iteration; `final` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `final`. This operation does not affect the values of `lst` or `mini`. Therefore, `lst` still contains at least one element, and `mini` retains its updated value from the loop. The variable `final` is now an empty list.
