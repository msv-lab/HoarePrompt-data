Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 1, 2, or 3, `one` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `one_perc` is not mentioned as it was not directly calculated in the given code.**

Explanation: The code calculates `zero_perc` as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `i + 1` will be either 3 or 4. The value of `zero` remains unchanged, being either 1, 2, or 3. The value of `one` is increased by 1, but `one_perc` is not directly calculated in the given code snippet. The other variables remain unaffected.
