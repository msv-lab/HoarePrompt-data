Postcondition: `lst` must contain at least two elements, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` contains either the next element in the list `elem` (if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`) or the previous element in the list (if the absolute difference between `pk` and the previous element equals `mini`), and `final.append(elem)` has been executed if the condition is met.
