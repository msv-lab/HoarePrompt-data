Postcondition: `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(pk - elem)` value, and `elem` is the last element of `lst`; `final` is sorted. The length of `final` is 0, `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.
