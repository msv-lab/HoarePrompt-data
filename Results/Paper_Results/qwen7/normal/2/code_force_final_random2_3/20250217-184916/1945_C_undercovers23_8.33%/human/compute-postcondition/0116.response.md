Output State: **`i` is 1 (if it was 0) or 2 (if it was 1), `n` is at least 2, `zero` is 2, `one_perc` is the ceiling of \((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)\), and if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains `[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1. Initially, `zero` is 1, so after executing `zero += 1`, `zero` becomes 2. The values of `i`, `n`, `one_perc`, and the condition for `lst` remain unchanged from the initial state.
