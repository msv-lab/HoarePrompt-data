Output State: **`lst` must contain at least two elements, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` contains the next element in the list `elem`, and `final.append(elem)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. The values of `lst` and `mini` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this operation. `final` now includes the next element from the list `elem`.
