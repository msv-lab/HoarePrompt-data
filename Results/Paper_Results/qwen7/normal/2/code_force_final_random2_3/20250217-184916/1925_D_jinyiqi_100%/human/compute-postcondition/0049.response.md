Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 1`, `sum_f` is the sum of all input values of `f`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by the current value of `f`. Since `f` is an integer obtained from the input split along with `a`, `b`, the value of `sum_f` is now the sum of all the input values of `f`. The values of `cn2` and `j` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
