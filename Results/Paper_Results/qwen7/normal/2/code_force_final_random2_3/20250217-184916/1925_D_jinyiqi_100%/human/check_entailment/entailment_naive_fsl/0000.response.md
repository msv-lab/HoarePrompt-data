Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the friendship value of a chosen pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if the pair is friends.

The program calculates `p` and `q` based on the initial friendship values and the number of pairs, but it does not adjust these values according to the problem statement. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of choosing a friend pair and the increase in friendship value over k excursions.

A correct approach would involve calculating the expected value for each pair separately and then summing these expected values. This requires considering the probability of choosing each pair and how the friendship value changes over the excursions.
