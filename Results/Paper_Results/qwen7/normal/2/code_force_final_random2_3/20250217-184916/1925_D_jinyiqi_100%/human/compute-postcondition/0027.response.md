Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `j` is still 1 and `m` must still be at least 1. The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are the integers input by the user.
