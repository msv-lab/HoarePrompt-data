Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered for each iteration, `b` is the second integer entered for each iteration, `f` is the third integer entered for each iteration, `j` is the last value it took during the loop execution, which is `m-1`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd`, `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2`, `q` is now `q // gcd`**.

Explanation: The line `q = q // gcd` divides `q` by `gcd` and updates the value of `q`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
