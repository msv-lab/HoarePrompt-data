Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user, `gcd` remains the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `p` is updated to `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd`, `q` is updated to `2 * cn2` divided by `gcd`, `q` is now `q // gcd`, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered for each iteration, `b` is the second integer entered for each iteration, `f` is the third integer entered for each iteration, `j` is the last value it took during the loop execution, which is `m-1`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the user input. It does not affect the values of `gcd`, `t`, `i`, `p`, `q`, `sum_f`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `j`, or `cn2`. Instead, it updates `p` and `q` based on the given formulas using the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
