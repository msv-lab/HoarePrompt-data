Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered for each iteration, `b` is the second integer entered for each iteration, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`, `f` is the third integer entered for each iteration, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * cn2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` using the `math.gcd()` function. However, the GCD itself is not assigned to any variable in the given code snippet. Instead, it is computed and stored internally within the `math.gcd()` function. The values of `cn2`, `j`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `sum_f`, `f`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `gcd` variable now holds the GCD of `p` and `q`.
