Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is increased by `f`**.

The code `sum_f += f` increases the value of `sum_f` by the value of `f`. Since `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` now holds the sum of its previous value and `f`. The values of `j`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
