### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the program is correct based on the step-by-step analysis and verification with the provided examples. However, upon closer inspection, there are some issues with the formulas used to calculate `p` and `q`. Let's re-evaluate the logic and formulas:

1. **Total Number of Pairs (`cn2`):**
   - Correctly calculated as `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`.

2. **Summing Friendship Values (`sum_f`):**
   - Correctly summed the friendship values for all pairs.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The formula used to calculate `p` and `q` needs to be re-examined. The original formulas are:
     \[
     p = 2 \times k \times \text{cn2} \times \text{sum\_f} + m \times k \times (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \times (\text{cn2})^2
     \]
   - These formulas do not accurately reflect the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

4. **Correct Formula:**
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. For each pair, the probability of being chosen in any excursion is \(\frac{2}{\text{cn2}}\). Therefore, the expected value for each pair is:
     \[
     \text{expected\_value} = \text{sum\_f} \times \frac{2k}{\text{cn2}}
     \]
   - Summing this over all pairs gives the total expected value.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final result should be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} \text{f}_i \times \frac{2k}{\text{cn2}} \right) \bmod (10^9 + 7)
     \]

Given the above, the original program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation. The formulas used in the program are incorrect, leading to wrong results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement.

**Final: False**
