Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the variable `j` and the range `range(m)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `m`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user
   - `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`
   - `m` must be at least 1
   - `a` is the first integer entered
   - `b` is the second integer entered
   - `f` is the third integer entered
   - `j` is 1

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, `m` stays the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `f` is the third integer entered, `j` is 2**
