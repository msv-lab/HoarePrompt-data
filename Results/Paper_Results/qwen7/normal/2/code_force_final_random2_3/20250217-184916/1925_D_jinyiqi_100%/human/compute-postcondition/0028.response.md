Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `f`, `f` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by the value of `f`. Since `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` will now hold the value of `f`. The other variables (`j`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
