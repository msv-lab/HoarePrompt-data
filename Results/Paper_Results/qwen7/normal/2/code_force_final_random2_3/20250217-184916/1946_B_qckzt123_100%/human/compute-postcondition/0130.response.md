Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a constant, `t` is equal to `t % MOD`, `ans` is equal to `ans % MOD`**

Explanation: The code `ans %= MOD` updates `ans` to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`. Since `t` was already set to `t % MOD`, its value remains unchanged. The other variables (`i` and `k`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `ans` is now updated to its remainder when divided by `MOD`, while all other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
