Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 8 modulo MOD, `ans` is 8 modulo MOD**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `t`. Given that `t` is 8 modulo MOD, `ans` is updated to `ans + 8` modulo MOD, which results in `ans` being 8 modulo MOD. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged.
