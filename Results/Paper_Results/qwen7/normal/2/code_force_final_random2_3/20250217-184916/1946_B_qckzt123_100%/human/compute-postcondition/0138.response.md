Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k-1`.
- `t` will be equal to `2^(k-1) % MOD`.
- `ans` will be equal to the sum of `t` from `0` to `2^(k-1) - 1` modulo `MOD`.

Let's break down the value of `ans`:
- `t` starts at `1` (since `2^0 % MOD = 1`) and doubles in each iteration.
- After `k-1` iterations, `t` will be `2^(k-1) % MOD`.
- During each iteration, `ans` accumulates the value of `t` for each power of 2 from `0` to `k-2`.
- This means `ans` will be the sum of `2^0 % MOD + 2^1 % MOD + ... + 2^(k-2) % MOD`.
- The sum of powers of 2 from `0` to `k-2` is `2^(k-1) - 1`.
- Therefore, `ans` will be `(2^(k-1) - 1) % MOD`.

So, the print statement will output the value of `ans`, which is `(2^(k-1) - 1) % MOD`.

Output: **(2^(k-1) - 1) % MOD**
