Output State: `i` is 3, `t` is 16 modulo MOD, `ans` is 16 modulo MOD.

Explanation: The loop runs `k-1` times. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `k` must be 4. Therefore, the loop will run a total of 3 iterations. After each iteration, `t` is doubled modulo `MOD`, and `ans` is updated by adding the current value of `t` and taking modulo `MOD`. Starting with `t` as 2 (after the first iteration), we can calculate the values as follows:

- After 1st iteration: `t = 2`, `ans = 2`
- After 2nd iteration: `t = 4`, `ans = 2 + 4 - 2 = 4` (since `4 % MOD` is `4` and `ans` was `2`, so `ans = (2 + 4) % MOD = 6 % MOD = 4`)
- After 3rd iteration: `t = 8`, `ans = 4 + 8 - 4 = 8` (since `8 % MOD` is `8` and `ans` was `4`, so `ans = (4 + 8) % MOD = 12 % MOD = 8`)
- After 4th iteration: `t = 16`, `ans = 8 + 16 - 8 = 16` (since `16 % MOD` is `16` and `ans` was `8`, so `ans = (8 + 16) % MOD = 24 % MOD = 16`)

Thus, after all iterations, `i` will be 3, `t` will be 16 modulo `MOD`, and `ans` will be 16 modulo `MOD`.
