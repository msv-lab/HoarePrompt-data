Output State: **`i` is 6, `k` must be greater than 6, `t` is `t % MOD`, `ans` is `ans + t * 2 % MOD % MOD`**

Explanation: The line `ans %= MOD` means that `ans` is updated to its value modulo `MOD`. Since the initial state of `ans` is `ans + t * 2 % MOD`, after applying the modulo operation, `ans` becomes `(ans + t * 2) % MOD`. All other variables (`i`, `k`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
