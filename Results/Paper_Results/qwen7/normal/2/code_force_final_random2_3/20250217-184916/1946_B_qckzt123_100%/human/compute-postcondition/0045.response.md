Output State: `i` is 3, `t` is 16 modulo MOD, `ans` is 16 modulo MOD.

Explanation: The loop runs `k-1` times. Given the output state after the loop executes 3 times, we can infer that `k = 4`. Therefore, the loop will run 3 times in total. After the loop completes, `i` will be `k-1`, which is 3. The value of `t` doubles each iteration and is taken modulo `MOD`, so after 3 iterations, `t` will be \(2^3 = 8 \times 2 = 16\) modulo `MOD`. The value of `ans` is the sum of all `t` values calculated during the iterations, which is \(2 + 4 + 8 = 14\), and since we take modulo `MOD`, `ans` will be 16 modulo `MOD`.
