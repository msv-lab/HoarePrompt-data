Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the first element of the list `a`, `tmp` is 0 if the first element of `a` is less than 0, otherwise `tmp` remains the same as its initial value, `t` is the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `t = max(tmp, t)` updates the value of `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` and `t`. The value of `tmp` is determined by the initial condition: if the first element of `a` (which is `x`) is less than 0, then `tmp` is set to 0; otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged. The other variables (`a`, `x`) remain in their initial state.
