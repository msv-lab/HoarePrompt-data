Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the second element of the list `a`, `tmp` is the sum of `tmp` and `x`, `t` is the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`. If `tmp` is less than 0, then `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged, and `t` is still the maximum value between the original `tmp` and `t`.
