Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the first element of the list `a`, `tmp` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `tmp`. The initial values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. The initial value of `tmp` was less than 0, but now it is explicitly set to 0.
