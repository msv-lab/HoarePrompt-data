Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the third element of the list `a`, `tmp` is 0, and `t` is the maximum value between the original `t` and `x`.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = 0` sets the variable `tmp` to 0. This overwrites the previous value of `tmp`, which was the sum of the original `tmp` and `x`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is the third element of the list `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as well, since it was previously set to be the maximum value between the original `tmp` and `x`, and now `tmp` is 0, so `t` is still the maximum value between the original `t` and `x`.
