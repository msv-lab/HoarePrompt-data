Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer read from standard input and stripped of any trailing whitespace, and it is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive; `MOD` remains 1000000007.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    s = sum(a)
    t, tmp = 0, 0
    for x in a:
        tmp += x
        if tmp < 0:
            tmp = 0
        t = max(tmp, t)
    ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
    for i in range(k - 1):
        t *= 2
        t %= MOD
        ans += t
        ans %= MOD
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 3, `t` is 16 modulo MOD, `ans` is 16 modulo MOD.

Explanation: The loop runs `k-1` times. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `k` must be 4. Therefore, the loop will run a total of 3 iterations. After each iteration, `t` is doubled modulo `MOD`, and `ans` is updated by adding the current value of `t` and taking modulo `MOD`. Starting with `t` as 2 (after the first iteration), we can calculate the values as follows:

- After 1st iteration: `t = 2`, `ans = 2`
- After 2nd iteration: `t = 4`, `ans = 2 + 4 - 2 = 4` (since `4 % MOD` is `4` and `ans` was `2`, so `ans = (2 + 4) % MOD = 6 % MOD = 4`)
- After 3rd iteration: `t = 8`, `ans = 4 + 8 - 4 = 8` (since `8 % MOD` is `8` and `ans` was `4`, so `ans = (4 + 8) % MOD = 12 % MOD = 8`)
- After 4th iteration: `t = 16`, `ans = 8 + 16 - 8 = 16` (since `16 % MOD` is `16` and `ans` was `8`, so `ans = (8 + 16) % MOD = 24 % MOD = 16`)

Thus, after all iterations, `i` will be 3, `t` will be 16 modulo `MOD`, and `ans` will be 16 modulo `MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop ran, `t` is `t % MOD` and represents the highest value that `tmp` reached during any of the loop's iterations, `ans` is the cumulative sum of `t` values calculated throughout the loop iterations, modulo `MOD`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the final value of `k`, indicating the total number of iterations completed. The variable `t` will hold the value it had after the last iteration, which is `2^(k-1) % MOD`. The variable `ans` will contain the sum of all `t` values from each iteration, also taken modulo `MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k-1`, `t` will be equal to `2^(k-1) % MOD`, and `ans` will be equal to the sum of `t` from `0` to `2^(k-1) - 1` modulo `MOD`.

To understand this, let's break it down:
- The loop runs `k-1` times, so `i` will be `k-1` at the end.
- In each iteration, `t` is multiplied by 2 and then taken modulo `MOD`.
- Therefore, after `k-1` iterations, `t` will be `2^(k-1) % MOD`.
- Each iteration also increments `ans` by the current value of `t`, which is `2^i % MOD` for the `i`th iteration.
- So, `ans` will be the sum of `2^i % MOD` for `i` from `0` to `k-2`, which simplifies to `2^(k-1) - 1` modulo `MOD`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
