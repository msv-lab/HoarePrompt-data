Output State: `i` is equal to `k-1`, `t` is equal to `2^(k-1) % MOD`, and `ans` is equal to `(2^(k-1) - 1) % MOD`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be `k-1` because the loop runs `k-1` times. The variable `t` will hold the value `2^(k-1) % MOD` after the last iteration. The variable `ans` will contain the sum of `t` values from `0` to `2^(k-1) - 1` modulo `MOD`, which simplifies to `(2^(k-1) - 1) % MOD`.
