Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the last element of the list `a`, `tmp` is the maximum cumulative sum of `x` values without going below 0 during any iteration, and `t` is the maximum value between `tmp` and `t` after processing all elements in `a`. The variable `ans` is the cumulative sum of all `t` values calculated throughout the loop iterations, modulo `MOD`.**

This means that after the loop completes, `tmp` will hold the highest value of the running sum of elements in `a` without ever dipping below 0, and `t` will be updated to reflect the maximum value encountered during the loop. The variable `ans` will store the cumulative sum of these maximum values (`t`), taken modulo `MOD`.
