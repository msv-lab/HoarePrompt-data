Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` must be greater than 5, `t` is twice its original value**

Explanation: The variable `t` is multiplied by 2, but since the initial value of `t` was not specified, we only know that `t` is now twice its original value. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
