Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the second element of the list `a`, `tmp` is the sum of `tmp` and `x`, `t` is the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`**.

This means that the value of `tmp` has been updated by adding the second element of the list `a` (which is `x`) to its current value. The values of `a`, `x`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
