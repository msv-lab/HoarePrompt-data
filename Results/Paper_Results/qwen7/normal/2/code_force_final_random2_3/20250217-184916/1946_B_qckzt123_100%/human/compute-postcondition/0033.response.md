Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2 modulo MOD, `ans` is `t`, `i` must be less than `k - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `t`. Since `t` is 2 modulo MOD, `ans` takes the value of `t`. The other variables (`i` and `k`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
