Output State: **`i` is 5, `k` must be greater than 5, `t` is `t % MOD`, `ans` is `ans + t % MOD`**

Explanation: The line `ans %= MOD` updates `ans` to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `k`, or `t`. Therefore, the values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, `t` remains as `t % MOD`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + t % MOD`.
