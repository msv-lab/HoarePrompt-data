Output State: **`i` is 6, `k` must be greater than 6, `t` is `t % MOD`, `ans` is `ans + t * 2 % MOD`**

Explanation: The code `t %= MOD` updates `t` to be `t % MOD`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `k`, or `ans`. Therefore, `i` remains 6, `k` must still be greater than 6, and `ans` is updated to be `ans + t * 2 % MOD` with `t` now being `t % MOD`.
