Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a constant, `t` is equal to `t % MOD`, `ans` is `ans + t`**

The code `ans += t` increments the value of `ans` by `t`. Since `t` is already defined as `t % MOD`, the updated value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `t % MOD`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
