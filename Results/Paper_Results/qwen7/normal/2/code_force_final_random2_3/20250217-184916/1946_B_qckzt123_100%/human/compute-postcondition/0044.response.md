Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 8 modulo MOD, `ans` is 8 modulo MOD**

Explanation: The code `ans %= MOD` performs the modulus operation on `ans` and assigns the result back to `ans`. Given that `ans` was initially equal to `8 % MOD`, after executing the code, `ans` remains unchanged as `8 % MOD`. The values of `i` and `t` are not affected by this operation.
