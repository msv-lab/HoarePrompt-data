Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the second element of the list `a`, `tmp` is 0, `t` is the maximum value between the original `tmp` (which is now 0) and the original `t`.**

Explanation: The code sets `tmp` to 0, which updates the value of `tmp`. The values of `a`, `x`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
