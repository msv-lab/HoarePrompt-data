### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.
2. **Loop Over Test Cases**: The loop correctly iterates over each test case, extracting the necessary values (`n` and `s`) for processing.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function counts the number of 'U' (up-facing) coins in the string `s`.
   - If the count of up-facing coins (`num_up`) is odd, the function returns `'YES'`, indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count of up-facing coins is even, the function returns `'NO'`, indicating Bob wins.
4. **Game Logic**:
   - According to the problem statement, the game ends when there are no up-facing coins left. The key observation is that removing an up-facing coin and flipping its neighbors changes the parity of the number of up-facing coins. Therefore, if the initial number of up-facing coins is odd, Alice can always make moves that keep the number of up-facing coins odd until the end, ensuring she wins. Conversely, if the number of up-facing coins is even, Bob can always respond in such a way that keeps the number of up-facing coins even until the end, ensuring he wins.
5. **Output**: The function returns the correct result based on the initial number of up-facing coins.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins.

### Correctness:
**True**
