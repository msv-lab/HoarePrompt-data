Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the game as described. According to the problem description, the game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. However, the provided `func_1` function simply counts the number of 'U' characters in the string and returns 'YES' if the count is odd, and 'NO' if the count is even. This approach does not account for the actual game mechanics, such as the removal of the chosen coin and the flipping of adjacent coins.

For example, consider the input:

```
5
UUDUD
```

According to the problem description, the game would proceed as follows:

1. Alice chooses the first coin, making the string "DDUU".
2. Bob chooses the last coin, making the string "UDD".
3. Alice chooses the first coin, making the string "UU".
4. Bob chooses the first coin, making the string "U".
5. Alice chooses the only coin, making the string empty.

Since Bob cannot make a move after Alice's last move, Alice wins. However, the provided function would incorrectly return 'NO' because the number of 'U' characters (2) is even.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and is incorrect.
