The function accepts a string `s` consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters, representing coins facing up and down respectively. It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string. If the count of 'U' is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating that the string can be read from start to finish without ever having more 'D' than 'U'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating that such a condition cannot be met.
