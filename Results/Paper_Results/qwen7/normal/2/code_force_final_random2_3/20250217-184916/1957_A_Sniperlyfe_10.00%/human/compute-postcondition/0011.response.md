Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` where the first element is the number of sticks (n), followed by n integers representing the lengths of the sticks. It calculates the integer division of the frequency of each unique integer in the list by 4 and returns the sum of these results. After processing, the original list `arr` is emptied.**
