#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks (n), followed by n integers representing the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100, and 1 <= n <= 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The `arr` list is now empty, and for every integer `n` that was originally in `arr`, the value `freq[n]` represents the frequency of that integer in the original list `arr`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `arr` list will be empty because each element has been processed exactly once. The `freq` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the original `arr` list as a key, and the corresponding value will be the count of how many times that integer appeared in the original list.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4, where each frequency is the count of occurrences of a unique integer from the original `arr` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` where the first element is the number of sticks (n), followed by n integers representing the lengths of the sticks. It calculates the integer division of the frequency of each unique integer in the list by 4 and returns the sum of these results. After processing, the original list `arr` is emptied.
