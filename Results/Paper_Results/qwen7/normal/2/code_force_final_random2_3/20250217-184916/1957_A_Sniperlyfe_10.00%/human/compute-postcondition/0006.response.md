Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element (the list without the first two elements of the original `arr`), `n` is the third element of the original `arr`, `freq[n]` is the frequency of `n` in the `freq` dictionary which is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged except for the first two elements being removed. The variable `n` retains its value as the third element of the original `arr`. The dictionary `freq` now has the count of `n` incremented by 1.
