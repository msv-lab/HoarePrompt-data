You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks (n), followed by n integers representing the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100, and 1 <= n <= 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The `arr` list is now empty, and for every integer `n` that was originally in `arr`, the value `freq[n]` represents the frequency of that integer in the original list `arr`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `arr` list will be empty because each element has been processed exactly once. The `freq` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the original `arr` list as a key, and the corresponding value will be the count of how many times that integer appeared in the original list.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4, where each frequency is the count of occurrences of a unique integer from the original `arr` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` where the first element is the number of sticks (n), followed by n integers representing the lengths of the sticks. It calculates the integer division of the frequency of each unique integer in the list by 4 and returns the sum of these results. After processing, the original list `arr` is emptied.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine how many regular polygons (with equal sides) can be formed using the given sticks such that no stick is reused.
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - For each unique stick length, it calculates how many complete polygons (where each polygon has 4 sides) can be formed by performing integer division (`// 4`) on the frequency of that stick length.
   - It then sums up these values to get the total number of polygons that can be formed.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no sticks, the function will return 0.
   - If there are not enough sticks to form even one polygon (i.e., the minimum required sticks for any polygon is 4), the function will return 0.
4. **Input Handling**:
   - The main part of the code correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over each test case and calling `func_1` for each.
5. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which matches the problem's requirement.

Given this analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks.
