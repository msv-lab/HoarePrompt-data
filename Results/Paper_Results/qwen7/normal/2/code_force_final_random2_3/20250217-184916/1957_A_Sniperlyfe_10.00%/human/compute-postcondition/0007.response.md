Output State: The `arr` list is empty, `n` is not applicable since the list is empty, and `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer from the original `arr` list, where each integer's frequency is incremented by 1 for each occurrence in the list.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `arr` list will be empty because all elements have been processed. The `freq` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the original `arr` list as keys, with their respective frequencies as values.
