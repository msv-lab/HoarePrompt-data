You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list `arr` where the first element is the number of sticks (n), followed by n integers representing the lengths of the sticks. It calculates the integer division of the frequency of each unique integer in the list by 4 and returns the sum of these results. After processing, the original list `arr` is emptied.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine how many regular polygons (with equal sides) can be formed using the given sticks such that no stick is reused.
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - For each unique stick length, it calculates how many complete polygons (where each polygon has 4 sides) can be formed by performing integer division (`// 4`) on the frequency of that stick length.
   - It then sums up these values to get the total number of polygons that can be formed.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no sticks, the function will return 0.
   - If there are not enough sticks to form even one polygon (i.e., the minimum required sticks for any polygon is 4), the function will return 0.
4. **Input Handling**:
   - The main part of the code correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over each test case and calling `func_1` for each.
5. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which matches the problem's requirement.

Given this analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks.
