Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is the first input integer.
   - `k` is the second input integer.
   - `n` is equal to the integer input split from the first input.
   - `k` is equal to the integer input split from the second input.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - We need to evaluate the expression `n if n - k <= 1 else 1`.
   - This expression uses a conditional (ternary) operator. It checks if `n - k <= 1`.
     - If the condition `n - k <= 1` is true, it prints `n`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `1`.

4. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `n - k <= 1` is true, then `n` will be printed.
   - If `n - k > 1`, then `1` will be printed.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The exact value that will be printed depends on the values of `n` and `k`. Since the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can only describe the condition under which each value will be printed.

Given the conditions, the output will be either `n` or `1` based on the evaluation of `n - k <= 1`.

Output: **n if n - k <= 1 else 1**
