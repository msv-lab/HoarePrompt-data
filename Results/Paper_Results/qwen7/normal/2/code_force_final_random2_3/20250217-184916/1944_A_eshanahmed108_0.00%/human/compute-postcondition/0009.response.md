Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). For each test case, `n` is the integer input received on the first line of that test case, and `k` is the integer input received on the second line of that test case.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, we will have processed all the test cases specified by the value of `t`. For each test case, the values of `n` and `k` will be the inputs provided for that specific test case. The loop will print `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it will print `1`.
