Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since `t` was defined in the initial state and no operation changes its value, `t` remains a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. The values of `n` and `k` are set to the integers entered by the user.
