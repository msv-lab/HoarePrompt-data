Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). For each test case, `n` is the integer input received on the line where `n` and `k` are defined, and `k` is the integer input received on the same line as `n`. The loop processes each test case independently, so the final values of `n` and `k` will be the last set of inputs provided within the range of `t` test cases.

This means that the final values of `n` and `k` will be those obtained from the last test case processed by the loop, given the constraints on `t`, `n`, and `k`.
