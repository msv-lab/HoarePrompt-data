Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Logic Error**: The program checks if `n - k <= 1`. If this condition is true, it prints `n`, which is incorrect. It should print the minimum number of islands Everule can visit, not `n`.

2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - When `n - k == 1`, it means that after destroying `k` bridges, only one island remains reachable from island 1. This should result in printing `1`.
   - When `n - k > 1`, it means that more than one island remains reachable, so the answer should be `n - k + 1` (since island 1 is always reachable).

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n - k == 1:
            print(1)
        elif n - k > 1:
            print(n - k + 1)
        else:
            print(1)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all edge cases correctly and provides the right output based on the problem statement.
