Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time. It returns a specific output based on the given conditions.**

Note: The provided code snippet does not include parameters `t` and `s` within the function definition, but the problem description specifies that the function should process these values. Therefore, the functionality is described based on the inputs implied by the constraints and the expected processing.
