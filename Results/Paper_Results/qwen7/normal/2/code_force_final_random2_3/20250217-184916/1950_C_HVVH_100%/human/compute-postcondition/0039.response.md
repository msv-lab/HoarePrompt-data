Output State: **`day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 23 (with values greater than 12 adjusted to `h - 12`), and `m` is an input integer, `h` and `m` are updated to the values input by the user separated by a colon.**

Explanation: The code `h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))` takes an input from the user in the format of `hh:mm`, splits it by the colon, and converts both parts to integers. These values are then assigned to `h` and `m`. The values of `day`, `n`, and the original `h` (before adjustment) remain unchanged according to the initial state. The new values of `h` and `m` are derived from the user's input.
