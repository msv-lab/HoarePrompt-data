State: **`day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the variables and objects in the loop head: The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable and `range(n)` to determine the number of iterations. The only variable that affects the loop's execution is `n`.
2. Determine the condition for the loop to execute: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 (greater than 0).
3. Adjust the state: Since `day` is not directly related to the loop's execution, it remains unchanged. However, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 0 while keeping other variables as they are.
