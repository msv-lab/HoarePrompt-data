Based on the initial state provided:

- `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though `n` is not used in the print statement)
- `h` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 23, with values greater than 12 adjusted to `h - 12`
- `m` is an input integer
- If `h` is 0, `day` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` is set to 'PM'

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This statement will print the time in a 12-hour format followed by the `day`.

Let's break it down:

1. **Time Format**: 
   - `h` is adjusted if it is greater than 12. For example, if `h` is 15, it will be adjusted to 3.
   - `m` is always printed as a two-digit number, padded with a leading zero if necessary.

2. **Day Format**:
   - `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Given these points, the print statement will output the time in a 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM'.

For example, if `h` is 15 and `m` is 30, the output would be "03:30 PM".

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where {h} is the adjusted hour and {m} is the minute, and {day} is either 'AM' or 'PM')**
