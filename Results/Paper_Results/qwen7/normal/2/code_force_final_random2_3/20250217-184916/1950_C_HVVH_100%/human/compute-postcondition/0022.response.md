Based on the initial state provided:

- `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
- `n` must be greater than 0 (though `n` itself is not used in the print statement).
- `h` is either 12 or within the range of 1 to 23. If `h` is greater than 12, it is adjusted to `h - 12`.
- `m` is an input integer.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This will print a time in the format `HH:MM AM/PM`.

- `{h:02d}` formats `h` to a two-digit number, padding with a leading zero if necessary.
- `{m:02d}` formats `m` to a two-digit number, padding with a leading zero if necessary.
- `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

For example, if `h` is 15 and `m` is 30, and `day` is 'PM', the output would be `15:30 PM`.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}** (where `{h:02d}` is the two-digit representation of `h`, `{m:02d}` is the two-digit representation of `m`, and `{day}` is either 'AM' or 'PM')
