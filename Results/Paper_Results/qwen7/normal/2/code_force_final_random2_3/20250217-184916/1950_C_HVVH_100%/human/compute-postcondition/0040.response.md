Output State: **`day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code sets `h` to 12, overriding its previous value which was determined by the user's input. All other variables (`day`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
