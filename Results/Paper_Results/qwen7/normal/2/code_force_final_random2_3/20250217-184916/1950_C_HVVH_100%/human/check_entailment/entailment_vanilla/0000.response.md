Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`. This is correct because the 12-hour clock starts with `AM`.

2. **Reading Input**: The variable `n` is read as an integer, which represents the number of test cases. This is correct.

3. **Loop Through Test Cases**: A loop runs `n` times to process each test case. This is correct.

4. **Reading Time**: For each test case, the time in 24-hour format (`hh:mm`) is read using `input().split(':')`, which correctly splits the string into hours and minutes. This is correct.

5. **Converting Hours**:
   - If `h == 0`, it is converted to `12` and `day` is set to `'AM'`. This is correct.
   - If `h > 12`, it is converted to `h - 12` and `day` is set to `'PM'`. This is correct.
   - Otherwise, `day` is set to `'AM'`. However, this check is redundant because if `h` is between `1` and `11`, it should already be in the correct form without needing to explicitly set `day` to `'AM'`.

6. **Output**: The time is printed in the correct 12-hour format with leading zeros for both hours and minutes. This is correct.

### Analysis of Redundant Code:
- The line `if h == 12: day = 'PM'` is redundant because if `h` is 12, it should already be processed as `PM` when `h > 12` is checked. This can be removed without affecting the functionality.

### Correctness Check:
- The program handles all edge cases correctly (e.g., `00:00`, `12:00`, `23:59`).
- It correctly converts 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- It outputs the time in the required format.

Given that the program works as intended and handles all cases correctly, the program is indeed correct.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **True**
