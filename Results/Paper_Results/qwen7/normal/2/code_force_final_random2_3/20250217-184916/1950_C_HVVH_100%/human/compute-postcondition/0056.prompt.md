You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `day` will be either 'AM' or 'PM', depending on the final value of `h` as processed by the loop. The variable `n` will be set to 0 because the loop runs from `range(n)`, and once all iterations are completed, `n` will no longer be greater than 0. The variable `h` will be an integer within the range of 1 to 23, with values originally greater than 12 being adjusted to `h - 12`. The variable `m` will retain its original input integer value, as it is not modified by the loop.
    #
    #In summary, `n` will be 0, `day` will be either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the final value of `h`, `h` will be an integer between 1 and 23 (with values greater than 12 adjusted), and `m` will be the same as the initial input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time. It returns a specific output based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
