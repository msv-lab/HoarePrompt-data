Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `palka` contains at least one element.
   - `i` is the first element in `palka`.
   - `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`.
   - After executing the if-else block, the condition `i not in pl` no longer holds true as `i` is now added to `pl`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `palka` using `for i in palka`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is the first element in `palka` and it has been added to `pl`, the next element in `palka` (if it exists) will be the new `i` for the next iteration.
   - The dictionary `d` will remain unchanged unless the next element in `palka` is processed and added to `d` in the same manner.

4. **New State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `palka` will now contain all elements except the first one (since the first one has been processed and added to `pl`).
   - `i` will be the next element in `palka`.
   - `d` remains unchanged unless the next element in `palka` is processed.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated `palka` and the next `i`:

**State: **`palka` contains all elements except the first one, `i` is the next element in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`.**
