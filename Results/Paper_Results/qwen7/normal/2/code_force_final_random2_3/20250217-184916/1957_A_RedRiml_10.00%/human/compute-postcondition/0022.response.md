Output State: **`palka` contains all elements except the first one, `i` is the next element in `palka`, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Since `i` is the next element in `palka`, and `d[i]` was either set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, the only change is that `d[i]` is now incremented by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
