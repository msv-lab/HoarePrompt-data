Output State: **`d.get(i)` is incremented by 1, `palka` is not empty**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d.get(i)` by 1. Since `d.get(i)` is not None in the initial state, it means `d.get(i)` is a valid value (could be an integer, float, etc.). The operation does not affect `palka`, which remains non-empty as per the precondition.
