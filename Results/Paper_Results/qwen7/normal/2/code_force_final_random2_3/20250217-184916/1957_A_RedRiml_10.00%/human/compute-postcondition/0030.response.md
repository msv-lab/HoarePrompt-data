Output State: **`palka` contains all elements except the first two, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, or set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, and if `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` now contains the element `i`.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. If `i` was not previously in `d`, it sets `d[i]` to 1. Additionally, if `i` is not already in `pl`, it adds `i` to `pl`. The values of `palka` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
