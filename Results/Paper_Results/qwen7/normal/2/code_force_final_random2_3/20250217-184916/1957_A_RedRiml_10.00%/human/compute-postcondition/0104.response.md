Output State: `shapes` is increased by the number of times the condition `d[j] >= 3` is satisfied for each `j` in `pl`, and `pl` must still contain at least one element after all iterations.

In simpler terms, `shapes` will hold the total count of unique elements in `palka` that appear 3 or more times. The list `pl` will be empty or contain elements that have been processed, but it will not affect the final value of `shapes`.
