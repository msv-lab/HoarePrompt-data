Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in this case is `j`, and the loop iterates over the elements in `pl`. Therefore, the relevant variables are `j`, `pl`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that `shapes` is 1, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, and `pl` must have at least one element. Additionally, if the current value of `j` satisfies \(d[j] \geq 3\), then no changes are made to `shapes`, `palka`, or `d`.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `shapes` is 1 and no changes are made to it within the loop (as long as \(d[j] < 3\)), `shapes` remains 1.
   - `palka` is an empty list and no changes are made to it within the loop, so `palka` remains an empty list.
   - `d` is an empty dictionary and no changes are made to it within the loop, so `d` remains an empty dictionary.
   - `pl` must have at least one element, and since the loop continues as long as there are elements in `pl`, `pl` must still have at least one element.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - The only change needed is to increment `j` by 1 for the next iteration. However, since the exact value of `j` is not given, we can only say that `j` must be the next valid element in `pl`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`shapes` is 1, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` must have at least one element, and `j` must be the next valid element in `pl`**.
