State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `w` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `w`, which controls the number of iterations of the loop.
- For the loop to execute, `w` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
- The variable `t` is not directly involved in determining whether the loop should execute or not, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `w` is greater than 0, while keeping the value of `t` as given.
