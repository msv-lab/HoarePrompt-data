Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `pl`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `pl` and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Analyze the given postcondition**: 
   - `shapes` is increased by 1.
   - `pl` must still contain at least one element.
   - The current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `shapes` is increased by 1, it will be `shapes + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `pl` must still contain at least one element.
   - The value of `j` will change to the next element in `pl`, and the new value of `d[j]` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values of `shapes` and `j`, while ensuring `pl` still contains at least one element and the new `d[j]` meets the condition.

**State:**
- `shapes` is `shapes + 1`.
- `pl` must still contain at least one element.
- `j` will be the next element in `pl`.
- The new value of `d[j]` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, the final state is:
**`shapes` is `shapes + 1`, `pl` must still contain at least one element, `j` will be the next element in `pl`, and the new value of `d[j]` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
