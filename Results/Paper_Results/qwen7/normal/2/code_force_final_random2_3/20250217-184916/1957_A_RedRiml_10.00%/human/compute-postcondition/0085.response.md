Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the last element of `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the last element of `palka` appended with itself, `d[i]` is either `1` or incremented by `1` depending on whether `d[i]` was `None` or not.**

Explanation: The code appends the last element of `palka` (which is `i`) to the list `pl`. Therefore, `pl` now contains the last element of `palka` twice. Additionally, if `d[i]` was `None`, it is set to `1`; otherwise, it is incremented by `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
