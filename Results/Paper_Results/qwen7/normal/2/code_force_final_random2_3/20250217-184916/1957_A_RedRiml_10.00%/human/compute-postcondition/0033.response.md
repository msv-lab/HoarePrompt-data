Output State: **`palka` contains all elements except the first two, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d[i]` is set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, and `pl` now contains the element `i`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `i` is the next element in `palka`, and `d[i]` is updated based on whether `i` was already in `d`, the conditions for `d[i]` remain unchanged. Additionally, since `i` is not mentioned as being added to `palka` again, the precondition that `palka` contains all elements except the first two still holds. Therefore, the output state reflects these updates.
