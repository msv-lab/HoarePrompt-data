Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary containing each unique element from `palka` as keys with their respective counts as values, and `pl` is a list of all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered.**

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `palka` will be empty because every element has been processed.
- The dictionary `d` will contain each unique element from the original `palka` as a key, with the value being the count of how many times that element appeared in `palka`.
- The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka`, in the order they were first encountered, as each element was appended to `pl` only once when it was first seen.
