Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the list `pl`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `pl` contains at least one element.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `shapes` is `shapes + 1`.
   - `pl` must still contain at least one element.
   - The new value of `d[j]` must be greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `pl` containing at least one element, we need to ensure that `pl` still contains at least one element for the next iteration.
   - The variable `j` is incremented or modified within the loop body, but its exact value is not specified. We only know that `j` is an element of `pl`.
   - The value of `shapes` is not relevant to the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - The value of `d[j]` must remain greater than or equal to 3 for the next iteration.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `pl` must still contain at least one element.
   - `d[j]` must be greater than or equal to 3 (this condition remains unchanged).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`pl` must still contain at least one element, `d[j]` must be greater than or equal to 3**.
