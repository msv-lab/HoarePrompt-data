Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is a positive integer, `k` is `k + 1`. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is less than or equal to 0, else it is the ceiling value of `(x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15`. If either `x` or `y` is not greater than 0, then `x` remains as the first integer input from the user, and `y` remains as the second integer input from the user.
