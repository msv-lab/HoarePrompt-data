The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given inputs. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it updates `x` according to specific rules and then calculates and prints a sum involving `x` and `y`. If only `y` is greater than 0, it calculates and prints a value based on `y`. If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates and prints a value based on `x`. If neither `x` nor `y` is greater than 0, it prints 0.
