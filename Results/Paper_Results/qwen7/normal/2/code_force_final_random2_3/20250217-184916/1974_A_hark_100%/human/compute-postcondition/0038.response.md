Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is a positive integer, `k` is `k + 1`, `x` is the first integer input from the user, `y` is the second integer input from the user, `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`.**

Explanation: The code `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates the ceiling value of `y / 2` and assigns it to the variable `bxsfory`. The other variables (`t`, `ap`, `k`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged. The value of `bxsfory` depends on the value of `y`, which is an input from the user.
