Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is a positive integer, `k` is `k + 1`, `x` is the first integer input from the user, `y` is the second integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user and assigns them to variables `x` and `y`. It does not affect the values of `t`, `ap`, or `k`. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers entered by the user.
