Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly handles different scenarios based on the values of `x` and `y`:
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it updates `x` and calculates the number of screens needed using the formula involving `math.ceil`.
   - If only `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed directly based on `y`.
   - If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed directly based on `x`.
   - If neither `x` nor `y` is greater than 0, it prints 0, which is correct.
3. The logic in the program matches the problem statement and the provided examples. The calculations and conditions are implemented correctly to determine the minimum number of screens required.

Given that the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and the provided examples, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
