### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used anywhere in the main logic. This is indeed a leftover from a previous version of the code and should be removed.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - The main logic starts by reading the number of test cases (`ap`), which is correct.

3. **Reading Inputs**:
   - For each test case, the program reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. This is correct.

4. **Handling Different Cases**:
   - The program handles different cases based on the values of `x` and `y`:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed.
     - If only `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
     - If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0, which is correct.

5. **Calculating Screens Needed**:
   - For the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
     - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`, which represents the number of full 2x2 icons that can fit.
     - It adjusts `x` by subtracting the space taken by these 2x2 icons (each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, not 15 as mentioned in the original assessment).
     - It then calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by 15, which represents the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - Finally, it prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when only one type of icon is present or none at all.

### Verification Against Examples

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
   - One 2x2 icon and one 1x1 icon.
   - One 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, so we need 1 screen for the 2x2 icon and 1 screen for the 1x1 icon.
   - Output: `1`

2. **Test Case 2**: `7 2`
   - Seven 1x1 icons and two 2x2 icons.
   - Two 2x2 icons take 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.
   - We need 1 screen for the 2x2 icons and 1 screen for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - Output: `1`

3. **Test Case 3**: `12 4`
   - Twelve 1x1 icons and four 2x2 icons.
   - Four 2x2 icons take 16 cells, leaving 12 cells for 1x1 icons.
   - We need 2 screens for the 2x2 icons and 1 screen for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - Output: `2`

4. **Test Case 4**: `0 3`
   - Three 2x2 icons.
   - Three 2x2 icons take 12 cells, so we need 3 screens.
   - Output: `3`

5. **Test Case 5**: `1 0`
   - One 1x1 icon.
   - One 1x1 icon takes 1 cell, so we need 1 screen.
   - Output: `1`

6. **Test Case 6**: `8 1`
   - Eight 1x1 icons and one 2x2 icon.
   - One 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, leaving 8 cells for 1x1 icons.
   - We need 1 screen for the 2x2 icon and 1 screen for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - Output: `1`

7. **Test Case 7**: `0 0`
   - No icons.
   - Output: `0`

8. **Test Case 8**: `2 0`
   - Two 1x1 icons.
   - Two 1x1 icons take 2 cells, so we need 1 screen.
   - Output: `1`

9. **Test Case 9**: `15 0`
   - Fifteen 1x1 icons.
   - Fifteen 1x1 icons take 15 cells, so we need 1 screen.
   - Output: `1`

10. **Test Case 10**: `8 2`
    - Eight 1x1 icons and two 2x2 icons.
    - Two 2x2 icons take 8 cells, leaving 8 cells for 1x1 icons.
    - We need 1 screen for the 2x2 icons and 1 screen for the remaining 1x1 icons.
    - Output: `2`

11. **Test Case 11**: `0 9`
    - Nine 2x2 icons.
    - Nine 2x2 icons take 36 cells, so we need 3 screens.
    - Output: `3`

### Conclusion

Upon re-evaluation, the program does not correctly calculate the number of screens needed. The original assessment was incorrect because the calculation for `x` after placing the 2x2 icons is flawed. The correct calculation should account for the fact that each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, not 15.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
