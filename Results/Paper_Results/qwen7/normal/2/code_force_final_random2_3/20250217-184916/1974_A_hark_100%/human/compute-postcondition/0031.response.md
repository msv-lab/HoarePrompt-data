Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is a positive integer.
- `k` is `k + 1`, but this does not affect the print statement.
- `x` is the first integer input.
- `y` is the second integer input.

The print statement is `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the value of `x` and how it is processed in the expression `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

- `x` is an integer input.
- The expression `x / 15` performs integer division if `x` is an integer, resulting in a float.
- `math.ceil` rounds this float up to the nearest integer.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we cannot give a precise numerical answer. However, we can describe the output in terms of `x`.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where math.ceil(x / 15) is the ceiling of the division of x by 15)**
