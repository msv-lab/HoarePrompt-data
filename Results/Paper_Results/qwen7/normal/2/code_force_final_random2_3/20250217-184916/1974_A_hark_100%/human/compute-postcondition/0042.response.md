Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is a positive integer.
- `k` is `k + 1`, but since the value of `k` itself is not specified, it does not affect the print statement directly.
- `x` is the first integer input from the user.
- `y` is the second integer input from the user.

The print statement is `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`.

Since `y` is an integer input from the user, we need to consider the ceiling function applied to `y / 2`. The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer if `y / 2` is not already an integer.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling of half of the value of `y`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2)**
