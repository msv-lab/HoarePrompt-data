You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is a positive integer, and `k` is equal to `ap`. The values of `x` and `y` are the result of applying the operations within the loop for each iteration specified by `ap`. Specifically, for each iteration, if `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is less than or equal to 0, else `bxsfory1` is the ceiling value of `(x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15`. If either `x` or `y` is not greater than 0, `x` remains the first integer input from the user and `y` remains the second integer input from the user.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Calculation of `bxsfory`**: This variable is supposed to represent the number of full 2x2 grids needed for the 2x2 icons. However, the formula `math.ceil(y / 2)` is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that each 2x2 grid can hold 4 icons, but the remaining icons might still require additional space.

2. **Adjustment of `x`**: The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It incorrectly adjusts the number of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. The correct adjustment should consider that each 2x2 grid takes up 4 cells, so the remaining 1x1 icons should be adjusted accordingly.

3. **Calculation of `bxsfory1`**: The variable `bxsfory1` is supposed to represent the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. However, the calculation `math.ceil(x / 15)` is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that each screen can only hold up to 15 icons (5 rows * 3 columns).

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

- **Test Case**: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
- **Expected Output**: The minimum number of screens needed is 2. Here’s how it should be calculated:
  - Place 4 2x2 icons, which occupy 4 screens.
  - Remaining 1x1 icons: 12 - 4*4 = 4. These 4 icons can fit into 1 more screen.
  - Total screens needed: 2.

However, the program incorrectly calculates this as follows:
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2` (correct so far).
- `x = 12 - 2 * 15 + 4 * 4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2` (incorrect adjustment).
- `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) = 0` (incorrect).

Thus, the program outputs `2 + 0 = 2`, which is correct in this specific case, but the logic is flawed and may fail in other cases. For instance, if `x = 12` and `y = 5`, the program would incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not handle all potential cases correctly.
