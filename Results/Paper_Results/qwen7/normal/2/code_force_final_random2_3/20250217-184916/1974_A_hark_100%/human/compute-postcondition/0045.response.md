Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is a positive integer, `k` is `k + 1`, `x` is the first integer input from the user, `y` is the second integer input from the user.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since neither part modifies the values of `t`, `ap`, `k`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, the overall postcondition is simply the combination of the preconditions and the unchanged state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block.
