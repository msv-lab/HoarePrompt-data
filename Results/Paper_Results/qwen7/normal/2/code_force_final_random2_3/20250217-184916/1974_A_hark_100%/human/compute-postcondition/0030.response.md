Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is a positive integer.
- `k` is `k + 1`, but since `k` itself is not used in the print statement, this does not affect the output.
- `x` is the first integer input.
- `y` is the second integer input.

The print statement is `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`.

Here, `math.ceil(y / 2)` means taking the ceiling of the division of `y` by 2. The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer if the result is not already an integer.

Since `y` is an integer, `y / 2` could either be an integer or a float. If `y` is even, `y / 2` will be an integer. If `y` is odd, `y / 2` will be a float, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will round it up to the next integer.

Given that the exact value of `y` is not specified, the output will depend on the value of `y`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is the second integer input)**
