Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is a positive integer.
- `x` is an input integer, and it is explicitly stated that `x = 0`.
- `y` is an input integer, and it is explicitly stated that `y > 0`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Since `y` is an input integer and `y > 0`, `y` can be any positive integer.
2. The expression `y / 2` will result in a floating-point number representing half of `y`.
3. The `math.ceil` function will round this floating-point number up to the nearest integer.

For example, if `y = 3`, then `y / 2 = 1.5`, and `math.ceil(1.5) = 2`.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling value of `y / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is an input integer greater than 0)**
