Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is a positive integer, `k` is `k + 1`, `x` is either `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2` and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4 <= 0` else `math.ceil((x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15)`, or `x` remains the first integer input, depending on whether `x > 0` and `y > 0` is true or false. `y` remains the second integer input in both cases.**
