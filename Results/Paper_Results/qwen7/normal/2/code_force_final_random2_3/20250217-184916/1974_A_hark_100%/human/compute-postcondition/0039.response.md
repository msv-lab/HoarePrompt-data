Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is a positive integer, `k` is `k + 1`, `x` is `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is the second integer input from the user, `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` by subtracting `15 * bxsfory` and adding `4 * y`. The other variables (`t`, `ap`, `k`, `y`, and `bxsfory`) remain unchanged.
