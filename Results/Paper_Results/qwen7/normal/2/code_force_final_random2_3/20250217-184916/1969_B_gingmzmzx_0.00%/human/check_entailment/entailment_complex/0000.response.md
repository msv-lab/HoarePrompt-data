Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1()` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Cost**: The function calculates `ans` as the sum of the number of zeros in `s` plus the count of ones in `s` minus 1. This calculation does not account for the minimum cost required to sort the string using cyclic shifts of substrings. Instead, it seems to be calculating a different metric related to the counts of zeros and ones in the string.

2. **Misunderstanding of Cyclic Shifts**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts of substrings. The provided function does not implement any logic to find the minimum cost of such operations.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic inside the loop does not reflect the correct approach to solving the problem. It simply counts zeros and ones without considering the cost of cyclic shifts.

Given these points, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the provided function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
