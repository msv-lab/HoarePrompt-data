Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers with at least one element; `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1 if `c` is 0; `ans` is set to 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 and remains unchanged otherwise; if `c` is not 0, `ans` is incremented by the number of zeroes in `s` minus `cnt[0]`, and `c` is not equal to 0.
