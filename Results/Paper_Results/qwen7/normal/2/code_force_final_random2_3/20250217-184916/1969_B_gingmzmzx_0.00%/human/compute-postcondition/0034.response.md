Output State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt` is [0, 0], `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code sets `ans` to 0. The values of `cnt`, `zeroes`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that `ans` is explicitly set to 0.
