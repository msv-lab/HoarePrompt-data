Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will be the sum of the number of zeros in the list `s` plus the count of ones in `s` minus 1, `cnt` will contain the count of each integer in `s`, `zeroes` will be the initial number of zeros in `s`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, and `s` is a list of integers that has been fully processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All elements in `s` have been processed, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `c` in `s`; `ans` is the sum of 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 for each 0 in `s`, and `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each non-zero element in `s`; `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop; `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All characters in `s` have been processed; `cnt[c]` for each character `c` in `s` is the total count of that character in `s`; `ans` is the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each non-zero character plus the number of times `cnt[0] > 0` during the loop execution; `t` and `n` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
