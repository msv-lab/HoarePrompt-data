The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on the counts of zeros and ones in the string `s`. Specifically, `ans` is computed as the sum of the number of zeros in `s` plus the count of ones in `s` minus 1. The function prints `ans` for each test case and does not return any value.
