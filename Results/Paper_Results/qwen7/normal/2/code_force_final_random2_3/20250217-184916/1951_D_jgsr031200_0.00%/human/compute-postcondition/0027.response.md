Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `costs` is a list containing the element 1.
   - `h` is the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs` until `n` becomes less than `i`.
   - `n` is reduced to 0.
   - `h` is less than `k`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `costs = [1]`: This means the list contains only one element, which is 1.
   - `h` is calculated by iterating over each element in `costs` and performing the operation `n // i` until `n` is less than `i`. Since `n` is reduced to 0, this loop will run once with `i = 1` (the only element in `costs`). So, `h = n // 1 = 0 // 1 = 0`.
   - `n` starts at some initial value but is eventually reduced to 0.
   - `h` is less than `k`, but since `h` is 0, this condition is satisfied regardless of the value of `k`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given the above steps, the print statement will simply output the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
