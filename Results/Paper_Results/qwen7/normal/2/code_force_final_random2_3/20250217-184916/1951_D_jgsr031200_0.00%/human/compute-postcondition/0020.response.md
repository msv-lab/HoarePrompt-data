Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for i in costs`. This means the variable `i` is being iterated over the list `costs`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop**: 
   - `costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `h` is increased by `n // curr`.
   - `n` is decreased by `curr`.
   - `n` is further decreased by `i * curr`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in the list `costs`.
   - For each iteration, `i` takes the value of the current element in the list `costs`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is taken from the list `costs`, the first element of `costs` (which is `n - k + 1`) will be used in the first iteration.
   - After the first iteration, `n` will be updated as follows:
     - Initially, `n` is decreased by `curr`.
     - Then, `n` is further decreased by `i * curr`, where `i` is `n - k + 1`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `costs` will now be a list without the first element, i.e., `[1]`.
   - `h` remains unchanged since it was only incremented once.
   - `n` is updated as described above.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `costs` is now a list containing the single element `1`.
- `h` is unchanged.
- `n` is updated according to the first iteration's decrement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`costs` is a list containing the element `1`, `h` is increased by `n // curr`, `n` is updated by decreasing it by `curr` and then by `(n - k + 1) * curr`**.
