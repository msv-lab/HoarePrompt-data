Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in costs`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the list `costs`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `h` is increased by `n // i`.
   - `n` is decreased by `i * curr`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `costs`.
   - For each iteration, `i` takes the value of the current element in the list `costs`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `costs`, the variable `i` will take the next value from the list `costs`.
   - The list `costs` contains two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - After the first iteration, if `i` was `n - k + 1`, then `i` will be `1` in the next iteration.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `costs` remains the same as it is a list and its elements do not change within the loop.
   - `h` is increased by `n // i`, so in the next iteration, `h` will be increased by `n // 1` (which is `n`).
   - `n` is decreased by `i * curr`, so in the next iteration, `n` will be decreased by `1 * curr` (which is `curr`).

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `costs` remains the same: `costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `h` is increased by `n` (the value of `i` in the next iteration).
   - `n` is decreased by `curr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is increased by `n`, `n` is decreased by `curr`**
