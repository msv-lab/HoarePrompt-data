Output: **1**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and n is equal to k. The print statement simply outputs the integer 1, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`. Since `n` equals `k`, this condition is satisfied, and the print statement will output 1.
