Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The solution only handles the simplest case where `n == k` and prints `YES` with 1 stall and price 1. It also incorrectly handles the case where `n < k` by printing `NO`. However, the problem requires more complex handling to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Stall Prices**: The solution attempts to calculate the number of stalls and their prices but does not correctly simulate the process of Alice buying jewels from each stall. The logic inside `func_1` is flawed and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Incomplete Function**: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not handle all edge cases or provide a general solution to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to dynamically adjust the prices of the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Hereâ€™s a more correct approach:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Initialize the number of stalls and prices
    num_stalls = 0
    prices = []
    
    # Try to set up stalls
    for i in range(1, 61):
        price = 10**18 // (60 - i + 1)
        if n >= price:
            num_stalls += 1
            prices.append(price)
            n -= price
            if n < k:
                break
    
    # Check if we have exactly k jewels
    if sum(prices) == k:
        print("YES")
        print(num_stalls)
        print(" ".join(map(str, prices)))
    else:
        print("NO")
```

This solution tries to set up up to 60 stalls with decreasing prices, ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. If the sum of the jewels bought from these stalls equals `k`, it prints `YES` along with the number of stalls and their prices. Otherwise, it prints `NO`.
