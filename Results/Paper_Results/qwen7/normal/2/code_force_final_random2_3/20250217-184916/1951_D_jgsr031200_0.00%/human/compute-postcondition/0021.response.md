Output State: **`costs` is a list containing the element `1`, `h` is increased by `n // curr`, `n` is updated by decreasing it by `curr` and then by `(n - k + 1) * curr`, `curr` is updated to `n // i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to `n // i`. The values of `costs`, `h`, `n`, and `k` are not directly modified by this line of code, but their future states depend on the current values of these variables and the new value of `curr`.
