Output State: `costs` is a list containing the element 1, `h` is the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs` until `n` becomes less than `i`, `n` is reduced to 0.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `n` will eventually become less than the smallest value in `costs`, which is `1`. At this point, the loop terminates. The variable `h` accumulates the value of `n // i` for each iteration, where `i` is an element from `costs`. Since `costs` contains `n - k + 1` and `1`, the loop will continue to decrement `n` by `curr` (which is `n // i`) and add `curr` to `h` until `n` is less than `1`. At the end, `n` will be 0, and `h` will hold the total sum of `n // i` for all valid iterations.
