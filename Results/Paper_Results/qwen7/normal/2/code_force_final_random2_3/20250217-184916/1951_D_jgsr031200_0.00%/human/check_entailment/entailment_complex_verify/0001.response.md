### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. If possible, we need to output the number of stalls and their respective prices.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (Alice's coins) and `k` (desired number of jewels).
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not implemented correctly.
   - The provided implementation of `func_1` has logical errors and does not correctly solve the problem.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Base Case**: It checks if `n == k`. If true, it prints "YES", 1, and 1, which is a valid solution.
   - **Insufficient Coins**: If `n < k`, it prints "NO", which is also correct.
   - **Main Logic**: It initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Then it calculates how many jewels Alice can buy at these prices and updates `n` accordingly. However, this logic is flawed:
     - It incorrectly assumes that the first price is `n - k + 1` and the second is `1`.
     - It does not handle the scenario where more than two prices might be needed.
     - It does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - We need to create a series of stall prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - One way to achieve this is to use a decreasing sequence of prices starting from `n` down to `1`.

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code provides a detailed step-by-step breakdown of the program's state.
   - The initial assessment correctly identifies the flaws in the provided code.
   - The corrected code provided in the original assessment is logically sound and should work for the problem.

6. **Corrected Code Analysis**:
   - The corrected code initializes an empty list `prices` and sets the initial price to `n`.
   - It iterates up to 60 times, ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If the total number of jewels bought is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the list of prices.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the flaws in the provided code and proposed a corrected solution. The corrected code ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using a decreasing sequence of prices, which is a valid approach to solving the problem.

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
