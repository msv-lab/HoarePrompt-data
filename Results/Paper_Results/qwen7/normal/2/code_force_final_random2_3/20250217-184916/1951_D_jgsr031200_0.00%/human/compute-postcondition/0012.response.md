Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` which iterates over the elements of the `costs` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - `i` will take on the values from the `costs` list during each iteration.
   - The `costs` list contains two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in the `costs` list, meaning `i` will take on the values `n - k + 1` and `1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` will take on the values from the `costs` list, we need to ensure that the `costs` list is correctly initialized with the given elements.
   - We don't need to adjust the state of `h`, `n`, or `k` because they are not used directly in the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the `costs` list to ensure it contains the correct elements.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`**
