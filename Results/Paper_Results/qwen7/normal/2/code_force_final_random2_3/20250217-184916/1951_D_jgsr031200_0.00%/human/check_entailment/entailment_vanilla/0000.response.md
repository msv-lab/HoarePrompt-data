### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. If possible, we also need to output the number of stalls and their respective prices.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (Alice's coins) and `k` (desired number of jewels).
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not implemented correctly.
   - The provided implementation of `func_1` has logical errors and does not correctly solve the problem.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Base Case**: It checks if `n == k`. If true, it prints "YES", 1, and 1, which is a valid solution.
   - **Insufficient Coins**: If `n < k`, it prints "NO", which is also correct.
   - **Main Logic**: It initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Then it calculates how many jewels Alice can buy at these prices and updates `n` accordingly. However, this logic is flawed:
     - It incorrectly assumes that the first price is `n - k + 1` and the second is `1`.
     - It does not handle the scenario where more than two prices might be needed.
     - It does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - We need to create a series of stall prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - One way to achieve this is to use a decreasing sequence of prices starting from `n` down to `1`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n < k:
        print("NO")
        return
    prices = []
    current_price = n
    jewels_bought = 0
    for _ in range(60):
        if jewels_bought + (n // current_price) >= k:
            prices.append(current_price)
            jewels_bought += n // current_price
            n -= current_price * (n // current_price)
            break
        prices.append(current_price)
        jewels_bought += n // current_price
        n -= current_price * (n // current_price)
        current_price -= 1
    if jewels_bought < k:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(len(prices))
        print(" ".join(map(str, prices)))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)
```

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
