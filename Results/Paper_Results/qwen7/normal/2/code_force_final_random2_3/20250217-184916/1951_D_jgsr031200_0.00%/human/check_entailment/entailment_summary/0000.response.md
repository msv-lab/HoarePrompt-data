Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.
2. **Case 1: n == k**: The program correctly handles this case by printing 'YES' followed by 1 twice.
3. **Case 2: n < k**: The program correctly identifies this scenario and prints 'NO'.
4. **Case 3: n >= k**: 
   - The program attempts to calculate the sum of `n // i` for `i` in the list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - However, the logic for determining whether Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the sum of `n // i` for the given values of `i` will always result in Alice buying exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program prints 'YES' and 2 without checking if the calculated sum is at least `k`, and then prints the list `[1]`. This is incorrect because it does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
