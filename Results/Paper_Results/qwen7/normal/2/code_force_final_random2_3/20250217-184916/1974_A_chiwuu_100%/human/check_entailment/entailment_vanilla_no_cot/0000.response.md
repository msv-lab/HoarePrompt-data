Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Calculation of Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The logic to calculate `t` (number of screens needed for 2x2 icons) is flawed. It should consider that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5x3). 
   - The current logic calculates `t` as `b // 2` if `b` is even, and `t // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the total number of cells available on the screens.

2. **Calculation of Remaining Space and 1x1 Icons**:
   - After calculating `t`, the program attempts to determine how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`a`). However, the calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is incorrect. It should calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into that space.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final calculation for the number of screens needed is also incorrect. It should ensure that the remaining 1x1 icons are placed optimally across the screens.

### Correct Approach:
Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        total_cells = 5 * 3  # Each screen has 15 cells
        screens_needed = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons
        while b > 0:
            if total_cells >= 4:
                total_cells -= 4
                b -= 1
            else:
                screens_needed += 1
                total_cells = 15
        
        # Place 1x1 icons
        while a > 0:
            if total_cells >= 1:
                total_cells -= 1
                a -= 1
            else:
                screens_needed += 1
                total_cells = 15
        
        print(screens_needed)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that both 2x2 and 1x1 icons are placed optimally across the screens, ensuring the minimum number of screens is used.
