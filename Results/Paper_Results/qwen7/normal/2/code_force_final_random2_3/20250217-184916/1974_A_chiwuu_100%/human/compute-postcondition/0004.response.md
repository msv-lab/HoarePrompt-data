Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts the string `b` into an integer and assigns it back to `b`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `a`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `b` is a string from the second input split is now replaced with the fact that `b` is an integer resulting from converting the original string.
