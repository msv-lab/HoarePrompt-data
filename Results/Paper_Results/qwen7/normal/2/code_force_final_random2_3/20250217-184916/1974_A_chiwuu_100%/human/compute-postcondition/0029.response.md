Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer
   - `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `a` is an integer from the first input split
   - `b` is an integer from the second input split

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range of `n`.

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `n`, we need to update these variables.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - If `i` is 0, the next value of `i` would be 1.

5. **Updating the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is an integer, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split**
