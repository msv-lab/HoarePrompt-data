Output State: **`t` is 1; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `a` is an integer from the first input split; `b` is an integer from the second input split.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is explicitly set to 1, so `t` remains 1. The value of `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which simplifies to `1 * 15 - b * 4` or `15 - 4 * b`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.
