Output State: **`t` is an integer, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is the second word from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(a)` converts the string `a` into an integer. The value of `t`, `t1`, `n`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `a` is now an integer.
