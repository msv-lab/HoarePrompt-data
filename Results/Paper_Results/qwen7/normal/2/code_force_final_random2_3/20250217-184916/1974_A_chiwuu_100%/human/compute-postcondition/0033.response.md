Output State: **`t` is `b`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input.**

Explanation: The code `t = b` assigns the value of `b` to `t`. The values of `t1`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and the conversion of `b` from the second word of the input remain unchanged.
