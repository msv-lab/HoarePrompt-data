Output State: **`t` is `b`, `t1` is `b * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the input `a`, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input.**

Explanation: The code `t = b` assigns the value of `b` to `t`. The other variables (`t1`, `n`, `i`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` is updated to `b`, while `t1` is still calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which simplifies to `b * 15 - b * 4`. The conditions and values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were initially.
