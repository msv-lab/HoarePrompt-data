### Reasoning:

Let's re-examine the problem and the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to place icons on a 5x3 grid (15 cells per screen).
- Icons can be either 1x1 or 2x2.
- We need to minimize the number of screens used.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: `n` is the number of test cases.
2. **Loop through each test case**: For each test case, read `a` and `b`.
3. **Calculate `t`**: `t` is initially set to `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `b` is even, `t = b // 2`.
   - If `b` is odd, `t = b // 2 + 1`.
4. **Calculate `t1`**: `t1` is the remaining space after placing `t` 2x2 icons.
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
5. **Check if remaining space can fit 1x1 icons**: If `t1 >= a`, no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, calculate the number of additional screens needed.
6. **Print the result**.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit**: `b // 2` (since each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells).
2. **Calculate the remaining space**: `15 * (b // 2) - b * 4`.
3. **Determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space**: Check if the remaining space is enough to fit the 1x1 icons.
4. **Calculate additional screens needed**: If not, calculate the number of additional screens needed.

#### Example Analysis:
- **Case `1 1`**:
  - `b = 1` (one 2x2 icon).
  - `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1` (since 1 is odd).
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`.
  - `t1 >= 1` (true), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1`.

This matches the expected output, indicating the program works correctly for this case.

- **Case `7 2`**:
  - `b = 2` (two 2x2 icons).
  - `t = 2 // 2 = 1` (since 2 is even).
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`.
  - `t1 >= 7` (false), so we need additional screens.
  - Remaining space: `7 - 7 = 0`, so no additional 1x1 icons fit.
  - Additional screens needed: `1` (since 1 1x1 icon remains).
  - Output: `2`.

This also matches the expected output.

- **Case `12 4`**:
  - `b = 4` (four 2x2 icons).
  - `t = 4 // 2 = 2`.
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`.
  - `t1 >= 12` (true), so no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `2`.

This matches the expected output.

Based on the analysis, the program seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the given test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons, and the provided examples match the expected outputs.
