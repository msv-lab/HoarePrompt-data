The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. All other variables remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 1, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split, and the current value of `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`.
