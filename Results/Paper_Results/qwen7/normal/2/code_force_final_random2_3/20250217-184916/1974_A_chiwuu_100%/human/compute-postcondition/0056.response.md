Output State: **`t` is either `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1`, `t1` is `15 * (b / 2) - b * 4` or `15 * (b // 2 + 1) - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the input `a`, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input, `t` is unchanged.**

The code `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. All other variables remain in their initial states as no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet.
