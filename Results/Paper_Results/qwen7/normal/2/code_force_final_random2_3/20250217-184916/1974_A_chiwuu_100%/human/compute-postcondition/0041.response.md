Output State: **`t` is `b // 2 + (a - b * 4) // 15 + 2`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input, `t2` is `a - t1`**.

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. Given that `t2` is defined as `a - t1`, and `t1` is defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`, we substitute these into the equation for `t`. Thus, `t` becomes `b // 2 + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`. Since `t` was initially either `b // 2` or `b // 2 + 1`, the updated value of `t` simplifies to `b // 2 + (a - b * 4) // 15 + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
