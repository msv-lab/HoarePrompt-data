Postcondition: `t` is an integer, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split, `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t` is set to `1 + (t2 // 15)`. Otherwise, `t` is set to `1 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.
