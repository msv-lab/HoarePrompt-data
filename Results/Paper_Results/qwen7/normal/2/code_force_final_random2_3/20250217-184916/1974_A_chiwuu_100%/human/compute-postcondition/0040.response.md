Output State: **`t` is `b // 2 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input, `t2` is `a - t1`**.

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Since `t2` is defined as `a - t1` and `t1` is defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`, we substitute these into the equation for `t`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
