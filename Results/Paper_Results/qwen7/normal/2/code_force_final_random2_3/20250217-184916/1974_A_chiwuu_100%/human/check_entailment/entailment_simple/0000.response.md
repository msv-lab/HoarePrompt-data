Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually. This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads two integers `a` and `b` for each test case, where `a` represents the number of 1x1 icons and `b` represents the number of 2x2 icons.
   - It initializes `t` to `b`. This variable is intended to represent the number of 2x2 icons, which each occupy 4 cells.
   - It adjusts `t` based on whether `b` is even or odd:
     - If `b` is even, `t` remains `b // 2`.
     - If `b` is odd, `t` becomes `(b // 2) + 1`.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space**:
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This calculation seems to be intended to determine the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons, but there are issues with this approach.
   - The condition `if t1 >= a:` checks if the remaining space is sufficient to fit all 1x1 icons. If not, it proceeds to calculate additional screens needed.

4. **Adjusting for Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - If `t1 < a`, it calculates `t2` as `a - t1` and then adjusts `t` based on how many full 15-cell blocks (`15 // 1 = 15` cells per screen) are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons, plus any additional screen if there is a remainder.

5. **Outputting Result**:
   - Finally, it prints the value of `t`, which is supposed to represent the minimum number of screens needed.

### Issues Identified:
- The calculation of `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4` does not accurately represent the remaining space available for 1x1 icons. Instead, it should consider the total number of cells available on the screens and subtract the cells already occupied by 2x2 icons.
- The logic for determining the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that each additional screen can hold 15 cells, which is not necessarily true since the remaining space could be less than 15 cells.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of cells available on the screens.
2. Determine how many 2x2 icons can fit into these cells.
3. Calculate the remaining space and determine how many additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of screens needed.

Correctness: **False**
