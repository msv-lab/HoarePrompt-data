Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is a string from the second input split**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(a)` converts the string `a` into an integer and assigns it back to `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `b`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `a` is a string from the first input split is maintained, but now `a` holds its integer value.
