Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `t` is initialized to `b`, which represents the number of 2x2 icons.
   - If `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2. Otherwise, `t` is divided by 2 and incremented by 1. This calculation seems to be intended to determine the number of full 2x2 grids needed.

3. **Calculation of Remaining Space:**
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This seems to be an attempt to calculate the remaining space after placing `b` 2x2 icons on the screens. However, this calculation does not seem to align with the actual grid capacity since a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells.

4. **Remaining Icons Calculation:**
   - `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, where `a` is the number of 1x1 icons. This calculation seems to be an attempt to determine how many 1x1 icons remain after accounting for the space taken by 2x2 icons.

5. **Final Screen Count Calculation:**
   - The program checks if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`. If true, it implies that all 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space without needing additional screens.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. This part seems to have a mistake because it incorrectly assumes that each remaining 1x1 icon requires a full 15-cell space, which is not accurate.

6. **Output:**
   - The final result `t` is printed, which is supposed to be the minimum number of screens needed.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Space:**
   - The formula `t * 15 - b * 4` does not accurately reflect the remaining space available on the screens. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, but the remaining space should be calculated considering the actual layout constraints.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - The logic for calculating additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is flawed. It incorrectly assumes each 1x1 icon needs a full 15-cell space.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
