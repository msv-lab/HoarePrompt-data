Output State: **`t` is either `b // 2` or `b // 2 + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input, `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a - t1` to `t2`. Since `t1` is already defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is simply the subtraction of `t1` from `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
