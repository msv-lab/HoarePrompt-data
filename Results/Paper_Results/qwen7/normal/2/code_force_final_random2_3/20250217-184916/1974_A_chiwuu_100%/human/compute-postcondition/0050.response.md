Output State: **`t` is either `b // 2` or `b // 2 + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the input `a`, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input, `b` is now its integer value.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(b)` converts the string value of `b` into an integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
