### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified two main issues with the provided program:
1. The `defaultdict` initialization uses an undefined `default_value`.
2. The logic to calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed is incorrect.

The provided corrected program addresses both issues:
1. It initializes the `defaultdict` with `int` as the default value, which resolves the NameError.
2. It correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed by ensuring each difficulty level appears at least once per round.

Given the corrected program, the original assessment's conclusion that the program is incorrect is accurate. However, the provided corrected program fixes the issues and now meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The corrected program is now correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
