### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to ensure that for each of the `m` rounds, there is at least one problem of each difficulty level ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G').
- The program should calculate the minimum number of additional problems required to meet this requirement.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It also reads a string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Problems:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level.
   - It initializes the counts for all difficulty levels to 0 and updates them based on the input string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - The program iterates over the keys of the dictionary and calculates the additional problems needed for each difficulty level.
   - It sums up these additional problems to get the total number of problems that need to be added.

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1()` always returns 0, which is irrelevant to the main logic of the program.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program does not correctly handle the requirement that each difficulty level must appear at least `m` times across all rounds.
- The current logic only checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and adds the difference to the answer. This is insufficient because it does not ensure that the total count of problems for each difficulty level is sufficient for `m` rounds.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
10 2
BGECDCBDED
```
- The bank has 10 problems: B, G, E, C, D, C, B, D, E, D.
- To hold 2 rounds, we need at least 2 problems of each difficulty level ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G').

The program will output `2` because it only checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and adds the difference. However, the correct answer should be `4` because:
- We need at least 2 'A', 2 'B', 2 'C', 2 'D', 2 'E', 2 'F', and 2 'G'.
- The bank currently has 1 'A', 2 'B', 2 'C', 3 'D', 1 'E', and 0 'F' and 0 'G'.
- Therefore, we need 1 more 'A', 0 more 'B', 0 more 'C', 0 more 'D', 1 more 'E', 2 more 'F', and 2 more 'G'.
- Summing these up gives us `1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6`, but since we only need 2 rounds, the correct answer is `4`.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not ensure that the total count of problems for each difficulty level is sufficient for `m` rounds.
