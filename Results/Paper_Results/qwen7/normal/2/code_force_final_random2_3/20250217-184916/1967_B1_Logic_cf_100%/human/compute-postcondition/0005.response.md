Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `b` is defined in the loop head.
   - The loop runs from `2` to `min(n, m) + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `b`:**
   - Since the loop starts at `2`, the initial value of `b` should be `2`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.
   - Therefore, `b` must be within the range `[2, min(n, m) + 1)`.

4. **Adjust the States of the Variables:**
   - `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition and can remain as `t > 0`.
   - `n` and `m` are the integer values of the first and second elements in the original list, respectively, and they must satisfy the condition that `b` is within the range `[2, min(n, m) + 1)`.
   - `ans` is initially set to `n`, but this does not affect the loop condition directly.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `b` should be `2`.
- `n` and `m` must be such that `min(n, m) >= 2` (since `b` starts from `2` and goes up to `min(n, m) + 1`).

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`t` is greater than 0, `b` is 2, `n` and `m` must be such that `min(n, m) >= 2`**.
