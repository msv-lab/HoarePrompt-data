Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `b` is greater than or equal to `min(n, m) + 1`.
- `ans` is the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for all `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m)` inclusive.
- `n` and `m` must be such that `min(n, m) >= 2`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the calculation of `ans`:

1. **Range of `b`:** Since `b` starts from 2 and goes up to `min(n, m)`, and `min(n, m) >= 2`, the range of `b` will be from 2 to `min(n, m)` inclusive.
2. **Calculation of each term:** For each `b` in this range, the term \((n + b) // (b * b)\) is computed. Here, `//` denotes integer division.
3. **Summing up the terms:** The value of `ans` is the sum of all these terms.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not specified, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the formula and the range of `b`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for all `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m)` inclusive.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of (n + b) // (b * b) for all b in the range from 2 to min(n, m) inclusive)**
