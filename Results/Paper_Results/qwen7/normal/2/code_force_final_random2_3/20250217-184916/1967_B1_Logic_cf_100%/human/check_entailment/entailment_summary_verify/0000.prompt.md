You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). It calculates the value of \( ans \) by initializing it to \( n \) and then adding to it the result of \( (n + b) // (b * b) \) for each integer \( b \) from 2 up to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \). After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of \( ans \) for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates `ans` as `n` and then adds a value based on a loop that does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement. 

To illustrate, let's consider a specific case: `n = 10` and `m = 10`.

According to the problem, we need to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Let's manually check a few pairs for `n = 10` and `m = 10`:

- For `(1, 1)`: `1 + 1 = 2`, and `2` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(1, 1) = 1`. This pair is valid.
- For `(2, 1)`: `2 + 1 = 3`, and `3` is not a multiple of `1 * gcd(2, 1) = 1`. This pair is invalid.
- For `(2, 2)`: `2 + 2 = 4`, and `4` is a multiple of `2 * gcd(2, 2) = 2`. This pair is valid.
- For `(3, 1)`: `3 + 1 = 4`, and `4` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(3, 1) = 1`. This pair is valid.
- For `(4, 1)`: `4 + 1 = 5`, and `5` is not a multiple of `1 * gcd(4, 1) = 1`. This pair is invalid.
- For `(5, 1)`: `5 + 1 = 6`, and `6` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(5, 1) = 1`. This pair is valid.
- For `(6, 1)`: `6 + 1 = 7`, and `7` is not a multiple of `1 * gcd(6, 1) = 1`. This pair is invalid.
- For `(6, 2)`: `6 + 2 = 8`, and `8` is a multiple of `2 * gcd(6, 2) = 2`. This pair is valid.
- For `(6, 3)`: `6 + 3 = 9`, and `9` is a multiple of `3 * gcd(6, 3) = 3`. This pair is valid.
- For `(7, 1)`: `7 + 1 = 8`, and `8` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(7, 1) = 1`. This pair is valid.
- For `(8, 1)`: `8 + 1 = 9`, and `9` is not a multiple of `1 * gcd(8, 1) = 1`. This pair is invalid.
- For `(9, 1)`: `9 + 1 = 10`, and `10` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(9, 1) = 1`. This pair is valid.
- For `(10, 1)`: `10 + 1 = 11`, and `11` is not a multiple of `1 * gcd(10, 1) = 1`. This pair is invalid.

From this manual check, we can see that the program does not correctly count the valid pairs. For instance, the program incorrectly counts `(2, 1)` as valid, which it is not according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
