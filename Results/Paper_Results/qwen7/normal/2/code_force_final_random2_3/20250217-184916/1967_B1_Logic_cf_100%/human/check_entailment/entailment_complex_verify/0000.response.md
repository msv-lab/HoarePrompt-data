### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements and the example provided.

#### Problem Requirements:
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read as strings, split, and converted to integers.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop iterates from `b = 2` to `min(n, m)`.
   - In each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\).

3. **Calculation**:
   - The expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not match the problem requirement. Specifically, it should be checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider the example provided: \(n = 10\) and \(m = 10\).

- **Manual Calculation**:
  - For \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\), and \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). Valid.
  - For \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\), and \(3\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). Invalid.
  - For \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\), and \(4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\). Valid.
  - For \((3, 1)\): \(3 + 1 = 4\), and \(4\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1) = 1\). Valid.
  - For \((4, 1)\): \(4 + 1 = 5\), and \(5\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(4, 1) = 1\). Invalid.
  - For \((5, 1)\): \(5 + 1 = 6\), and \(6\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(5, 1) = 1\). Valid.
  - For \((6, 1)\): \(6 + 1 = 7\), and \(7\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(6, 1) = 1\). Invalid.
  - For \((6, 2)\): \(6 + 2 = 8\), and \(8\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(6, 2) = 2\). Valid.
  - For \((6, 3)\): \(6 + 3 = 9\), and \(9\) is a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(6, 3) = 3\). Valid.
  - For \((7, 1)\): \(7 + 1 = 8\), and \(8\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(7, 1) = 1\). Valid.
  - For \((8, 1)\): \(8 + 1 = 9\), and \(9\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(8, 1) = 1\). Invalid.
  - For \((9, 1)\): \(9 + 1 = 10\), and \(10\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(9, 1) = 1\). Valid.
  - For \((10, 1)\): \(10 + 1 = 11\), and \(11\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(10, 1) = 1\). Invalid.

- **Expected Output**: The expected output for \(n = 10\) and \(m = 10\) is 14, but the program outputs 101.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
