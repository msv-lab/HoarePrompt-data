Output State: **`ans` is equal to `ans` + (n + 3) // (3 * 3), `b` is 3**.

Explanation: The initial state of `ans` is `ans + (n + 2) // (2 * 2)`. After executing the code snippet, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`, which simplifies to `ans + (n + 3) // (3 * 3)`. The value of `b` remains unchanged at 3.
