Output State: **`ans` is increased by the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each value of `b` from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\), `b` is \(\min(n, m) + 2\), and `[n, m]` is updated to the list of integer values of the split input strings.**

Explanation: The code reads two space-separated strings from input and splits them into a list `[n, m]`. This updates the value of `[n, m]` to the list of integer values of the split strings. However, the value of `ans` remains unchanged because no operation is performed on `ans` within the given code snippet. The variable `b` is set to `\(\min(n, m) + 2\)` but no calculation involving `ans` is performed using `b`. Therefore, the initial state of `ans` is preserved.
