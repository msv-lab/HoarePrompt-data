Output State: **`T` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `b` is greater than or equal to `min(int(n), int(m)) + 1`, `[n, m]` is a list containing the integer values of the split input strings, `ans` is `n`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
