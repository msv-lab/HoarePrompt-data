Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m. The function verifies that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, with the total sum of n or m across all test cases not exceeding 2 ⋅ 10^6.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers n and m, ensuring they meet specified constraints.
