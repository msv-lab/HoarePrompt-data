Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):
    [n, m] = input().split()
    [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
    ans = n
    for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
        ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `b` is greater than or equal to `min(n, m) + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m)` inclusive, and `n` and `m` must be such that `min(n, m) >= 2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains greater than 0, `b` will be one more than the maximum value it reached during the loop (which is `min(n, m)`), `ans` will be the cumulative sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` starting from 2 up to `min(n, m)`, and `n` and `m` must ensure that their minimum value is at least 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `ans` is increased by the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each value of `b` from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\), `b` is \(\min(n, m) + 1\), and `[n, m]` is a list containing the integer values of the split input strings.

In simpler terms, `ans` will be the original value of `n` plus the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for every integer `b` starting from 2 up to the smaller of `n` and `m` inclusive. The variable `b` will take on the final value of \(\min(n, m) + 1\) after the loop completes all its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `ans` is equal to the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, inclusive, and `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of expressions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for every `b` starting from 2 up to the minimum value between `n` and `m`, including `min(n, m)`. The variable `b` will be set to one value beyond the last iteration, which is `min(n, m) + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
