Output State: **`a` is a sorted list containing the two integers `n` and `k`, `r` is equal to `n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**

The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `y`. Since `a`, `r`, and `rem` were not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the original variables and the new value of `y`.
