Output State: **`n` is the first positive integer entered, `k` is the second positive integer entered**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. Since the initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be a positive integer, we know that both `n` and `k` will be positive integers. The values of other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
