Output State: **`i` is 8, `k` is 0, `rem` is `k % 9`, and `y` is `n - 9`**.

Explanation: The code sets `k` to 0. This directly updates the value of `k`. Since `rem` is defined as `k % 9`, and `k` is now 0, `rem` also becomes 0. The values of `i`, `r`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
