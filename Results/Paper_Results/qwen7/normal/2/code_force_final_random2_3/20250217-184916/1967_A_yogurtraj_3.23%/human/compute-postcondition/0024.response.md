Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is `a[1] + 0 // 2`, `rem` is `0 % 2`, `y` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the loop or the most internal if statement it is within. Since there was no loop or if statement specified in the code, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
