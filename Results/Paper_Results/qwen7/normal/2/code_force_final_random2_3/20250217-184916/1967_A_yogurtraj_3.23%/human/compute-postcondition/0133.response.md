Output State: **`i` is `n`, `r` is `a[n-1]`, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will increment to `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`. The variable `r` will be set to the last element of the list `a` since the loop continues until it can no longer satisfy the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`. Since `k` is eventually reduced to 0 through the loop's decrement operation, `k` will be 0 at the end. The variables `rem` and `y` are not affected by the loop and remain 0 as per the initial conditions and the loop logic.
