Output State: **`a` is a sorted list containing the two integers `n` and `k`, `r` is equal to `n`, `rem` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `rem` to 0. The values of `a`, `n`, `k`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `a` is still a sorted list containing the integers `n` and `k`, `r` is still equal to `n`, and `rem` is 0.
