Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is `a[1] + 0 // 2`, `rem` is `0 % 2`, `y` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state. Specifically, `r` simplifies to `a[1] + 0 // 2`, which is `a[1]`, and `rem` simplifies to `0 % 2`, which is 0.
