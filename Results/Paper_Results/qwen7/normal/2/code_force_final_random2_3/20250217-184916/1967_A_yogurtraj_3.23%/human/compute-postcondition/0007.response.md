Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(0, n - 1)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 (since `range(0, n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n-2`).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state of `n`**: Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1 (because if `n` were 1 or less, `i` would never reach `n - 1`).

5. **Other variables**: The variables `a`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
