Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n`
   - `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`
   - `k` is 0
   - `rem` is 0
   - `y` is 0

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is directly given as `n`.
   - `r` is defined as `a[n-1] + k // n`. Since `k` is 0, this simplifies to `a[n-1] + 0 // n`, which further simplifies to `a[n-1] + 0`, so `r` is simply `a[n-1]`.
   - `k`, `rem`, and `y` are not used in the print statement and do not affect the value of `r`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `(r - 1) * n + 1`.
   - Substituting the value of `r` from the initial state, we get `(a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the expression `(a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1`.

Output: **(a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1**
