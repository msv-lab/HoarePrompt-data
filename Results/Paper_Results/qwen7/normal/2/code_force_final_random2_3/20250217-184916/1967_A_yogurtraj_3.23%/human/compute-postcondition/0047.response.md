Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for ii in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `ii`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0. This means that the value of `ii` must be less than `int(input())`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `k` is either 0 or not 0
   - `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`
   - `rem` is 0
   - `y` is -1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ii` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to adjust its value.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` was some value (let's call it `ii_prev`), and the loop continued because `ii_prev < int(input())`.
   - For the loop to continue, `ii` must be incremented by 1, so the new value of `ii` will be `ii_prev + 1`.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `r` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `rem` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `y` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only thing that changes is the value of `ii`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or not 0, `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is -1, `ii` is `ii_prev + 1`**.

Since the exact value of `ii_prev` is not given, we can represent it symbolically as `ii_prev + 1`. However, if we assume the loop just started or the previous value of `ii` was not specified, we can say `ii` is 0 (assuming the loop starts from 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or not 0, `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is -1, `ii` is 0**.
