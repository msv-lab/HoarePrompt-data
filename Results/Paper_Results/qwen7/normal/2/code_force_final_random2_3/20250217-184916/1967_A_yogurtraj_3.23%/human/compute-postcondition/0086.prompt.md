Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is either 0 or not 0, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is at least 2, `k` is updated as follows: if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` remains unchanged and `r` is set to `a[3] + 0 // 4` with `rem` being `0 % 4` and `y` being `n - 1 - 3`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 4, `n` is at least 5, if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[4] + 0 // 5`, `rem` is `0 % 5`, `y` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 5, `n` is greater than 6, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`. If the condition is true, then `r` is `a[5] + 0 // 6`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the condition is false, then `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is `a[6]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
