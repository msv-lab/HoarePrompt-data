Postcondition: **`i` is 4, `n` is at least 5, if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[4] + 0 // 5`, `rem` is `0 % 5`, `y` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`**.
