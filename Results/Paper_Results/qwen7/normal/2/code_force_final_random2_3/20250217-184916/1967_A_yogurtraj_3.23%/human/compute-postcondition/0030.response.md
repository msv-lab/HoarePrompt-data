Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is updated based on the new value of `i`, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `rem` is 0, `y` is not specified as it is not used in the else part.**

Explanation: The code updates `r` to the value of `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 2, `r` becomes `a[2] + k // 3`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being greater than 1, `k` updated based on the new value of `i`, `rem` remaining 0, and `y` not specified as it is not used in the else part.
