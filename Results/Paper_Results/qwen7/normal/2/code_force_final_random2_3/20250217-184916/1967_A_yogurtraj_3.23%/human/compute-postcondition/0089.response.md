Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 7.
   - `n` is greater than 8.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `r` is `a[7] + 0 // n`. Since `0 // n` is 0 (as any number divided by a non-zero number is 0), `r` simplifies to `a[7]`.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is `n - 3`.
   - `ii` is 0.
   - `r` is also equal to `a[n - 1]` since `k // n` is 0. Given `k` is 0, `k // n` is 0, so `r` is indeed `a[n - 1]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print((r - 1) * n + 1)
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the value of `r`:
- From the initial state, `r` is `a[7]` and also `a[n - 1]`. Since `n` is greater than 8, `n - 1` is at least 7. Therefore, `r` is `a[7]`.

Now, substituting `r` into the print statement:
- The expression becomes `(a[7] - 1) * n + 1`.

Since `n` is greater than 8, let's denote `n` as `n_val` where `n_val > 8`. The expression then becomes:
- `(a[7] - 1) * n_val + 1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **(a[7] - 1) * n + 1**
