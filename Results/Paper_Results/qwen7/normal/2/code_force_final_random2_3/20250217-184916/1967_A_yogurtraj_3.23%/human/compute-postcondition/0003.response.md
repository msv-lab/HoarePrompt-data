Output State: **`a` is a sorted list containing the two integers `n` and `k`, `n` is the first positive integer entered, `k` is the second positive integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `a` initially contains two integers `n` and `k`, after sorting, `a` will contain these two integers in ascending order. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and they are still the first and second positive integers entered, respectively.
