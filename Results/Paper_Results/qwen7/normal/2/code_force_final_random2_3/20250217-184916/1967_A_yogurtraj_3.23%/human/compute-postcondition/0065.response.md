Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is at least 2, `k` is updated as follows: if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` remains unchanged and `r` is set to `a[3] + 0 // 4` with `rem` being `0 % 4` and `y` being `n - 1 - 3`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.
