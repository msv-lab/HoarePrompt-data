Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is either 0 or not 0, `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is -1, `ii` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a list, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. The values of other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, `ii`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
