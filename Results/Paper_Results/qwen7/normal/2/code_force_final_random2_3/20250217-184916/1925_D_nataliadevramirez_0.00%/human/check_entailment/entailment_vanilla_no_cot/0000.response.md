To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- For each pair of friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion they are chosen.
- The probability of choosing any specific pair in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\), but since we are dealing with pairs, the probability simplifies to \(\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).

### Given Code:
```python
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        # Each pair is chosen with probability 2/(n*(n-1)), and if chosen, their value increases by 1 each time.
        # Expected increase per excursion for each pair = (2 / (n * (n-1))) * k
        # Since the friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion, the expected value for each pair is k.
        result += f * k
    return result % MOD

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)
```

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function iterates over each friendship and adds the friendship value \( f \) multiplied by \( k \) to the result.
- This logic assumes that the expected value of the friendship value for each pair is \( k \), which is correct because each pair, if chosen, will have its value increased by 1 for each of the \( k \) excursions.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
- The input handling and output formatting are correct.

### Conclusion:
The logic in both functions appears to be correct based on the problem statement and the given example. The expected value calculation for each pair is correctly implemented.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**True**
