### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair who are not friends remains 0 and does not change.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over all pairs of friends and adds the product of the friendship value \( f \) and the combination \( \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \) to the result.
   - This combination \( \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \) represents the number of ways to choose 2 excursions out of \( k \) excursions, which is incorrect for calculating the expected value.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program does not correctly calculate the expected value because it does not account for the probability of choosing each pair of friends.
- The formula used in `func_1` is incorrect because it assumes each pair is chosen with equal probability, which is not true.

#### Correct Approach:
- To correctly calculate the expected value, we need to use the probability of each pair being chosen at least once.
- The correct expected value for a single pair of friends can be derived using the concept of the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in \( k \) trials.

#### Correct Calculation:
- For a single pair of friends, the probability of being chosen in a single trial is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
- The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in \( k \) trials is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
- Since the friendship value increases by 1 for each choice, the expected value for a single pair is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \times f \).

#### Implementation:
- The correct implementation should iterate over all pairs of friends and sum the expected values for each pair.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly calculate the expected value because it uses an incorrect formula.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of choosing each pair of friends, leading to an incorrect expected value calculation.
