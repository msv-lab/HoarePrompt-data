Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the number of children (input integer), `m` is the number of pairs of friends (input integer), `k` is the number of excursions (input integer), `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively (input list of lists), and `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial conditions for `t`, `friendships`, and `result` remain unchanged.
