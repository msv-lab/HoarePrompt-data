Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the number of children (input integer), `m` is the number of pairs of friends (input integer), `k` is the number of excursions (input integer), `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively (input list of lists), `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

The code reads three integers from the input using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These values are then assigned to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The other variables (`t`, `friendships`, and `result`) remain unchanged.
