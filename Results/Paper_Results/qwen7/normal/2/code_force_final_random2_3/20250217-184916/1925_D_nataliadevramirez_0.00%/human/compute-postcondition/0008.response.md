Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the number of children (input integer), `m` is the number of pairs of friends (input integer), `k` is the number of excursions (input integer), `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively (input list of lists), and `friendships` is updated to a list of lists containing integers read from input.**

Explanation: The code reads `m` lines of input, where each line contains three integers separated by spaces. These integers are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())` and then added to the `friendships` list. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were assigned before. The `friendships` list is updated to contain the new values read from input.
