Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is the `for _ in range(t):` statement. The only variable directly controlled by this loop is `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the number of children (input integer).
   - `m` is the number of pairs of friends (input integer).
   - `k` is the number of excursions (input integer).
   - `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively (input list of lists).
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, we need to decrement `t` by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`, and `result`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`, and `result` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the number of children (input integer), `m` is the number of pairs of friends (input integer), `k` is the number of excursions (input integer), `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively (input list of lists), and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.
