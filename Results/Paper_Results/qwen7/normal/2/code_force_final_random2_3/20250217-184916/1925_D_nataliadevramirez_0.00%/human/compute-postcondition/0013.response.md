Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the number of children (input integer), `m` is the number of pairs of friends (input integer), `k` is the number of excursions (input integer), `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively (input list of lists), `friendships` is updated to a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `friendships` by iterating `m` times and reading input for each iteration. Each input is split and converted to integers, creating a list `[a_i, b_i, f_i]` for each iteration, which is appended to the `friendships` list. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are already assigned from the input, so they remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 is also preserved.
