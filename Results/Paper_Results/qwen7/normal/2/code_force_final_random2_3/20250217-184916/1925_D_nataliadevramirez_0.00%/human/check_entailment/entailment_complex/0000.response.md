Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the expected value contribution for each friendship value `f` when considering `k` excursions. 
   - The formula used, `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`, is correct because:
     - `(k * (k + 1) // 2)` represents the number of ways to choose 2 excursions out of `k` (i.e., combinations of `k` taken 2 at a time).
     - Multiplying each friendship value `f` by this combination gives the expected increase in the friendship value over `k` excursions.
   - The function correctly handles the modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the necessary inputs for each test case, including the number of children (`n`), pairs of friends (`m`), and excursions (`k`), and then processes the list of friendships.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters for each test case and prints the results.
   - The overall logic and flow of the function match the problem requirements.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - Both functions together correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.
   - There are no logical errors or missing parts in the provided code.

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
