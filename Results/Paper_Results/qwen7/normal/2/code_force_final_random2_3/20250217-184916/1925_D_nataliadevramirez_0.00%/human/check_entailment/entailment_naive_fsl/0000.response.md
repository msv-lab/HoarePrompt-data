Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the calculation in `func_1` does not account for the probability of choosing each pair of friends. 

The formula used in `func_1` is:
\[ \text{result} += f \times \left(\frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2}\right) \% \text{MOD} \]

This formula assumes that each pair is chosen with equal probability, which is incorrect. The correct approach would involve calculating the probability of each pair being chosen at least once and then using that to compute the expected value.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
- There are 2 children and 1 pair of friends with a friendship value of 1.
- The teacher goes on 1 excursion.
- The expected value should be calculated based on the probability of choosing the pair of friends.

The correct expected value for this case is 1, but the given program will output 0, which is incorrect.
