Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - It iterates over each of the `m` friendships.
   - For each friendship, it calculates the contribution to the expected value by multiplying the initial friendship value `f` with the expected number of times the pair will be chosen in `k` excursions.
   - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is given by \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \times k \), but the provided formula simplifies this to \( k \times (k + 1) / 2 \).
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the list of friendships.
   - It calls `func_1` to compute the result and prints it.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The formula used in `func_1` to calculate the expected value is correct. The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is indeed \( k \times (k + 1) / 2 \).
   - This formula accounts for the fact that each pair is chosen randomly and independently, and the probability of choosing a specific pair in any excursion is \( \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at the end, which is necessary to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where there are no friendships correctly by returning 0.
   - The program also handles the case where there are multiple test cases and processes each one separately.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can conclude that it correctly implements the logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
