Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the number of children (input integer), `m` is the number of pairs of friends (input integer), `k` is the number of excursions (input integer), `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively (input list of lists), and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.

The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. Since the function name and its implementation are not provided, the value of `result` is the return value of this function call. The other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
