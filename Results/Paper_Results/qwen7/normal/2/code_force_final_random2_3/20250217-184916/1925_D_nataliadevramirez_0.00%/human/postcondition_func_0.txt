The function accepts parameters n (the number of children), m (the number of pairs of friends), k (the number of excursions), and friendships (a list of tuples containing the indices of pairs of children who are friends and their friendship values). It calculates the sum of each friendship value multiplied by the combination of k excursions taken two at a time (k * (k + 1) // 2), modulo a constant MOD (\(10^9 + 7\)). The function returns this calculated sum.
