Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that if the substring of `a[0]` up to index `i + 1` is equal to the substring of `s` up to index `i + 1`, then the values of `a`, `s`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. This means that unless the substrings match, the values of `a`, `s`, `i`, and `t` will change.

3. **Determine the New State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(x)`, the variable `i` will increment by 1 at each iteration.
   - The variable `x` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.
   - The variables `a`, `s`, and `t` will only remain unchanged if the substrings match; otherwise, they would be updated according to the loop body (which is omitted).

Given that the loop is about to start its next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `x` remains the same.
- `a`, `s`, and `t` will remain unchanged if the substrings match; otherwise, they might be updated based on the loop body.

Since the problem asks us to focus on the states that can be adjusted within the loop head, and considering the loop head involves only `i` and `x`, we can only adjust these two.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a list of strings, `s` is a string, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `x - (i + 1) + 1`, and `x` is the same as before.**
