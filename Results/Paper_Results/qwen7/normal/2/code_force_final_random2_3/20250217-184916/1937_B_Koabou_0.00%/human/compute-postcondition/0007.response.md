Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the original input integer, the second element is the new input integer, and the third element is the input integer from the append method, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the input value to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains two elements: the first element is the original input integer, and the second element is the new input integer. After executing the code, `a` now has three elements: the original input integer, the new input integer, and the current input integer from the `append` method. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
