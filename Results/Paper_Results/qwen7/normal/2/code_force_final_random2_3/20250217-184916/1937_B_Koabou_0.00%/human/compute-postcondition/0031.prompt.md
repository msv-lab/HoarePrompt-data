Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the original input integer, the second element is the new input integer, the third element is another input integer, and the fourth element is yet another input integer, `n` retains its initial value as an input integer, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
        s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
        x = i
        break
else:
    s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
    x = n - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the original input integer, the second element is the new input integer, the third element is another input integer, and the fourth element is yet another input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first `i + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the first `i` elements of `a[1]`, `x` is 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements, `n` must be at least 1, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first 2 elements of `a[0]` and the first 1 element of `a[1]`, `x` is 1, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, if `a[0][i + 1]` equals '1' and `a[1][i]` equals '0'. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged, `x` is 0, and `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements, `n` must be at least 1, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first 3 elements of `a[0]` and the first 1 element of `a[1]`, `x` is 2, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
