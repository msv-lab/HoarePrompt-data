Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `a` remains an empty list. The value of `n` is the integer input provided by the user.
