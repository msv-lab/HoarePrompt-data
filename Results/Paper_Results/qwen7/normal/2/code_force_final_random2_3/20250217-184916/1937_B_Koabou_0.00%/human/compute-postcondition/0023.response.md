Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements, `n` must be at least 1, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first 2 elements of `a[0]` and the first 1 element of `a[1]`, `x` is 1, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, if `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0'. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged, `x` is 0, and `i` is 1.
