The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4), an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) of length \( n \). It then finds the longest common prefix between \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \) and prints the concatenated string \( s \) formed by combining the prefix of \( a_1 \) and the suffix of \( a_2 \). Finally, it prints the length of this common prefix.
