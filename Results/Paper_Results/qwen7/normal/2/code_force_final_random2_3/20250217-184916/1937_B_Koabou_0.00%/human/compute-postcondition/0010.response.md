Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the original input integer, the second element is the new input integer, the third element is another input integer, and the fourth element is yet another input integer, `n` retains its initial value as an input integer, `s` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `s`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, or `n`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer within the specified range, `a` retains its structure with four input integers, and `n` keeps its initial value. The list `s` is now empty.
