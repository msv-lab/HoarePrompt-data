Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input integer, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the input value (converted to a string) to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty list, after appending the input, `a` now contains one element, which is the input integer. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
