You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. The grasshopper can move right or down in a 2xn grid, and the string is formed by concatenating the values of the cells it visits in order.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid.
   - It then constructs the lexicographically smallest string `s` and counts the number of such paths `x`.

3. **Constructing the Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - The code checks if there is a point where the top row has a '1' and the bottom row has a '0'. If such a point exists, it constructs the string `s` up to that point and sets `x` to the index of that point.
   - If no such point exists, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the entire top row and the last character of the bottom row, setting `x` to the last index.

4. **Counting Paths**:
   - The code then counts the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string by checking how many times the prefix of the top row matches the prefix of the constructed string `s`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where no '1' in the top row is followed by a '0' in the bottom row correctly by appending the entire bottom row to the top row.
   - The counting logic seems to be correct as it checks the prefix match and updates the count accordingly.

6. **Verification**:
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the code.
   - The code logic aligns with the problem requirements.

Conclusion:
The given program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the example given.

Correctness: **True**
