Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the original input integer, the second element is the new input integer, the third element is another input integer, and the fourth element is yet another input integer, `n` is an input integer.

This means after the loop executes all its iterations (which is 2 iterations in this case), the list `a` will contain four elements, each being an input integer from the `append` method calls within the loop. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop, and `n` is still an input integer, though its value is not specified in the problem statement.
