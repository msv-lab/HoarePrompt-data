Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for char in password:`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `char` and `password`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the `password` string.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `password` is a string of length 1 <= n <= 20, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
   - If the first character of `password` is a digit, then `digits` is a list containing this digit.
   - If the first character of `password` is a lowercase Latin letter, then `letters` is a list containing this letter.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - After processing one character from `password`, the length of `password` will decrease by 1.
   - The variable `char` will hold the current character being processed.
   - If the new first character (after removing the previously processed character) is a digit, `digits` will update accordingly.
   - If the new first character is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` will update accordingly.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The length of `password` will be reduced by 1.
   - If the new first character is a digit, `digits` will contain this digit.
   - If the new first character is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` will contain this letter.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `password` will be the remaining substring of the original `password` after removing the first character.
- `char` will be the first character of the updated `password`.
- `digits` and `letters` will be updated based on the new first character of `password`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`password` is a string of length 0 < n <= 19, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. If the first character of `password` is a digit, then `digits` is a list containing this digit. If the first character of `password` is a lowercase Latin letter, then `letters` is a list containing this letter. `char` is the first character of `password`.**
