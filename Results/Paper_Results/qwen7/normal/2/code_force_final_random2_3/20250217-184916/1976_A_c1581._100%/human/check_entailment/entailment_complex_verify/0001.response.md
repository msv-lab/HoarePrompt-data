### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - This part is accurate and correctly implemented.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Separation of Digits and Letters**:
     - The function correctly separates digits and letters into two lists.
   - **Sorting**:
     - The function sorts both lists, which is necessary for the subsequent checks.
   - **Checking Non-Decreasing Order of Digits**:
     - The function checks if any digit is greater than the next digit, ensuring the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - **Checking No Digit After Letter**:
     - The function checks if any digit is greater than any preceding letter, ensuring no digit comes after a letter.
   - **Constructing Sorted Password**:
     - The function constructs a sorted password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
   - **Comparing Sorted Password with Original**:
     - The function compares the constructed sorted password with the original password to ensure they match, indicating the password meets all conditions.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if the password is strong and "NO" otherwise, which aligns with the problem statement.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the function `func_1`. Specifically, the check `if i < len(letters)` in the loop should be `if i < len(digits)`. This is because the function needs to ensure that the last digit is not greater than any preceding letter, not any preceding character in the `letters` list. This mistake can lead to incorrect results, especially when the password contains both digits and letters.

### Example to Illustrate the Flaw:
Consider the password `123abc`. According to the problem statement, this password should be considered strong because:
- All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order (`123`).
- All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order (`abc`).
- There are no digits coming after letters.

However, the current implementation will incorrectly return `False` because the loop checks if `digits[-1] > letters[i]` for all `i < len(letters)`, which includes checking against letters that come after the last digit. This violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

### Corrected Implementation:
To fix this, we need to change the condition in the loop to `if i < len(digits)`:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(digits) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the corrected implementation, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the overall logic but missed the specific flaw in the condition check. Therefore, the original assessment should be overturned.

**Final: False**
