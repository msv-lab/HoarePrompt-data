Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly separates the digits and letters from the password.
2. It sorts the digits and letters individually.
3. It checks two main conditions:
   - Whether the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - Whether the last digit is not greater than any letter in the password.
4. After sorting, it concatenates the digits and letters to form a new password and compares it with the original password. If they match, it means the original password was already sorted according to the rules.
5. The logic in the function correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Given the annotated program and the reasoning above, the function `func_1` correctly verifies whether a password meets the specified criteria.

Correctness: **True**
