Output State: **The `letters` list is sorted in ascending order. The `digits` list remains sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `letters.sort()` sorts the `letters` list in ascending order. The `digits` list was initially sorted in ascending order and remains unchanged since it is not affected by the sorting operation on `letters`.
