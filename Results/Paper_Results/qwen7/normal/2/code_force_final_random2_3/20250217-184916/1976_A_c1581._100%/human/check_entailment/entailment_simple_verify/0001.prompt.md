You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string of length 1 <= n <= 20, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: All characters from the original `password` have been processed, and the variables `letters` and `digits` contain all the letters and digits from the original `password`, respectively.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all iterations without returning False, meaning that for every `i` in the range of `len(digits)`, the following conditions hold:
    #- `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1` and `digits[i]` is less than or equal to `digits[i + 1]`.
    #- For all `i` where `i` is less than `len(letters)`, `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`.
    #
    #This means the loop completes all its iterations without finding any pair of consecutive elements in `digits` that are out of order, and also ensures that the last element of `digits` is not greater than any element in `letters`.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It separates digits and letters into two lists.
   - It sorts both lists.
   - It checks if any digit is greater than the next digit, which ensures the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if any digit is greater than any preceding letter, ensuring no digit comes after a letter.
   - It constructs a sorted password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
   - It compares the constructed sorted password with the original password to ensure they match, indicating the password meets all conditions.
3. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if the password is strong and "NO" otherwise, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify whether a password is strong according to the given conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
