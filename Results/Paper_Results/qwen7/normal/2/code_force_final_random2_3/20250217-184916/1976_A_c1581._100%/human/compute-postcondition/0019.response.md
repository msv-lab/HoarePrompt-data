Output State: **All characters from the original `password` have been processed, and the variables `letters` and `digits` contain all the letters and digits from the original `password`, respectively.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, every character in the original `password` string has been checked. If a character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list; if it is a lowercase Latin letter, it is appended to the `letters` list. The `password` variable is eventually reduced to an empty string as all characters are processed. The final state of the program will have `password` being an empty string, `letters` containing all the letters from the original `password` in the order they appeared, and `digits` containing all the digits from the original `password` in the order they appeared.
