Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are both letters and digits in the password, and the digits are not sorted in non-decreasing order. Specifically, the program checks if the sorted digits are in non-decreasing order and if the last digit is greater than any of the letters, but it does not ensure that all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order relative to each other.

For example, consider the password "123a". According to the problem description, this password should be "NO" because the digits "1", "2", and "3" are not in non-decreasing order relative to each other (they are already in order, but the problem requires checking the order among all digits). However, the current implementation will incorrectly return "YES" for this password.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all digits are in non-decreasing order relative to each other before comparing them with the letters. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    
    # Check if digits are in non-decreasing order
    for i in range(len(digits) - 1):
        if digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
    
    # Check if all digits are in non-decreasing order relative to each other
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This corrected version ensures that all digits are in non-decreasing order relative to each other, which is necessary to meet the problem requirements.
