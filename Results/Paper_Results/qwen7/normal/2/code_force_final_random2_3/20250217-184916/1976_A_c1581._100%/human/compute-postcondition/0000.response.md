Output State: **`password` is a string of length 1 <= n <= 20, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `digits`. The value of `password` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, with each character being either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
