### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It separates digits and letters into two lists.
   - It sorts both lists.
   - It checks if any digit is greater than the next digit, which ensures the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if any digit is greater than any preceding letter, ensuring no digit comes after a letter.
   - It constructs a sorted password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
   - It compares the constructed sorted password with the original password to ensure they match, indicating the password meets all conditions.
3. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if the password is strong and "NO" otherwise, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to verify whether a password is strong according to the given conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
