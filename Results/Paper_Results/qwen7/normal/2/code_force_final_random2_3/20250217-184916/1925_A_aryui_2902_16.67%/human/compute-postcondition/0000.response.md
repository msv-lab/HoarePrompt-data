Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 676.
