Functionality: **The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, where `n` represents the number of repetitions and `k` is the length of the substring to be taken from the string `s`. It then returns a new string consisting of the substring of `s` (which is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw') from the start up to the `k`-th character, repeated `n` times.**
