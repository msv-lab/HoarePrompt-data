Reasoning:  
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by sorting the first half (`b`) and the second half (`c`) of the array `a`. It then constructs the arrays `ans1` and `ans2` by ensuring that the XOR of their elements matches. However, the logic in the code has some issues:

1. **Initialization and Logic for `l`:**
   - The code tries to initialize `l` with certain conditions but does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, the conditions for adding elements to `l` are not comprehensive enough to cover all necessary cases.

2. **Building `ans1` and `ans2`:**
   - The code attempts to build `ans1` and `ans2` by pairing consecutive elements in `b` and `c` respectively. However, it does not ensure that the XOR of `ans1` and `ans2` will be equal, which is a critical requirement of the problem.

3. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - The code uses `l` to fill the remaining elements in `ans1` and `ans2`, but it does not ensure that the XOR condition is met. The approach of simply appending elements from `l` to both `ans1` and `ans2` without checking the XOR condition might lead to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not guarantee that the XOR of the elements in `ans1` and `ans2` will be equal, which is a fundamental requirement of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
