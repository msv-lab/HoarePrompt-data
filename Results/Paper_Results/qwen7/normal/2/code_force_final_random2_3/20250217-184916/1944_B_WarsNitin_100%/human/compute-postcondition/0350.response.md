Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of `l`; `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of `l`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 1) of list `l` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 1, `ans2` now contains the element at index 1 of `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
