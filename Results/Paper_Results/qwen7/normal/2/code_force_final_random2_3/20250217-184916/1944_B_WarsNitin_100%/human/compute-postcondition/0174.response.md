Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, and if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `l` is a list containing either the element `b[2]` or both `b[2]` and `b[3]` based on whether `b[2]` is equal to `b[3]`. If `b[2]` is not equal to `b[3]`, then `l` contains only `b[2]`.
