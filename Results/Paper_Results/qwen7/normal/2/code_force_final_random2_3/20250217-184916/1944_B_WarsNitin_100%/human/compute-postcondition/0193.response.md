Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `b` from index 1 to `n-2`, `l` is a list containing the last unique element of `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains as an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is inside. Since no specific loop or conditional statement is mentioned, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial states.
