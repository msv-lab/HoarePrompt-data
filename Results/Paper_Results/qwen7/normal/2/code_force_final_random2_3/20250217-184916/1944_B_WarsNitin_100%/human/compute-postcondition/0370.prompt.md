Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 5000.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    if b[0] != b[1]:
        l.append(b[0])
    if b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    else:
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        k -= 2
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
            l.append(b[i])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
        k -= 1
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `k` is -n, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `ans2` contains all elements that met the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` for some `i` in the range (1, n-1) in pairs, and `ans1` includes all elements from `l` up to the point where the loop terminated.

Explanation: Given that the loop continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and considering the output state after the loop executes 3 times, we can infer that `k` starts at 0 and decreases by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, after `n` iterations, `k` will be `-n`. The value of `i` increases by 1 with each iteration, starting from `n` (the initial value of `i`), so after `n` iterations, `i` will be `n + (n - 1) = 2 * n - 1`. Both `ans1` and `ans2` continue to accumulate elements from `l` based on the given conditions, resulting in `ans1` containing all elements from `l` and `ans2` containing all pairs of consecutive elements from `l` that meet the specified condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n`, `ans1` includes the elements at indices 0 to `n-3` of `l`, and `ans2` includes the elements at indices 1 to `n-2` of `l` twice each.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is less than or equal to 0, `ans1` contains the entire list `l`, and `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from the list `c` starting from index 1 up to `n-1` unless `k` becomes 0 before reaching the end of the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
