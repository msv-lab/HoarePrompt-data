Output State: **`b` is a sorted version of the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is sorted, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**

The code `k = 2 * k` simply multiplies the original value of `k` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
