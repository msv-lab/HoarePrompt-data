Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know the following:
   - `k` is `-n`.
   - `i` is `2 * n - 1`.
   - `ans2` contains all elements that met the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` for some `i` in the range (1, n-1) in pairs.
   - `ans1` includes all elements from `l` up to the point where the loop terminated.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Current Iteration**: Since `k` is `-n` at the end of the previous iteration, it means the loop has executed `n` times (because `k` starts at 0 and decreases by 1 each time the loop runs).

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0. Since `k` is currently `-n`, the next iteration would decrease `k` to `-n - 1`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `k` will be `-n - 1`.
   - `i` will increase by 1 from `2 * n - 1` to `2 * n`.
   - `ans1` and `ans2` will continue to accumulate elements based on the conditions given, but since no specific changes are mentioned for these lists within the loop body, they remain the same.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `k` and `i`.

**State:**
State: **`k` is -n - 1, `i` is 2 * n**
