Output State: **`i` is 0, `len(l)` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `len(l)`, or `k`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code snippet, the values remain unchanged.
