Output State: **Postcondition: `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans1` contains all elements that met the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]` for some `i` in the range (1, n-1), and `l` is a list containing the first and last elements of `b` if `b[n-2]` equals `b[n-1]`, otherwise it is an empty list.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `k` will be 0 because the loop breaks when `k` becomes 0. The variable `i` will be 0 since the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and once `i` reaches `n-1`, the loop condition `i < n-1` fails. The list `ans1` will contain all elements that satisfy the condition `b[i] == b[i - 1]` for any `i` in the range (1, n-1). The list `l` will either contain the first and last elements of `b` if `b[n-2]` equals `b[n-1]`, or it will be an empty list if `b[n-2]` does not equal `b[n-1]`.
