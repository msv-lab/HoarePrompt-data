Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is `t`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list containing the elements from index `n` to the end of `a`, `c` is sorted in ascending order, `req` is `k`, `l` is a list containing the element `b[0]` if `b[0] != b[1]`; otherwise, `l` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends the last element of `b` to `ans1`. Since `b` is a list of the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `b[n-1]` is the last element of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
