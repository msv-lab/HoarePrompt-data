Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[1, n - 2]`. This means `i` should start at 1 and continue as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `i` starts at 1 and that `n` is such that the loop can run until `i` reaches `n - 2`.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `i` starts at 1 and `n` is large enough to allow the loop to run.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2**
