Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of `l`; `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of `l`.**

The value of `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. However, since `k` was not directly referenced in the initial state and no other variables were affected by this operation, the values of `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
