Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and the list `ans2` now contains the element `c[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Since `k` is 0, the condition to break out of the loop is not met, and the value of `i` is updated to `i_prev + 1`. The list `ans2` remains unchanged in terms of its structure but now includes the new element `c[i]`.
