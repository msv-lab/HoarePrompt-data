Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ans1` includes the elements at indices 0 to `n-3` of `l`, `ans2` includes the elements at indices 1 to `n-2` of `l` twice each, `q` is `t`, `n` and `k` are integers input from the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings using space as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The variables `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `q`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
