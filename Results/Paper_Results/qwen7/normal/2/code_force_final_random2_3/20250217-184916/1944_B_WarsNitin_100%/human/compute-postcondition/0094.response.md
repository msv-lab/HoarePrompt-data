Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `ans2` now contains the element `c[i]` appended to it.**

This means that `k` retains its value of 0, `i` is updated to `i_prev + 2`, and `ans2` now includes the element `c[i]` appended to it, assuming `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`. If `c[i]` does not equal `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` would remain unchanged from its previous state.
