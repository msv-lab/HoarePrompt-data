Output State: **`k` is 0 and `i` is 1; `ans1` contains the element `b[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 1, `b[i]` refers to the element at index 1 of the list `b`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `b`, we only know that `ans1` now contains the element at index 1 of `b`. The values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged.
