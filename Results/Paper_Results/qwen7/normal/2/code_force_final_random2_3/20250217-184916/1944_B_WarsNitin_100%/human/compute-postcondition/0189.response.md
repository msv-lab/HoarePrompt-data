Output State: **`k` is assigned the value of `req`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `b` from index 1 to `n-2`, `l` is a list containing the last unique element of `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains as an empty list.**

In this case, the code simply assigns the value of `req` to the variable `k`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
