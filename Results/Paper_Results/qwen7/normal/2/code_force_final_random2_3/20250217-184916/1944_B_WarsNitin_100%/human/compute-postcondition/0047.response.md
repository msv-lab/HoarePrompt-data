Output State: **`k` is 0 and `i` is `n-1`; `ans1` now contains the element `b[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is `n-1` initially, `b[i]` refers to the last element of the list `b`. The values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
