Output State: `k` is -2 * (n-1), `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `b` from index 1 to `n-2`, `l` is a list containing the last unique element of `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains as an empty list, `ans2` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements starting from `c[1]` up to `c[n-1]`.

Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `k` by 2 each time `c[i]` equals `c[i-1]`. Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, it will run `n-1` times. Therefore, `k` will be `-2 * (n-1)`. Once `i` reaches `n`, the loop condition `i < n` fails, and the loop terminates. All other variables (`ans1`, `l`, and `ans2`) retain their state from the last iteration since they are not modified outside the loop body. `ans2` accumulates pairs of consecutive duplicates from the start of the list up to the point where the loop exits.
