Postcondition: `k` is -6, `i` is 5, `n` is greater than 4, `ans1` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `b` from index 1 to `n-2`, `l` is a list containing the last unique element of `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains as an empty list, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, then `k` remains -6.
