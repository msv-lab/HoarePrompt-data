Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and the list `ans2` now contains the elements `c[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to -2. The values of `i` and the list `ans2` remain unchanged from their initial states. `i` is still `i_prev + 1`, and `ans2` still contains the elements `c[i]` appended to it.
