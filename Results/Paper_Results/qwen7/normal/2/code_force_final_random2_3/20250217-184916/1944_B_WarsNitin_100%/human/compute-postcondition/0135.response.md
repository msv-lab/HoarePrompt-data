Output State: **`b` is a sorted version of the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is sorted, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is the original value of `k`.**

Explanation: The line `req = k` assigns the current value of `k` to `req`. Since `k` was previously 2 times its original value, `req` now holds that value. The other variables remain unchanged.
