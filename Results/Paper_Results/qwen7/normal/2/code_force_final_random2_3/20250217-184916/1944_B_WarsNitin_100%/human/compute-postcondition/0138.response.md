Postcondition: `b` is a sorted version of the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is sorted, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is the original value of `k`, `l` is a list containing `b[0]`. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `l` is updated to contain `b[0]`.
