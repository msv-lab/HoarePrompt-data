Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans1` includes the elements at indices 0 and 2 of `l`, `ans2` includes the element at index 1 of `l` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no such loop or if statement is mentioned in the initial state or the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
