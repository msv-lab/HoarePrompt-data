Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is `n + 2`, `ans2` includes the pair of elements `l[i]` and the previous element that met the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, and `ans1` includes the element `l[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element `l[i]` to the list `ans2`. The value of `k` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `ans1` still includes the element `l[i]`. Since the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` was previously met, `ans2` continues to include the pair of elements that met this condition.
