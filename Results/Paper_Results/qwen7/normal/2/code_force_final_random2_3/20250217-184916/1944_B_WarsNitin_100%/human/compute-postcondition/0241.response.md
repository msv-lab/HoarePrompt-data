Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans1` includes the elements at indices 0 and 2 of `l` and appends the element at index 2 of `l`; `ans2` includes the element at index 1 of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans1` now includes the elements at indices 0 and 2 of `l` and also appends the element at index 2 of `l`. The values of `ans2` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
