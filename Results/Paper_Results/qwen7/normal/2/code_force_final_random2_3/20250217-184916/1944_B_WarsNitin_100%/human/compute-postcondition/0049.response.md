Output State: **`k` is -2 and `i` is `n-1`; `ans1` now contains the element `b[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2, making it -2. The values of `i` and `ans1` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `n-1` and `ans1` still contains the element `b[i]` appended to it.
