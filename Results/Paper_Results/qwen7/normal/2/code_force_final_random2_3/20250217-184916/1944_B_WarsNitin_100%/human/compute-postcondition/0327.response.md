Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans2` contains the element `c[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, `c[3]` is appended to `ans2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
