Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` sorted elements, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, `c` is sorted.**

The code `c.sort()` sorts the sublist `c`, which contains the remaining elements after the first `n` elements of `a`. The sorting operation modifies `c` in place, so now `c` is sorted. All other variables remain unchanged.
