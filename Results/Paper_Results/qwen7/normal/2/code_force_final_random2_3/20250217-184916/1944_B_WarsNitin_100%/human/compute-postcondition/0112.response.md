Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is `n + 1`, `ans2` contains all elements that met the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` for some `i` in the range (1, n-1) in pairs, and `ans2` now includes the element `l[i]`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from -1 to -2. The values of `i` and `ans2` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them directly. Therefore, `i` remains `n + 1`, and `ans2` retains its original state, which includes all elements that met the specified condition and the element `l[i]`.
