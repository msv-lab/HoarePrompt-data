Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` sorted elements, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, `c` is sorted, `ans1` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans1`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged, and `ans1` is now an empty list.
