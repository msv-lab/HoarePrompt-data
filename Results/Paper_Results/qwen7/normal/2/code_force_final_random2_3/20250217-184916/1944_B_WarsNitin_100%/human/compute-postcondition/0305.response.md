Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is 0, and `l` contains the element `b[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 3, `l` will now contain `b[3]`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Since `k` is 0, the condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is not met, so no such action is taken.
