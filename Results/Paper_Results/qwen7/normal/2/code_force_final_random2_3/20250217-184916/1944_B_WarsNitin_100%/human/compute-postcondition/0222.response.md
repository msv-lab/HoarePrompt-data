Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is used as the index in the `range` function.
   - `len(l)`: This is the upper limit of the `range` function.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - From the given information, `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `len(l)` is derived from the length of the list `l`.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(l) - 1`.
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, the loop will not execute if `n` is less than the length of `l`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `i` should start from `0` and `len(l)` should be at least `1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `len(l) - 1`).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `0`.
- `len(l)` should be greater than `0`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `len(l)` must be greater than 0**
