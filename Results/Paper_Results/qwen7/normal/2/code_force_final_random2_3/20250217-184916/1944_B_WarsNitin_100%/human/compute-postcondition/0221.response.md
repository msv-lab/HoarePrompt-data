Output State: `k` is -2 * (n-1), `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `b` from index 1 to `n-2`, `l` is a list containing the last unique element of `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains as an empty list, `ans2` is a list containing all values of `c[i]` for each iteration where `c[i]` was equal to `c[i-1]`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. For each iteration, if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i-1]`, `k` is decremented by 2 and the value of `c[i]` is appended twice to `ans2`. The loop continues until `k` becomes 0 or the loop reaches `i = n-1`. After all iterations, `k` will be `-2 * (n-1)` because it starts at 0 and is decremented by 2 for each pair of consecutive duplicates. The variable `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` on each iteration and stops when `i` reaches `n`. The other variables (`ans1`, `l`, `c`) remain unchanged unless they were modified outside the loop, but based on the given information, they do not change.
