Postcondition: `k` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is set to -2 and a list `ans2` containing the value of `c[i]` is created. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, then no changes are made to `k` and `ans2` remains unchanged.
