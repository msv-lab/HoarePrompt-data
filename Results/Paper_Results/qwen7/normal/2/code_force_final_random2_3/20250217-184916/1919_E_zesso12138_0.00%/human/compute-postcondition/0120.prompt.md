You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and p is a list of n integers where |p[i]| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        
        dp = new_dp
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `dp` will be a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element `dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 \times n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`. This means that after all iterations of the loop, each element in `dp` will contain the cumulative sum of all positive values from the previous iterations, starting from the initial condition where `dp[n]` is set to 1 and all other elements are zero.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `dp` list will contain the cumulative effect of all the updates made to it over the course of the loop, with each element being the sum of all previously updated positive values, taken modulo `MOD`.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is equal to `p[-1] + offset` and `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element `dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 \times n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer within the range of 1 to 5000, and `p`, a sorted list of `n` integers where the absolute value of each element does not exceed `n`. It returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the last element of `p` plus an offset, and `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\). Each element `dp[j]` in `dp` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 \times n\)) represents the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values that are greater than 0, taken modulo `MOD`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is equal to `p[-1] + offset` and `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element `dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 \times n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
