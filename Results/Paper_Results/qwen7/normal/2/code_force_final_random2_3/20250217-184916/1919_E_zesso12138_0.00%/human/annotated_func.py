    #State: Output State: The final state of `dp` will be a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element `dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 \times n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`. This means that after all iterations of the loop, each element in `dp` will contain the cumulative sum of all positive values from the previous iterations, starting from the initial condition where `dp[n]` is set to 1 and all other elements are zero.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `dp` list will contain the cumulative effect of all the updates made to it over the course of the loop, with each element being the sum of all previously updated positive values, taken modulo `MOD`.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is equal to `p[-1] + offset` and `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element `dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 \times n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer within the range of 1 to 5000, and `p`, a sorted list of `n` integers where the absolute value of each element does not exceed `n`. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with all elements set to 0, except for the middle element which is set to 1. The function then iterates through the array, updating each element based on the values of its neighboring elements, ensuring that only positive values contribute to the update. After completing these iterations, the function calculates `final_sum` as the last element of `p` plus an offset `n`. Finally, it returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, which represents the cumulative sum of all previously updated positive values in the `dp` array, taken modulo `MOD`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.

        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations includes `data` remaining unchanged, `index` being `index + 3 * (n + 3)`, `t` reduced to `t - 3`, `p` being a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index` and of length `n` for each iteration, `result` being the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and `results` being a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for all iterations.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: `res` is an element of `results` for each iteration of the loop, and since the loop prints each element of `results` exactly once, after all iterations, `res` will contain all elements of `results` printed in the order they were computed.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `res` will hold each value from the `results` list in sequence, as each value in `results` is printed exactly once during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the hidden array `n`, extracts a list of `n` integers `p`, calls another function `func_1(n, p)` to compute a result, and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the computed results in the order they were computed.
