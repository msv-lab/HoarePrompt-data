Output State: **`j` is 2 * `n` + 1, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` is a list of 2 * `n` + 1 zeros, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to (`new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` to the result of `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Since `j` is defined as `2 * n + 1`, `j - 1` is `2 * n`. Given that `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` zeros, the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` before the update is `0`. After the update, `new_dp[j - 1]` becomes `(0 + dp[j]) % MOD`, which simplifies to `dp[j] % MOD`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
