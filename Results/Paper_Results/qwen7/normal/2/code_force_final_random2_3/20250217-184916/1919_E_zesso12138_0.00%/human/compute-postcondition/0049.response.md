Output State: **`j` is 2 * n, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to new_dp, and new_dp is a list of 2 * n + 1 zeros, `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. Since `dp[j]` is greater than 0 and `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` is now `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
