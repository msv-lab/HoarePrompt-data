Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`. This means that `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` will be equal to `2 * n`.
   - `n` will be at least 1.
   - `dp` will be equal to `new_dp`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to `n` (because the loop stops when `i` reaches `n`).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `j` will still be equal to `2 * n` because `j` is not modified within the loop.
   - `n` remains at least 1.
   - `dp` will still be equal to `new_dp` because `dp` is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `j` is equal to `2 * n`, `n` is at least 1, and `dp` is equal to `new_dp`.**
