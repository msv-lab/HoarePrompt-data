Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `data` is unchanged.
   - `index` is `index + n + 1`.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`data`, `index`, `p`, `result`, `results`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is `t - 1`**.
