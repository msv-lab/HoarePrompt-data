Output State: The final state of `dp` will be a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element `dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 \times n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`. This means that after all iterations of the loop, every element in `dp` will contain the cumulative sum of all previously non-zero elements in `dp` up to that index, taken modulo `MOD`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `dp` list will contain the total count of paths (or transitions) that can reach each index from the starting point, considering the constraints and operations defined within the loop. Each element in `dp` will reflect the accumulated sum of contributions from all previous indices that had non-zero values during the iterations, wrapped around using the modulo operation.
