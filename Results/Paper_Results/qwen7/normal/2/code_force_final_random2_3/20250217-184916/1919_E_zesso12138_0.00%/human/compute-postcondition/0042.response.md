Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i in range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` will be equal to `2 * n`
   - `n` will be at least 1
   - `dp` will be equal to `new_dp`

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `j` will still be equal to `2 * n` because it is not modified in the loop.
   - `n` remains at least 1.
   - `dp` will still be equal to `new_dp` because it is not modified in the loop.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is equal to `2 * n`, `n` is at least 1, and `dp` is equal to `new_dp`**.
