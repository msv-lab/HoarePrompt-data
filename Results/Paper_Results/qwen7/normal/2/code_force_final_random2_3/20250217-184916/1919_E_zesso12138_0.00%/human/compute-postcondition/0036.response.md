Output State: `res` is an element of `results` for each iteration of the loop, and since the loop prints each element of `results` exactly once, after all iterations, `res` will contain all elements of `results` printed in the order they were computed.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `res` will hold each value from the `results` list in sequence, as each value in `results` is printed exactly once during the loop's execution.
