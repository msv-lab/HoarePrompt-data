Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using spaces.**

This output state reflects that the `index` has been incremented by 1, and `t` has been assigned the value of the first element in the `data` list converted to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
