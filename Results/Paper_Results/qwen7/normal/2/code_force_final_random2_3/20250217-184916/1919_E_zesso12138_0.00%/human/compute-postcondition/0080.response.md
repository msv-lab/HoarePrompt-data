Output State: **`new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, all elements are 0, `i` is 2 * n + 1, `n` is at least 1, and `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, where each element `new_dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 * n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `new_dp` as a list of zeros with a length of `2 * n + 1`. This means that all elements in `new_dp` are set to 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Additionally, `dp` is set to be equal to `new_dp`, meaning `dp` now also contains a list of zeros with the same length.
