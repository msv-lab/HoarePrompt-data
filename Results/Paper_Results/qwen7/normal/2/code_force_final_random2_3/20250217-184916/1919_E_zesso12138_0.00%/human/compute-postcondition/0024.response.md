Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 2 * (n + 3)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index` and of length `n`.**

Explanation: The initial state includes `data` remaining unchanged, `index` being updated to `index + n + 3` by the first line of code, `t` being decremented by 1, and `p` being a list of integers from `data` starting at the updated `index` and of length `n`. The second line of code increments `index` by `n`, so the final value of `index` is `index + n + 3 + n`, which simplifies to `index + 2 * (n + 3)`. The other variables remain in their updated states from the first line of code.
