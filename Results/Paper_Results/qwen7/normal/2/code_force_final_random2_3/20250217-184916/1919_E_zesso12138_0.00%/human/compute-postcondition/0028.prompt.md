Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using spaces, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(n, p)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 2`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value obtained from `data[index]`, `results` now contains an extra element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 2 * (n + 3)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index` and of length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list to which the `result` has been appended.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
