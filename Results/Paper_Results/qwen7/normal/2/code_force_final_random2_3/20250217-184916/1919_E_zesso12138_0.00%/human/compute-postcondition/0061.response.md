Output State: **`j` is 2 * `n` + 1, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` is a list of 2 * `n` + 1 zeros.**

This means that after the loop terminates, `j` has incremented to `2 * n + 1`, which is outside the range of the loop condition (`j < 2 * n + 1`). The variable `n` remains at least 1, `dp` is still equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` zeros, as no changes were made to it within the loop.
