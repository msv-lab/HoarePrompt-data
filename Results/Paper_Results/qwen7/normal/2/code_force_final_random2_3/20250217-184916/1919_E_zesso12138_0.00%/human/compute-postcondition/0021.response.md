Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the integer value from `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value from `data[index]` to the variable `n`. The other variables (`data`, `index`, and `t`) remain unchanged. The new value of `index` is updated to `index + n + 2` and `t` is decreased by 1.
