Postcondition: `s` is a string, `i` is an index within the bounds of `s`, and `b` is a list. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[l]` where `l` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[r-1]`.
