You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.

    #State: Output State: The list `b` will contain all elements from the list `a` based on the instructions given by the string `s`. Specifically, for each 'L' in `s`, the corresponding element from `a` starting from index `l` (which starts at 0) will be appended to `b` and `l` will be incremented. For each 'R' in `s`, the corresponding element from `a` starting from index `r` (which starts at `n - 1`) will be appended to `b` and `r` will be decremented. After the loop completes, `b` will contain exactly `n` elements, and `l` will be equal to `n`, while `r` will be equal to `-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the final list `b` will be constructed by following the directions in string `s`, picking elements from the beginning or end of list `a` accordingly, until all elements of `a` are used, and both `l` and `r` will reflect their final positions after processing all elements of `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `p` will be equal to the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`, and `ans` will contain a list of `p` values after each iteration of the loop, starting from the first element of `b` up to the last element.
    #
    #In more detail, `p` will hold the cumulative product of all elements in the reversed list `b`. The list `ans` will contain each intermediate value of `p` as the loop progresses, with the final value of `p` being the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list of intermediate product values calculated during the loop, starting from the product of all elements in the reversed list `b` down to the product of the first element of `b`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program calculates the product of the array elements and takes the remainder modulo `m` at the beginning of each command execution, but it does not correctly handle the removal of elements from the array based on the command type ('L' or 'R').

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Array Removal:**
   - The program uses indices `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array, respectively. However, it incorrectly appends the elements from the array `a` to the list `b` based on the command type. For 'L', it should append the leftmost element and increment `l`, and for 'R', it should append the rightmost element and decrement `r`. Instead, the program appends elements from the list `b` which is being built, not from the original array `a`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Product:**
   - The program calculates the product of elements in the list `b` and appends the result to the list `ans`. However, this list `b` is not the correct representation of the array `a` after removing elements. The list `b` should be constructed by removing elements from `a` based on the commands, and then the product should be calculated for the remaining elements.

To fix the program, the following changes are needed:

- Correctly remove elements from the array `a` based on the command type ('L' or 'R').
- Calculate the product of the remaining elements and take the remainder modulo `m`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in b:
        p = (p * v) % m
        ans.append(p)
    return ans
```

This corrected version correctly removes elements from the array `a` based on the command type and calculates the product of the remaining elements, taking the remainder modulo `m` at each step.
