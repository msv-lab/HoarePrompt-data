Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same as before, `b` has a new element appended which is the value of `a[r]`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1, but its original value before decrementing is not specified. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and the appended element to `b`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
