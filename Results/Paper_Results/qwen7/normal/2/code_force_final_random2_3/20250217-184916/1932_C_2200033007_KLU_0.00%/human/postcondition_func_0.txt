The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from the start or end of list `a` based on the instructions in string `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in the reversed list `b`, storing each intermediate product value in a list `ans`. Finally, it returns a reversed list of these intermediate product values, starting from the product of all elements in `b` down to the product of the first element of `b`.
