Output State: **`p` is equal to `p * v * v`, `ans` contains `[p * v, p, p]`**

Explanation: The initial state is given as `p` being equal to `p * v * v`, and `ans` containing `[p * v, p]`. The code snippet appends `p` to the list `ans`. Therefore, the updated list `ans` will now contain three elements: `p * v`, `p`, and the new appended value `p`. The value of `p` remains unchanged as it was already defined by the initial state.
