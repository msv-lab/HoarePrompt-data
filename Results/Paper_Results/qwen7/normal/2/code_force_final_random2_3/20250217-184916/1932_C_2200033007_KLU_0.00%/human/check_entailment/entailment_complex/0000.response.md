Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function `func_1`.
2. The function processes the commands in the string `s` and constructs the list `b` by appending elements from the start or end of list `a` based on the instructions in `s`.
3. The function then calculates the cumulative product of the elements in the reversed list `b` and stores each intermediate product value in the list `ans`.
4. Finally, the function returns a reversed list of these intermediate product values, which matches the required output format.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required logic. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
