Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a reversed list of intermediate product values calculated during the loop, starting from the product of all elements in the reversed list `b` down to the product of the first element of `b`.**
