Output State: `p` will be equal to the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`, and `ans` will contain a list of `p` values after each iteration of the loop, starting from the first element of `b` up to the last element.

In more detail, `p` will hold the cumulative product of all elements in the reversed list `b`. The list `ans` will contain each intermediate value of `p` as the loop progresses, with the final value of `p` being the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order.
