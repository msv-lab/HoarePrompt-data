You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The list `b` will contain all elements from the list `a` based on the instructions given by the string `s`. Specifically, for each 'L' in `s`, the corresponding element from `a` starting from index `l` (which starts at 0) will be appended to `b` and `l` will be incremented. For each 'R' in `s`, the corresponding element from `a` starting from index `r` (which starts at `n - 1`) will be appended to `b` and `r` will be decremented. After the loop completes, `b` will contain exactly `n` elements, and `l` will be equal to `n`, while `r` will be equal to `-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the final list `b` will be constructed by following the directions in string `s`, picking elements from the beginning or end of list `a` accordingly, until all elements of `a` are used, and both `l` and `r` will reflect their final positions after processing all elements of `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `p` will be equal to the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`, and `ans` will contain a list of `p` values after each iteration of the loop, starting from the first element of `b` up to the last element.
    #
    #In more detail, `p` will hold the cumulative product of all elements in the reversed list `b`. The list `ans` will contain each intermediate value of `p` as the loop progresses, with the final value of `p` being the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list of intermediate product values calculated during the loop, starting from the product of all elements in the reversed list `b` down to the product of the first element of `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a reversed list of intermediate product values calculated during the loop, starting from the product of all elements in the reversed list `b` down to the product of the first element of `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a reversed list of intermediate product values calculated during the loop, starting from the product of all elements in the reversed list `b` down to the product of the first element of `b`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
