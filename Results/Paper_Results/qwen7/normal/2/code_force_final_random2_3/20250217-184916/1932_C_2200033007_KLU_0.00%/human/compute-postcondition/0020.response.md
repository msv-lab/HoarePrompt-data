Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same as before, `b` has a new element which is `a[l]`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[l])` appends the value of `a[l]` to the list `b`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a`, `l`, `b`, or `n`, the only change is that `b` gains a new element, which is `a[l]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
