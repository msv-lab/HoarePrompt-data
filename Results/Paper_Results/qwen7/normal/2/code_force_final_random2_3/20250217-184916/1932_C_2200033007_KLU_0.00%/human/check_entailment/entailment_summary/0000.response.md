Reasoning:
1. The program correctly processes the input and initializes variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`.
2. The function `func_1` constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from the start or end of list `a` based on the instructions in string `s`. However, the logic for constructing `b` seems incorrect because it appends elements based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R' instead of removing elements.
3. After constructing `b`, the program calculates the cumulative product of the elements in the reversed list `b` and stores each intermediate product value in a list `ans`.
4. The final step is to return a reversed list of these intermediate product values, which is incorrect because the problem requires printing the remainder of the product of all elements of the current state of the array `a` at the beginning of the execution of the i-th command.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the required logic. Specifically, it constructs `b` incorrectly and does not compute the required remainders at each step.

Correctness: **False**
