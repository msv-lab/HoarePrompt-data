Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not compute the product of the array elements modulo `m` before appending the result to the list `b`. Instead, it simply appends the values of `a[l]` or `a[r]` without performing any modulo operation. This results in incorrect outputs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Compute the product of the remaining elements modulo m
        for j in range(i):
            product = (product * a[j]) % m
        # Append the product modulo m
        b.append(product)
        # Process the command
        if s[i] == 'L':
            del a[0]
        else:
            del a[-1]
    return b
```

This corrected version ensures that the product of the remaining elements is computed modulo `m` at each step and then appended to the list `b`.
