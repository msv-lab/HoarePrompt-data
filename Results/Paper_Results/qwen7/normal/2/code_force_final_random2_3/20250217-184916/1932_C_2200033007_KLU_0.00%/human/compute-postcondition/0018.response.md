Postcondition: `s` is a string, `i` is an index within the bounds of `s`, `b` is a list. If the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[l+1]` and `l` is increased by 1. If the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is not 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[r-1]` and `r` is decremented by 1.
