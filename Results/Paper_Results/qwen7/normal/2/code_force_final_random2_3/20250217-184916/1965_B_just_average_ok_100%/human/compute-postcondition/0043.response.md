Output State: **We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `i` is either `idx + 2` where `idx` is `i - 1`, or `i` remains unchanged and we do not break out of the loop or if statement because `nums[i] <= k`.**

In this case, the `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. The values of `i` and `idx` remain as per their initial conditions unless specified otherwise within the loop or conditional block, which is not the case here. Therefore, the output state reflects that we have broken out of the loop or if statement, and the values of `i` and `idx` remain as described in the initial state.
