Output State: **`i` is 0, `idx` is -1, `nums` is a list with elements [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The line `idx = i - 1` assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `idx` becomes -1. The values of `nums`, `n`, `k`, and the condition that `nums[i]` is greater than `k` remain unchanged.
