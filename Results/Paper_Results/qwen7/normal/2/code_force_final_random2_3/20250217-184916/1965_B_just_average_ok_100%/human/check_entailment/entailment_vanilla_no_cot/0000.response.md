Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Bit Manipulation**: The line `nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]` creates a list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\). This approach is problematic because it doesn't ensure that the sequence meets the required conditions for all values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Subsequence Conditions**: The logic to generate the sequence `nums` does not guarantee that:
   - No subsequence sums to `k`.
   - All other values from 1 to `n` (except `k`) have a subsequence that sums to them.

3. **Handling Different Values of `n` and `k`**: The current implementation does not handle different values of `n` and `k` correctly. It assumes a fixed pattern which may not work for all cases.

4. **Removing Elements**: The removal of an element using `nums.remove(1 << idx)` is unnecessary and incorrect for generating the required sequence.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to construct a sequence that avoids having any subsequence sum to `k` while ensuring all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) are possible.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        # Create a sequence that avoids k and ensures all other sums are possible
        nums = []
        for i in range(1, k):
            nums.append(i)
        for i in range(k + 1, min(n + 1, 25)):
            nums.append(i)
        # Ensure the sequence length is at most 25
        if len(nums) > 25:
            nums = nums[:25]
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

func()
```

This approach ensures:
- No subsequence sums to `k`.
- All other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) are possible through subsequences.

This should correctly solve the problem for the given constraints.
