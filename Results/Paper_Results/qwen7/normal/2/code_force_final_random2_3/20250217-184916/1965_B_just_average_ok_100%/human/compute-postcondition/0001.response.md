Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n` is the first number entered by the user and `k` is the second number entered by the user, both converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into integers. It assigns the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
