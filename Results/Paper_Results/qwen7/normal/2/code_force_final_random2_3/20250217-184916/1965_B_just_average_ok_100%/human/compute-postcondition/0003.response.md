Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first number entered by the user and `k` is the second number entered by the user, both converted to integers; `nums` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `idx` is -1.**

The code initializes `idx` to -1, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `nums`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
