Output State: **`i` is 2, `idx` is 1, `nums` is a list with an additional element which is `k - nums[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 1, the new element appended to `nums` is `k - nums[1]`. The values of `i` and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial state.
