Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 19, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194305]**.

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `idx` from the list `nums`. Since `idx` is 19, the element `1 << idx` which is `1 << 19` (which equals 524288) is removed from the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
