Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `i` is 2
   - `idx` is 1
   - `nums` is a list with elements `[2, k + 1]`

2. The `print` statement is `print(len(nums))`.

3. To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the length of the `nums` list.

4. The `nums` list is explicitly defined as `[2, k + 1]`. This means it contains two elements: `2` and `k + 1`.

5. The length of a list is simply the number of elements it contains. Since `nums` has two elements, its length is 2.

Therefore, the output of the `print(len(nums))` statement will be the length of the `nums` list, which is 2.

Output: **2**
