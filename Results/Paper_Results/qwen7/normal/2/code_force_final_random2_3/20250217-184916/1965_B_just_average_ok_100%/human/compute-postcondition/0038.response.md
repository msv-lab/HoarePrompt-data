Output State: **`i` is `idx + 1`; `idx` is `i - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `idx = i - 1` updates the value of `idx` to be `i - 1`. Since `i` was initially set to 1, `idx` becomes 0. The other variables (`n` and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `idx` and the unchanged values of `i`, `n`, and `nums`.
