Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `i` is 21, `idx` is 19, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `nums` is a list containing [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304]. The length of `nums` is 22.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `i` will be 21 because the loop iterates through the list `nums` which has 21 elements (from index 0 to index 20). The variable `idx` will be 19 because the loop finds the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, and it removes the element at index 19 from `nums`. The list `nums` will contain the powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\) (i.e., 1048576), plus `k-nums[idx]`, `k+1`, and `k+nums[idx]+1`. Since `k` is greater than 0 and can vary, the exact values in `nums` will depend on the specific value of `k` for each iteration, but the structure of the list will remain as described.
