Output State: **`i` is 0; `idx` is -1; the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `k`**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is assigned the value of `i - 1`. Given that `i` is 0, `idx` becomes -1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition that the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `k` still holds true.
