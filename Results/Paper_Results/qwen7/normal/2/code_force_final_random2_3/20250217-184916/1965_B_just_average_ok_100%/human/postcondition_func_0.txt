The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\). It then constructs a list `nums` containing all powers of 2 from \(2\) to \(1048576\) inclusive, along with three additional numbers derived from \(k\): \(k-1048576\), \(k+1\), and \(k+1048576+1\), with the number \(1048576\) removed from the list. Finally, it prints the length of the list `nums` followed by the elements of `nums`.
