Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 2
   - `idx` is 1
   - `nums` is a list with elements `[2, k + 1]`

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since we don't know the exact value of `int(input())`, we need to consider the general case where the loop can potentially execute again.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. However, since the loop head does not involve `i`, `idx`, or `nums`, these variables remain unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The variables `i`, `idx`, and `nums` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `idx` is 1, `nums` is a list with elements [2, k + 1]**
