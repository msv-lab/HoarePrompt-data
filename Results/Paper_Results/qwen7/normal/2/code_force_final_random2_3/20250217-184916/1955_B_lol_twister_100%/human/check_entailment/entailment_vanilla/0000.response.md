Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, `c`, and `d` of the progressive square.
   - It also reads the array `l` of length `n^2`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to check if the given array `l` can form a progressive square with the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - It calculates the minimum value `a` in the array `l`.
   - It then generates the expected progressive square values using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all positions `(k, h)` in the `n x n` matrix.
   - Both the generated list `li` and the input array `l` are sorted.
   - Finally, it checks if the sorted lists match and returns 'yes' or 'no' accordingly.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for generating the progressive square values is correct. The formula `a + k * c + d * h` ensures that each element in the matrix is uniquely determined by its position `(k, h)`.
   - Sorting both lists before comparison is necessary because the input array `l` may contain the elements in any order.
   - The function correctly identifies whether the input array can form the required progressive square.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the input constraints appropriately.
   - The function works correctly for all given examples in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can confirm that it correctly implements the logic to check if the given array can form a progressive square with the specified parameters.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
