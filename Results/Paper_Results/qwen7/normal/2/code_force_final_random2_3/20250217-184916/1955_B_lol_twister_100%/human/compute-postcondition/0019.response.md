Output State: **`li` is a list with three elements: `a + k * c + 2 * d`, `a + k * c + 2 * d`, and `a + k * c + 2 * d`, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `li.append(a + k * c + d * h)` appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` (which is `a + k * c + 2 * d` since `h` is 2) to the list `li`. Initially, `li` contains two elements both equal to `a + k * c + d * h` (or `a + k * c + 2 * d`). After appending, `li` will have three elements, all of which are `a + k * c + 2 * d`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
