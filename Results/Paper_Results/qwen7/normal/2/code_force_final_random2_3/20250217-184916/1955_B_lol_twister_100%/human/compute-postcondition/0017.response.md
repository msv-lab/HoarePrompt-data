Output State: **`li` is a list with two elements: `a + k * c + d * h` and `a + k * c + d * h`, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 1**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Since `li` initially contained one element `a + k * c + d * h`, after appending the same value, `li` now contains two identical elements. The value of `n` and `h` remain unchanged.
