Output State: **`li` is a list with one element which is `a + k * c + d * h`, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 0.**

Explanation: The line of code appends the value of `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Since `h` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a + k * c`. The values of `n` and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states.
