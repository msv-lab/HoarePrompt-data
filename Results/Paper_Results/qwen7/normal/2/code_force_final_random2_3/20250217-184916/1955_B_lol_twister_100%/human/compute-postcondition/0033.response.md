Output State: **`k` is 499, `n` is 500, `h` is 499, `li` is a sorted list of 500,000 elements.**

Explanation:
- The initial state of `k`, `n`, and `h` remains unchanged as the sorting operation does not affect these variables.
- The list `li` initially contains 250,000 elements calculated using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` with `k` ranging from 0 to 499 and `h` ranging from 0 to 499 for the first 250,000 elements, and then `k` resets to 0 and `h` continues from 500 to 999 for the next 250,000 elements.
- After executing `li.sort()`, the list `li` is sorted in ascending order. However, since the exact values of `a`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact sorted values of the elements in `li`. The important point is that the list now contains 500,000 elements (250,000 from the first range and 250,000 from the second range), and they are sorted in ascending order.
