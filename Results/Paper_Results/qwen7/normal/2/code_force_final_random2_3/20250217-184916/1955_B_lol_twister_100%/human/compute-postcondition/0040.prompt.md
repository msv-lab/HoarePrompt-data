You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, c and d are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and l is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 ≤ l[i] ≤ 10^9 for all i.
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: Output State: `k` is 499, `n` is 500, `h` is 499, and `li` is a list of 250,000 elements. Each element in `li` is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `k` ranges from 0 to 499 and `h` ranges from 0 to 499 for the first 250,000 elements, and then `k` resets to 0 and `h` continues from 500 to 999 for the next 250,000 elements.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `k` will be 499, `n` will still be 500, and `h` will be 499 because the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`. The list `li` will contain 250,000 elements. For the first 250,000 elements, each element is the value of the expression `a + k * c + d * h` with `k` ranging from 0 to 499 and `h` ranging from 0 to 499. For the next 250,000 elements, `k` resets to 0 and `h` continues from 500 to 999, maintaining the same expression.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns 'yes'
    #State: `k` is 499, `n` is 500, `h` is 499, `li` is a sorted list of 500,000 elements, and `li` is not equal to `l`
    return 'no'
    #The program returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500), two integers `c` and `d` (where 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6), and a list `l` of n^2 integers (where 1 ≤ l[i] ≤ 10^9 for all i). It returns 'yes' in Case_1 and 'no' in Case_2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'yes'

Case_2: The program returns 'no'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
