Output State: `k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 299 (or the maximum value of `h` which is `n-1`), `li` is a list containing 500 elements, each element being the value `a + k * c + d * h` where `h` ranges from 0 to 499.

In this final state, the variable `k` remains unchanged at 0 because it is not modified within the loop. The variable `n` also remains unchanged as it is only used to determine the number of iterations. The variable `h` will be equal to `n - 1`, which is 499 in this case, since the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`. The list `li` will contain 500 elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for every integer value of `h` from 0 to 499.
