Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `h` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `h` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 0
   - `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive
   - `h` is 1
   - `li` is a list containing the value `a + k * c + d * 1` and the appended value `a + k * c + d * h`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `h` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `h` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `h` should be incremented to 2.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `k` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `n` remains unchanged (it must still be between 2 and 500 inclusive).
   - `h` is incremented to 2.
   - `li` will now contain the values `a + k * c + d * 1` and `a + k * c + d * 2`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 2, `li` is a list containing the value `a + k * c + d * 1` and the appended value `a + k * c + d * 2`**
