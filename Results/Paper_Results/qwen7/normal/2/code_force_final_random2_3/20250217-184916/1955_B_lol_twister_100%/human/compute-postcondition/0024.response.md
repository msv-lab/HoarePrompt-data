Output State: **`li` has a new element which is the value of `a + k * c + d * h`, and the values of `a`, `k`, `c`, `d`, and `h` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of the expression `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. The values of `a`, `k`, `c`, `d`, and `h` are used to compute the new element added to the list, but their individual values remain unchanged.
