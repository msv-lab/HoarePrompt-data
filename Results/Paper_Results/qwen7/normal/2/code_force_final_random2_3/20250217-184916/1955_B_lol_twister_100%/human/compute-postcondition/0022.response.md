Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for k in range(0, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `li` contains 500 elements.
   - `n` is 500.
   - `h` ranges from 0 to 499.
   - Both `k` and `d` retain their initial values.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `k < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` would have been one less than `n` because the loop increments `k` at each iteration.

4. **Calculate the new value of `k`**:
   - Since `n` is 500, and `k` was incremented in the previous iteration, the new value of `k` will be `500 - 1 = 499`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - The loop will continue if `k < n`.
   - With `k` being 499 and `n` being 500, the condition `k < n` is true.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `k` will be updated to 499.
   - `n` remains unchanged at 500.
   - `h` and `d` retain their initial values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`li` contains 500 elements, each of which is equal to `a + k * c + 499 * d`, `n` is 500, `h` ranges from 0 to 499, `k` is 499, and `d` retains its initial value.**
