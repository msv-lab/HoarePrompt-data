Postcondition: `y` is equal to `i`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first `i` elements of `a[0]` and the `i-th` element of `a[1]`, `x` is equal to `i`, and the most internal loop or if statement has been broken out of. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is updated to include the `i+1-th` element of `a[0]` and the `i-th` element of `a[1]`.
