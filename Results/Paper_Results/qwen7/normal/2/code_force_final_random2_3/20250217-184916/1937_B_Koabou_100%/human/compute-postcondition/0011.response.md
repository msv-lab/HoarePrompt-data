Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `s`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, or `n`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The only change is the creation of the empty list `s`.
