Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `a`. This operation does not affect the value of `t` or the binary strings mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, `t` remains unchanged and still follows the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The list `a` is now an empty list.
