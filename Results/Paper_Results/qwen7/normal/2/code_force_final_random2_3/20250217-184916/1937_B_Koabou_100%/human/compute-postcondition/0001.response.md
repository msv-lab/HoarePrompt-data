Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an empty list; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` will hold the integer value entered by the user. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
