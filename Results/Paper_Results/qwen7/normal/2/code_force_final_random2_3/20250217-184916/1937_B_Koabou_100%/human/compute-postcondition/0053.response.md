Output State: **`y` is equal to `x`, `i` is `x + 2`, `t` is `x - (x + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `-1`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `x - i + 1`. Given that `i` is `x + 2`, substituting `i` into the equation gives `t = x - (x + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `-1`. The values of `y` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
