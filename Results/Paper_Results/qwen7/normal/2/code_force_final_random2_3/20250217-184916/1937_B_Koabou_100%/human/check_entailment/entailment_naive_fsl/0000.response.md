Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the lexicographically smallest path involves both rows being used efficiently. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographically Smallest Path:**
   - The program attempts to find the lexicographically smallest path by checking for specific conditions in the first loop. However, it does not consider all possible paths and their combinations to ensure the smallest string is found.
   - For example, consider the following input:
     ```
     2
     010
     101
     ```
     The correct lexicographically smallest path would be `000`, but the program might fail to identify this due to its limited approach.

2. **Path Count Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of paths yielding the smallest string incorrectly. It assumes a linear approach and does not account for all valid paths that could lead to the same smallest string.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- For the input:
  ```
  2
  010
  101
  ```
  The correct output should be:
  ```
  000
  2
  ```
  However, the program might produce an incorrect result because it does not explore all possible paths comprehensively.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
