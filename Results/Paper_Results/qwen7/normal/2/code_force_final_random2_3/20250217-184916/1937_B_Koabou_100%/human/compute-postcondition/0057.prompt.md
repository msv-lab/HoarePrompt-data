Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer, `n` is the length of the concatenated string formed by `a[0]` and `a[1]` minus one, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first `x + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the `x-th` element of `a[1]`, `x` is the last index `i` that satisfied either of the conditions in the loop, and `y` is equal to `x`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(y, x):
    if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
        t = x - i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `y` is equal to `x`, `t` is equal to `x - i + 1`. The subarray `a[1][i:x]` is equal to the subarray `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, and the current value of `y` remains equal to `x`. If the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `y` is equal to `x`, `i` is `x + 1`, and `t` is either `-1` (if the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` is true and we break out of the loop or if statement) or `0` (if the condition is false and no change occurs).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `y` is equal to `x`, `i` is `x + 2`, and `t` is `-1` because the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` is true. If the condition is false, `t` remains `0`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
