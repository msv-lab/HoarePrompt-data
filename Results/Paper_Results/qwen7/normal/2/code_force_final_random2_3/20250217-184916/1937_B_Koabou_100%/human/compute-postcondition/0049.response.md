Output State: **`y` is equal to `x`, `i` is `x + 1`, `t` is `-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `y`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
