### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly reads the input for each test case, including the integer `n` and the two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
   - However, the function does not handle multiple test cases as indicated by the initial loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` outside of `func_1()`. Instead, it processes only one test case per call.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string `s` is flawed. The current implementation checks for specific conditions but does not ensure that the smallest possible string is generated.
   - The variable `x` is used to store the last index where a condition was met, but this does not necessarily lead to the smallest string. The approach should consider the entire path and not just specific indices.

3. **Counting Paths**:
   - The counting logic for the number of paths that yield the smallest string is also incorrect. The current implementation uses a fixed index `y` and `x` to count matches, which does not account for all possible paths leading to the smallest string.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints `s` and `t` directly, but `s` is not correctly constructed, and `t` is not calculated properly. This results in incorrect outputs for the given examples.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the path construction and counting logic, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
