Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be at least 2; `u` is an input integer; `v` is an input integer; `nodes[u]` now includes `v`.**

Explanation: The line `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list located at index `u` in the `nodes` list. Since `u` and `v` are both input integers, the value of `nodes[u]` is updated to include `v`. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged.
