Output State: **All keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1 in their associated list have been appended to the `leaves` list, `start` is an input integer, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`**.

Explanation: The code `moves = func_1(nodes, start)` calls the function `func_1` with `nodes` and `start` as arguments. The result of this function call is stored in the variable `moves`. The initial state mentions that all keys from the `nodes` dictionary with a length of 1 in their associated list have been appended to the `leaves` list, and `start` is an input integer. These conditions remain unchanged, and the new variable `moves` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`.
