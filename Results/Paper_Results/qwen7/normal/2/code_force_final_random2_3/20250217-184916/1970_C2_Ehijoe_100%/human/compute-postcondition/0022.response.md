Output State: **`leaves` is a list containing the element `key`; `nodes` is a dictionary representing the tree structure with at least one key, and the length of the list associated with `key` in `nodes` is exactly 1; `key` is the key corresponding to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The line `leaves.append(key)` appends the value of `key` to the list `leaves`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `leaves` now contains `key`, and `nodes` and `key` retain their original properties.
