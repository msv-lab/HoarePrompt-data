### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the winner of a game played on a tree with \( n \) nodes over \( t \) rounds.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, and players take turns moving the stone to an unvisited neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The game is played optimally by both players.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if a player can make a move from a given starting node.
   - It returns `False` if the starting node has only one neighbor (which is the parent node).
   - Otherwise, it recursively checks all other neighbors and returns `True` if any of them allow a move.
   - The logic is correct for determining if a move is possible.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function sets up the tree structure and determines the starting node.
   - It then calls `func_1` to check if Ron can make a move from the starting node.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "Ron".
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "Hermione".
   - The setup and logic for handling the input and output are correct.

4. **Overall Program Flow:**
   - The program reads the input correctly and processes it through the defined functions.
   - The tree structure is built properly using adjacency lists.
   - The leaf nodes are identified correctly.
   - The decision-making logic in `func_2` is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) work as intended and handle the inputs and outputs appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
