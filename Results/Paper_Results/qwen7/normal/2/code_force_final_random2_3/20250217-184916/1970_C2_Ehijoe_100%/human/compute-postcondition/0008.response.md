Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `u` is an input integer.
   - `v` is an input integer.
   - `nodes[v]` now includes `u`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least 2.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 1 (since it is incremented by 1).
   - `n` must still be at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**.
