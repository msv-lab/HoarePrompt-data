Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the value `n - 1`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `u` is an input integer (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged)
   - `v` is an input integer (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged)
   - `nodes[v]` now includes `u` (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged)

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

- `i` is 2
- `n` must be at least 2

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2**
