Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not designed to determine the winner of the game based on the optimal strategy. Instead, it appears to be checking if a node has any inactive neighbors, which is not relevant to determining the winner of the game.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the game for each starting node and determine the winner based on the optimal strategy. The current implementation does not simulate the moves or determine the winner based on the game rules.

For example, consider a simple tree with 4 nodes (1, 2, 3, 4) and edges (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4). If the starting node is 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, and Hermione can then move it to node 4. Ron cannot move the stone from node 4, so Hermione wins this round. However, the current program does not simulate these moves and will incorrectly determine the winner.
