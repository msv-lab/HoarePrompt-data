Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, nodes[u] includes v**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Since `u` and `v` are input integers, their specific values are not known, but it is clear that `v` has been added to the list at index `u` in the `nodes` dictionary. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged.
