Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now includes `u`.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Since `u` and `v` are both input integers, their specific values are not known, but it is known that `nodes[v]` will include `u` after this operation. The other variables (`i`, `n`) remain unchanged.
