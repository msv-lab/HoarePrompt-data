Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
