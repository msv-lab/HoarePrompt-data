Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty input string, `l` is 0, `h` is 1, `j` is the first character of `a`**.

The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since `h` was initially 0, after executing this line, `h` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
