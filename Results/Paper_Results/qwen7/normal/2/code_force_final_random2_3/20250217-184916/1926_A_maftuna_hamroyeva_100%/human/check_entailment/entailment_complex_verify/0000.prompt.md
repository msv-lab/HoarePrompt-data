You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings across all test cases are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        h = 0
        
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, and for each iteration `i` from 0 to `t-1`, `a` is a string representing the input for that iteration, `l` is the total count of 'A' characters in `a`, and `h` is the count of all other characters in `a`. The final output of the program will be a sequence of 'A' or 'B' based on whether `l` (the count of 'A' characters) is greater than `h` (the count of non-'A' characters) for each string `a`. If `l` is greater than `h` for any string `a`, the corresponding output will be 'A'; otherwise, it will be 'B'.
    #
    #In summary, the final output state will consist of a series of 'A' or 'B' characters, one for each input string processed, determined by the comparison of the counts of 'A' and non-'A' characters in each string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, an input string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It counts the number of 'A' characters in each string and compares this count to the number of non-'A' characters. Based on this comparison, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters is greater, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function returns nothing but outputs a sequence of 'A' or 'B' characters, one for each input string processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints the character that appears most frequently. Given the constraints (strings of length 5), the program will always produce the correct output for the specified test cases. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the problem description.
