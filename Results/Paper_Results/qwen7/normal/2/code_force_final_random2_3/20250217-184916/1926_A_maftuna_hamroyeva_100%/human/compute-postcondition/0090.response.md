Functionality: **The function processes an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, an input string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It counts the number of 'A' characters in each string and compares this count to the number of non-'A' characters. Based on this comparison, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters is greater, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function returns nothing but outputs a sequence of 'A' or 'B' characters, one for each input string processed.**
