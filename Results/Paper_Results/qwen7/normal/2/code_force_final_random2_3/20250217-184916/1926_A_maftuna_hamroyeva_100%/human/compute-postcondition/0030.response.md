Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty input string, `l` is greater than or equal to the total number of non-'A' characters in `a`, `h` is the total number of non-'A' characters in `a`, and `j` is the last character of `a` after the loop has completed. If the number of 'A' characters (`l`) is greater than the number of non-'A' characters (`h`), then `l` remains greater than `h`; otherwise, `l` is at least equal to `h`.
