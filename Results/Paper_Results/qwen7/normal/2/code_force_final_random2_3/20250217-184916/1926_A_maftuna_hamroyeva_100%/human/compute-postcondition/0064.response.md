Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in a`. This means the loop variable `j` will take on each character of the string `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `a` is the input string.
   - `j` is the last character of the new `a`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `h` is 0.
   - `i` is `t`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will iterate over each character in the string `a`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `a` is not an empty string.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` should be a non-empty string because if `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - `j` is set to the last character of the new `a` after the loop starts, but before the first iteration, `j` should be the first character of the string `a` (since the loop will start iterating from the first character).
   - `l`, `h`, and `i` are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `a` must be a non-empty string and `j` must be the first character of the string `a`.

**State:**
**`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the first character of `a`, `l` is 0, `h` is 0, and `i` is `t`**
