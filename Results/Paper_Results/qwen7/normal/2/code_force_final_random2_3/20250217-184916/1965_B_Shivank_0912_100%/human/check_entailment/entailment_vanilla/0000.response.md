Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   
2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - A loop runs until `1 << (i + 1) > k`. This ensures that `i` is set to the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\).

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed with three specific values:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This value ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This value is included to ensure subsequences can sum to `k + 1`.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This value is included to ensure subsequences can sum to `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.

4. **Additional Values**:
   - The program appends powers of 2 (from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19`) to the sequence `ans`, excluding the power of 2 corresponding to `i`.

5. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is printed.
   - The sequence `ans` is printed.

### Verification Against Problem Constraints and Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
   - The value `k - (1 << i)` is included in the sequence. Any subsequence that includes this value will not sum to `k` because the remaining part of the subsequence would have to sum to a negative number, which is impossible.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
   - The sequence includes all powers of 2 from `1` to `1 << 19` (excluding one). These values allow constructing any sum from 1 to `n` except `k` by combining them appropriately.

3. **Sequence Length**:
   - The sequence length is at most 25, which satisfies the problem constraint.

### Conclusion:

The program constructs a sequence that meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
