Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`, where `i` is the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\), and `k` must be at least \(2^i\).
- `j` remains 0.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(20):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable is `j`.
- The loop runs from `0` to `19` (inclusive), meaning `j` can take values from `0` to `19`.

### Current Value of `j`
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `0`.

### Next Iteration
- For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `1`.
- Therefore, `j` will become `1`.

### Adjusted State
- The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we only need to adjust `j` for the next iteration.
- Since `j` was `0` and it will be incremented to `1`, the new state will be `j` is `1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]`, where `i` is the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\), and `k` must be at least \(2^i\); `j` is 1**.
