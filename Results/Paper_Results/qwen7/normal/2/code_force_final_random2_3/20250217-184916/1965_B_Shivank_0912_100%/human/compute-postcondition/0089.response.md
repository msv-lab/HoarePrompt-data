Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a list of integers based on the value of \( k \) and prints the length of this list followed by the list itself. The list contains specific values derived from \( k \) and powers of 2, ensuring it includes all integers from 1 to 1048575 * 2^19.**
