Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`.
2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is less than 20.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is 20.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `ans` contains the value 1048576.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `j < 20`, the loop will not execute if `j` is 20 because `20 < 20` is false.
   - Therefore, no change is needed for `j` since it cannot be incremented further within the loop.
   - `n` must remain greater than or equal to 0 as there is no operation changing its value.
   - `ans` remains 1048576 as there is no operation changing its value.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration (which won't actually occur because the condition is not met) would still be the same as the current state.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 20, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` contains the value 1048576**.
