Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`, `i` is the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\), and `k` must be at least \(2^i\)**.

Explanation: The code assigns a list to the variable `ans`. The first element of the list is `k - (1 << i)`, the second element is `k + 1`, and the third element is `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. Here, `i` is the highest power of 2 such that \(2^i \leq k\), and `k` must be at least \(2^i\). The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their previous state, and the new list `ans` is created with these values.
