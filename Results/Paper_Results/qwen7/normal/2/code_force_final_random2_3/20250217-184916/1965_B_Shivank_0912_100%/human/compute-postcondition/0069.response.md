Output State: **`ans` is `[1048575, 1048577, 1048607]`, `j` is `19`, `i` is `20`, `tc` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is `1048576`**.

Explanation: The code updates the list `ans` with new values based on the current values of `i` and `k`. Specifically, `ans` is set to `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`. Given that `i` is `20` and `k` is `1048576`, the calculations are as follows:

- `k - (1 << i)` becomes `1048576 - (1 << 20)`, which is `1048576 - 1048576 = 1048575`.
- `k + 1` is simply `1048577`.
- `k + 1 + (1 << i)` becomes `1048576 + 1 + (1 << 20)`, which is `1048577 + 1048576 = 1048607`.

All other variables (`j`, `tc`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
