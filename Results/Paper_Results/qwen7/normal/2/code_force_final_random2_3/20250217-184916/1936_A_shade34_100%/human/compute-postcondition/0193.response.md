Based on the initial state provided, we know that `n` must be greater than 0. However, the values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine their exact values.

Given this information, the print statement will output placeholders for these undefined variables.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2]**
