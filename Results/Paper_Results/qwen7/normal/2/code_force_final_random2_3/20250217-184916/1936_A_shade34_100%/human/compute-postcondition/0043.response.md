Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a new string from input, `pans` is a list containing the value of `n`, `mak` is equal to `i`, `<` if `s` is the string '<', otherwise `mak` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `mak` now holds the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
