Output State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is 2, `pans` is `[0, 1]`, `mak2` is `n-1`, the current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `n+1` times, and the condition `s == '<'` is true.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `pans`. Initially, `pans` is `[0]`. After appending `i`, `pans` becomes `[0, 1]`. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
