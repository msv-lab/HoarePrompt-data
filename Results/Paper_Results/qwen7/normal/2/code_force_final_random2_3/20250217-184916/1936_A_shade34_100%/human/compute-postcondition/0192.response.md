Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - From the given state before the loop, `i` is `n-1`.
   - We need to determine what `n` should be for the loop to execute.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(n)`, which means `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Initial Value of `i`**:
   - Given `i` is `n-1`, the loop will start with `i = n-1`.

5. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n` initially.
   - Since `i` starts as `n-1`, the loop will execute if `n-1 < n`, which is always true.
   - However, to ensure the loop starts, `n` must be at least 1 (since `i` starts at `n-1`).

6. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure `n` is at least 1.
   - The value of `i` (`n-1`) is already correct for the loop to start.

7. **Other Variables**:
   - `mak2`, `pans`, and `mak` are not part of the loop head, so their values do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**.
