Output State: **`mak` is `len(pans) - 1`, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `n` is an input integer, the current value of the input string is `<`, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values but ensures that all previously written output is flushed to the standard output. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
