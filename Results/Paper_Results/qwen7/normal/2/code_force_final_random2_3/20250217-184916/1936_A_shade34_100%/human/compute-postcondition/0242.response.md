Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(pans)`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mak` is `i`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `i` is `n`
   - `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive
   - `len(pans)` must be `n`
   - If the input string is `'>',` then `mak` remains unchanged.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(pans)`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(pans) - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n + 1`.
   - `len(pans)` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

5. **Post-Iteration States**:
   - `mak` remains unchanged (since the condition for `mak` is based on the input string, and no new input string is provided).
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `i` is now `n + 1`.
   - `pans` remains the same list.
   - `len(pans)` remains `n`.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

**State: **`mak` is `i`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, and `len(pans)` must be `n`**.
