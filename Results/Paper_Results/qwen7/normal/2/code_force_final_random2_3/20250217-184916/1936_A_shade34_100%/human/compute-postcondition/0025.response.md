Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is not explicitly stated, but it is used in the loop condition.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = n-1`, the loop will execute if `n-1 < n`, which is always true for positive integers.
   - Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `n-1`.
- `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
