Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (as specified in the range function `range(1, n)`).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(1, n):` to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range function `range(1, n)` generates numbers from 1 up to but not including `n`.
   - `i` is set to 1 at the start of the loop.

4. **Adjust the given states**:
   - `mak` is 0, which is not relevant to the loop execution.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), which is also not relevant to the loop execution.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
