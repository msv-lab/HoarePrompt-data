Based on the initial state provided, there are no explicit values or definitions for the variables `mak` and `i`. Therefore, we need to consider the values of these variables as they are referenced in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Given that `mak` and `i` are not defined with specific values in the initial state, we can only describe them in terms of their usage in the `print` statement.

Output: **'? [mak] [mak] [i] [i]'**
