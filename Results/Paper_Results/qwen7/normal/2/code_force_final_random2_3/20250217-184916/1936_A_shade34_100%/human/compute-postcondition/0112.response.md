Output State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `0`, `pans` is an empty list, `mak2` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, the current value of the input string is `<`, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `n` times.**

Explanation: The line `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously printed data is displayed immediately. Since no variables are modified by this line of code, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
