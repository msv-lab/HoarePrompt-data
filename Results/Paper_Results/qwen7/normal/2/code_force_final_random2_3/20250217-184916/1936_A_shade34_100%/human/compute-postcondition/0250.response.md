The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed content is actually displayed. Since no variables are modified, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **mak is n+1, n is greater than 0, i is n, pans is a list containing all the values of i from 0 to n-1 inclusive, and len(pans) must be n.**
