Output State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, `mak2` is `n-1`, the current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user (it could be either '<' or '=' for the next iteration), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`mak`, `i`, `pans`, `mak2`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
