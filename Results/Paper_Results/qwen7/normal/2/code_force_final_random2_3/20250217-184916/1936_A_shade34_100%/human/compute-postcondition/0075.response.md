Postcondition: **`mak` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed. If the input is '>', then `mak` becomes 2. Otherwise, the values of `mak`, `i`, `pans`, `mak2`, and whether `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed remain unchanged.**
