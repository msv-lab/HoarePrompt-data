Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `i` is `len(pans) - 2`.
   - `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`.
   - `mak2` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `len(pans) - 2` must be in the range `[1, n]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The string `'?'` will be printed first.
   - `mak` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `mak` is again explicitly given as 0.
   - `i` is defined as `len(pans) - 2`. Since `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, the length of `pans` is `n`. Therefore, `len(pans) - 2` simplifies to `n - 2`.

Given the above, we can substitute the values into the print statement:

Output: **'? 0 0 n-2 n-2'**
