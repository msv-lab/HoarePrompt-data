Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` remains unchanged, meaning it has a specific value from before the code snippet was executed.
- `i` is updated to `i + 1`, so `i` now holds the value it had previously plus one.
- `n` remains the same, meaning it retains its previous value.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Given this, the output will include:
- The string `'?'`
- The value of `mak` (which is unchanged from before)
- The value of `mak` again (repeated)
- The new value of `i` (which is the original value of `i` plus one)
- The new value of `i` (which is the original value of `i` plus one)

So, the output will be:
Output: **'? [mak] [mak] [i+1] [i+1]** (where `[mak]` is the unchanged value of `mak`, and `[i+1]` is the new value of `i` which is the original value of `i` plus one)**
