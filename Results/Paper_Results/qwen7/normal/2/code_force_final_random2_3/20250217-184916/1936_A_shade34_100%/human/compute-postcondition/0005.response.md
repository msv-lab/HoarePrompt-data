Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is actually displayed. However, since no output was generated before this line, and no variables are modified by this line, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
