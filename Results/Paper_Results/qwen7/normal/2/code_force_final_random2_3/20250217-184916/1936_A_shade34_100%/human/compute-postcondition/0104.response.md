Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `n` is an input integer, the current value of the input string is `<`, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` simply assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `mak` is now equal to `i`, which was previously equal to `n`. The rest of the variables and their states remain the same as the initial state.
