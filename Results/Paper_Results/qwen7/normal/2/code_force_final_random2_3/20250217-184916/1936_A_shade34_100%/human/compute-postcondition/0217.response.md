Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is defined as `i_prev + 2`.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `pans` is a list (though its contents are not specified).

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak` and `mak2` are not defined in the initial state, so they are undefined.
- `i` is `i_prev + 2`, but `i_prev` is not defined in the initial state, so `i` is also undefined.
- `mak2` is mentioned twice in the print statement, but it is not defined in the initial state.

Given this information, the output will include placeholders for these undefined variables.

Output: **'? undefined undefined i_prev+2 undefined'**
