Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive.
- `mak2` is `n-1`.
- `s` is an input from the user (either '<' or '=' for the next iteration).
- `n` must be at least 2.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Here's the breakdown of the values that will be printed:

- `'?'`: This is a literal string and will be printed as is.
- `mak`: The value of `mak` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `mak`: Again, the value is 0.
- `i`: The value of `i` is `n-1`.
- `i`: The value of `i` is also `n-1`.

So, the output will be:

Output: **'? 0 0 n-1 n-1'**
