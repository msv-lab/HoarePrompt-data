Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `mak` is the maximum value between `n-1` and 1, and `pans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `pans`. This does not affect the values of `mak2`, `i`, or `mak`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
