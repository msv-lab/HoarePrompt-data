Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `pans`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (since the range function starts from 1).
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n-1` to `0`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 1, we need to ensure that `len(pans)` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `pans` should be correctly initialized as a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`.
   - `i` should be set to 1.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `pans` must be a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`.
- `i` must be 1.
- `mak2` is not involved in the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0**.
