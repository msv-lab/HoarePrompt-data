Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than 0

We need to determine the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` that will be printed. However, the initial state does not provide explicit values or definitions for `mak` and `mak2`. Therefore, we can only describe these variables in terms of their potential values relative to `i`.

Given that `i` is `n-1` and `n > 0`, `i` must be a non-negative integer (since `n-1` would be at least 0 if `n` is 1).

Since no specific values or conditions for `mak` and `mak2` are given, we cannot determine their exact values. We can only say that they are variables that have been defined but whose values are not specified in the initial state.

Thus, the output will include the string `'?'`, followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` (which are the same since `mak2` is mentioned twice).

Output: **'? [mak] [mak2] n-1 [mak2]** (where `[mak]` and `[mak2]` are the values of the variables `mak` and `mak2`, respectively, and `n-1` is the value of `i` which is `n-1`)
