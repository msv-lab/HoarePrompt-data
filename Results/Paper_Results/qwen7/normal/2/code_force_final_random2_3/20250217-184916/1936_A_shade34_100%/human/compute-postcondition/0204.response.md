Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string input by the user. If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is equal to `i`, and `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. If `s` is not equal to '<' but is equal to '=', `pans` has appended the value of `i`. If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` remains unchanged.
