Output State: **`mak` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is equal to `i` (which is `n-1`), `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, and the standard output buffer is flushed.**

Explanation: The line `mak = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `mak`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `mak`, and `pans`) retain their previous values and conditions as specified in the initial state. The standard output buffer is also flushed as mentioned in the initial state.
