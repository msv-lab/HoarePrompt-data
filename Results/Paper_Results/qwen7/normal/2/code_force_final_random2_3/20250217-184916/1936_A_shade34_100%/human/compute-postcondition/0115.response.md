Output State: **`mak` is `0`, `i` is `0`, `pans` is an empty list, `mak2` is `n-1`, the current value of the input string `s` is `<`, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `n` times, and the condition `s == '<'` is true.**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is `0`) to `mak`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
