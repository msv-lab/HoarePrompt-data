Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `n` or `i`. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the console immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or their states are altered, the conditions and values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
