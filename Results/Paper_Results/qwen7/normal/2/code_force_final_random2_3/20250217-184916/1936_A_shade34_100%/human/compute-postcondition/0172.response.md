Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is at least 2. This is because the range function generates numbers starting from 1 up to but not including `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially `n-1`, for the loop to start executing, `i` should be less than `n`. However, since `i` is set to `n-1`, the loop will not start executing unless `n` is at least 2.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be at least 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, `mak2` is `n-1`, the current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user (it could be either '<' or '=' for the next iteration), `n` must be at least 2**
