Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[l] <= a[r]`, and `k >= a[l] * 2`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `r` is decremented by 1 if `a[r]` is 0; otherwise, `l` is incremented by 1. If `k < a[l] * 2`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k` or if `l == r`.
