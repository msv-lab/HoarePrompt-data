Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`; `l` is 2 (since it was incremented by 1 from its original value which was 1); `r` is either n - 2 or remains as it was; `sumk` is 0; `k` is greater than or equal to twice the current value of `a[r]`; `sunks` is 1.**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions and initial state.
