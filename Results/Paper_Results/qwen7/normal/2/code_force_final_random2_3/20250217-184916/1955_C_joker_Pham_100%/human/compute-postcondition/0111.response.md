Output State: **`k` is an integer, `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `sunks += 1` increments the value of `sunks` by 1. Since the initial state already mentions that `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `k` is an integer, and there is no further modification to these variables, the output state remains as described.
