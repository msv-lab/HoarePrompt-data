Output State: **`k` is an integer equal to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 twice, and `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`.**

Explanation: The code `sunks += 1` increments the value of `sunks` by 1. Since `sunks` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, it is now incremented by 1 again, making it incremented by 2 in total. The values of `k` and `a[r]` remain unchanged from their initial state.
