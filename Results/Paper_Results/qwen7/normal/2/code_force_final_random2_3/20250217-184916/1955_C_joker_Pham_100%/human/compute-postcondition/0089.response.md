Output State: **`sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is an integer equal to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `r` is decremented by 1 if `a[r]` is 0; `l` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the `continue` statement itself, the values of `sunks`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged from their previous states.
