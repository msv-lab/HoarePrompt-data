Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`; `l` is 2; `r` is either n - 2 or remains as it was; `sumk` is 1; `k` is greater than or equal to twice the current value of `a[r]`; if `a[l]` is not zero, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r] - 2 * a[l]`, and `a[l]` is decreased by the current value of `a[r]`. `sunks` is increased by 1.**

This means that the variable `sunks` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states, except for the potential update to `k` and `a[l]` if `a[l]` is not zero.
