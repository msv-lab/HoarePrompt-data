Output State: **`k` is an integer, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently inside. The values of `k`, `sunks`, and the condition involving `l` and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
