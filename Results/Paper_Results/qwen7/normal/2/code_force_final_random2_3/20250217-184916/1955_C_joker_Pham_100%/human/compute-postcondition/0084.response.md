Output State: **`k` is an integer equal to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 twice, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and r is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1, but its initial value was not specified. The other variables (`k`, `sunks`, and `a[r]`) retain their previous relationships and values as described in the initial state.
