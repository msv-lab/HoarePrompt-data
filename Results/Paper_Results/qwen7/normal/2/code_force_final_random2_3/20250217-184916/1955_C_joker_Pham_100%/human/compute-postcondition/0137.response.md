Output State: **`sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is an integer equal to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`. If `a[r]` is not zero, `r` is decremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `sunks` has been incremented by 1, `k` remains as `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` has been decreased by `a[l]`, and if `a[r]` is not zero, `r` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
