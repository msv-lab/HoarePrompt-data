Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; k is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; a is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the length of a is equal to n; l is 0; r is n - 1; sunks is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`; `l` is either 1 or 2; `r` is either n - 2 or n - 3; `sumk` is 1; `k` is either updated to `k - 2 * a[r] - 2 * a[l]` (if `a[l]` is not zero and `k` is greater than or equal to twice the current value of `a[r]` and `a[l]` is not zero) or `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]` (if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the current value of `a[r]` and `a[l]` is zero); `sumk` is incremented by 1 if `a[r]` is equal to half of `k`, otherwise `sumk` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and if `a[r] < a[l]` is true, then either `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2` and `r` is equal to its initial value minus 2, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and either `a[r]` is adjusted according to the condition `k >= a[r] * 2` (where `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `r` and `l` are updated accordingly), or the loop breaks due to `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k` or `l` being less than or equal to `r`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
