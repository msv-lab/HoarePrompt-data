Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`; `l` is either 1 or remains as it was; `r` is either n - 2 or remains as it was; `sumk` is 0; `k` is either updated to `k - 2 * a[l]` or remains unchanged; the current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
