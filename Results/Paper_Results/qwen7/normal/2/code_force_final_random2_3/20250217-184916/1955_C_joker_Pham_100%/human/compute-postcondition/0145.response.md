Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and either `a[r]` is adjusted according to the condition `k >= a[l] * 2`, where `sunks` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]` and `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, then `r` is decremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1, or if the condition `k >= a[l] * 2` is not met, then either `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `l` is less than or equal to `r` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
