Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 and its current value is 0; `a` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1; `sumk` is 0; the current value of `l` is equal to `r`; if the value of `k` is greater than or equal to the last element of the list `a`, then `sumk` is 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; if `l` is not equal to `r`, the most internal loop or if statement continues without changing `sumk`.
