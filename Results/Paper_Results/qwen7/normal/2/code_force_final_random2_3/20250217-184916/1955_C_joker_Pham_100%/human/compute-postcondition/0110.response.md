Output State: **`r` is equal to its initial value minus 2**

Explanation: The variable `r` was initially decreased by 1. The `continue` statement does not change the value of any variables or affect the state of the program beyond moving to the next iteration of a loop. Since no further changes are made to `r`, its value remains as it was after the initial decrement, which is its initial value minus 1, and then minus another 1 due to the `continue` statement not altering it further.
