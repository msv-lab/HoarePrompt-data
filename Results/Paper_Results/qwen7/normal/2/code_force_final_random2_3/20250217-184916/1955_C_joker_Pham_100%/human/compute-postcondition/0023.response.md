Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 and its current value is `k - 2*a[l]`; `a` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 2; `sumk` is 0; `sunks` is 1; the value of `l` is equal to `r`; `a[r]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was equal to `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
