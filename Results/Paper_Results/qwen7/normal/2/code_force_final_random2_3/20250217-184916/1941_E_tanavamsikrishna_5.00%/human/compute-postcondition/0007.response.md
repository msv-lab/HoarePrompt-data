Output State: **`total_costs` is a list containing one additional element which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]` starting from index 1 and going for `k` consecutive elements, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, and `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be at least 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of `k` consecutive elements starting from index `i` (which is initially 1) to the `total_costs` list. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The length condition `len(costs) - (k - 1) must be at least 1` ensures there are enough elements left in `costs` to form another sum of `k` consecutive elements. All other variables remain unchanged.
