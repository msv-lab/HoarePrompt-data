### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: `row` is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of river cells in a single row, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports.
2. **First Loop**: The first loop increments the first `d-1` elements of the `row` list by 1.
3. **Second Loop**: The second loop updates the remaining elements of the `row` list. For each element starting from index `d-1` to the end, the value is set to the minimum value of the subarray from `max(0, i - (d + 1))` to `i-1` plus the original value of the element plus 1.

The issue with `func_1` is that it does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Instead, it simply adds a fixed cost to each element based on the minimum value of the previous `d` elements, which does not guarantee the distance constraint.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: Reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and the depths of the river cells stored in `rows`.
2. **Cost Calculation**: Uses `func_1` to calculate the cost for each row and stores the results in `costs`.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: Iterates through the `costs` list and calculates the sum of every `k` consecutive elements, storing these sums in `total_costs`.
4. **Result**: Prints the minimum value among all the sums of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

The main issue here is that `func_1` does not correctly handle the distance constraint between supports. As a result, the `total_costs` list might contain incorrect values, leading to an incorrect minimum cost.

#### Correctness of the Program:
Given the analysis above, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges because `func_1` does not enforce the distance constraint between supports. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the distance constraint between supports, as demonstrated by the issues identified in the analysis.
