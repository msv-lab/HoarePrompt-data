Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Identify the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m`.

3. **Current values of the variables**:
   - `x` is 2
   - `y` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 5
   - `m` must be at least 30
   - `cnt` is 10 (this variable is not involved in the loop condition)

4. **Evaluate the loop condition with current values**:
   - Substitute the values into the loop condition:
     \[
     (x + y) * x \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (x + y) * y \leq m
     \]
     \[
     (2 + 1) * 2 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (2 + 1) * 1 \leq m
     \]
     \[
     3 * 2 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad 3 * 1 \leq m
     \]
     \[
     6 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad 3 \leq m
     \]

5. **Check the conditions**:
   - `6 \leq n`: This condition is already satisfied because `n` must be at least 5, and 6 is greater than 5.
   - `3 \leq m`: This condition is already satisfied because `m` must be at least 30, and 30 is greater than 3.

Since both conditions are already satisfied with the current values, no adjustments are needed to make the loop execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 1, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 30**
