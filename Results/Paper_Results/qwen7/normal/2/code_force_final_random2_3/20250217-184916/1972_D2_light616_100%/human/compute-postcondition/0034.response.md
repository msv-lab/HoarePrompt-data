To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head. The loop condition is:

\[
(x + y) * x \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (x + y) * y \leq m
\]

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 3
- `n` must be at least 5
- `m` must be at least 30
- `cnt` is 1

We need to check if these values satisfy the loop condition.

First, let's evaluate the expression `(x + y) * x`:
\[
(x + y) * x = (2 + 3) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10
\]
Since `n` must be at least 5, and 10 is indeed less than or equal to `n`, this part of the condition is satisfied.

Next, let's evaluate the expression `(x + y) * y`:
\[
(x + y) * y = (2 + 3) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15
\]
Since `m` must be at least 30, and 15 is not less than or equal to `m`, this part of the condition is not satisfied.

Therefore, the loop will not execute again because the second condition `(x + y) * y <= m` is not met.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the second condition is satisfied. This means `m` must be at least 15.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `m` must be at least 15

The final state should be:
State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 15, and `cnt` is 1**
