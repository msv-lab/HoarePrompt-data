Output State: `x` is greater than the square root of `n`, `y` is 5, `cnt` is 10, `n` must be at least 10, `m` must be at least 30.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `x` until `x * x > n`. From the given information, we know that after 3 iterations, `x` is 4 and `n` must be at least 27. Since `x` increments by 1 each iteration, it will continue to increase until `x * x` exceeds `n`. Given that `x` is 4 after 3 iterations and considering the condition `x * x <= n`, `x` must be incremented further until `x * x > n`. Therefore, `x` will be greater than the square root of `n` when the loop finishes. The value of `y` remains 5 as it is only incremented within the inner loop and does not reset. The value of `cnt` remains 10 as no additional terms are added once `x * x > n`. The constraints on `n` and `m` remain the same as they are conditions for the loop to start and do not change during its execution.
