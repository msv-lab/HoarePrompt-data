Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 5, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 15, and `cnt` is 6**.

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `y`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. Therefore, the updated state is `x` is 3, `y` is 5, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 15, and `cnt` is 6.
