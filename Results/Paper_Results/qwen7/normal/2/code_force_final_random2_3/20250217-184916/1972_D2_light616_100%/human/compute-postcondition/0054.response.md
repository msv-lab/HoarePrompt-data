Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Current values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is 3
   - `n` is at least 12
   - `y` is 3
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 10

3. **Evaluate the loop condition with current values**:
   - Substitute `x = 3` and `y = 3` into the condition:
     \[
     (3 + 3) * 3 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (3 + 3) * 3 \leq m
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     6 * 3 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad 6 * 3 \leq m
     \]
     Which further simplifies to:
     \[
     18 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad 18 \leq m
     \]

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
     - \(18 \leq n\)
     - \(18 \leq m\)

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `n` is already at least 12, it needs to be adjusted to be at least 18.
   - Similarly, `m` must be adjusted to be at least 18.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be at least 18
- `m` must be at least 18

State: **`x` is 3, `n` must be at least 18, `y` is 3, and `m` must be at least 18**
