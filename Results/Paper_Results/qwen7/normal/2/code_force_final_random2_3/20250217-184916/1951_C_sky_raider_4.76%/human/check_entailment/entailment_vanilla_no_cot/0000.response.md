Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Cost**: The variable `c` is being updated incorrectly. The formula `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` does not correctly represent the total cost of buying `s` tickets on day `i`. The term `s * s / 2` is subtracted, which is not relevant to the problem's constraints and logic.

2. **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list `l` before processing it is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The problem requires finding the minimum cost, but sorting the list does not help in achieving this goal directly.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Ticket Purchase**: The logic for purchasing tickets and updating the cost is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly handle the price increase after purchasing tickets on a particular day.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1

    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
        index += 3
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n

        # Initialize variables
        total_cost = 0
        remaining_tickets = k
        max_tickets_per_day = m

        for i in range(n):
            tickets_to_buy = min(max_tickets_per_day, remaining_tickets)
            remaining_tickets -= tickets_to_buy
            total_cost += tickets_to_buy * a[i]
            if remaining_tickets == 0:
                break
            max_tickets_per_day += tickets_to_buy

        results.append(total_cost)

    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Reading Input Efficiently**: The input is read efficiently using `sys.stdin.read` to handle large inputs.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the number of days (`n`), maximum tickets per day (`m`), and the number of tickets to buy (`k`) are read.
3. **Processing Prices**: The prices for each day are read and stored in the list `a`.
4. **Dynamic Ticket Purchase**: The algorithm iterates through each day, determining how many tickets to buy based on the remaining tickets needed and the maximum allowed per day. The cost is accumulated accordingly.
5. **Breaking Early**: If the required tickets are met, the loop breaks early to save computation time.

This approach ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly according to the problem constraints.
