Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, `l` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged. After sorting, the list `l` will contain its elements in non-decreasing order.
