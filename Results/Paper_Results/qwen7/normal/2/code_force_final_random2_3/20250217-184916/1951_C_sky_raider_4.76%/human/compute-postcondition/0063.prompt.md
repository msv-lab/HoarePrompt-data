Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9); a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    s = 0
    c = k * k / 2
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        k -= s
        c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is less than or equal to 0, `m` remains the same as the initial value, `s` remains the same as the initial value, and `l` remains the same as the initial sorted list of integers.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has executed `n` times. The variable `c` will hold the cumulative sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration. The variable `n` must still be greater than 0. The variable `k` will be reduced to 0 or a negative value due to the subtraction in the loop. Variables `m`, `s`, and the list `l` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the input integer `n`. The variable `c` will hold the cumulative sum of the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration of the loop, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at each step, and `k` decreases by the value of `s` with each iteration. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 ensures the loop runs at least once.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is `k - n * s`, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from 0 to `n-1`, `s` is `min(m, k)`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` (since the loop increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches `n`). The variable `k` will be reduced by `n * s` (where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` at the start of each iteration). The variable `c` will hold the cumulative sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `s` will be updated to the minimum of `m` and `k` at the start of each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
