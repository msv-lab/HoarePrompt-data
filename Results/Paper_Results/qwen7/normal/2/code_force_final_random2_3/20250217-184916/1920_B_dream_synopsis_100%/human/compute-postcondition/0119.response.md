Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `sums` remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` before being appended to `ans`.
