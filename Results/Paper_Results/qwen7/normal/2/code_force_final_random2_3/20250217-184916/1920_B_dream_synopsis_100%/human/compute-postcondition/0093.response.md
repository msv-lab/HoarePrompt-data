To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process step by step based on the initial state and the operations performed in the loop.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `k`.
   - `sums` is initially set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
   - `ans` is a list that will store the updated values of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each value of `i` from 0 to `k`:
     - If `i == 0`, `sums` is initialized to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
     - For subsequent values of `i`:
       - If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
       - Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value among all the values stored in the list `ans`.

Given this breakdown, the output will be the maximum value of the list `ans`, which contains the sequence of `sums` values calculated during each iteration of the loop.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list of length k+1 containing the sequence of sums values calculated during each iteration of the loop)**
