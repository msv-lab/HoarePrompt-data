Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` was initially set to 0 and remains unchanged. The variable `k` is mentioned to be a non-negative integer, which also remains unchanged. The new variable `sums` is assigned the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Here, `a[:x]` refers to the slice of list `a` up to index `x`, and `sum(a[:x])` calculates the sum of these elements. The value of `sums` is dependent on the values of `sum1` and the sum of the slice `a[:x]`.
