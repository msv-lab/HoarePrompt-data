Output State: **`i` is 0, `sums` is the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `ans` is an empty list, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and reversed, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` to be `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Here, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, which remains unchanged. `a[:x]` is the slice of the list `a` up to index `x`, and `sum(a[:x])` calculates the sum of these elements. The value of `sums` is thus calculated as specified, while other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.
