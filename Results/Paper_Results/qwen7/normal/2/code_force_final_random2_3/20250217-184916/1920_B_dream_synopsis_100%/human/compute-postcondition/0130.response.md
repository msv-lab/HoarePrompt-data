Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list with one element equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(ans[:x])`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(ans[:x])`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(ans[:x])`. Since `x` is an integer and initially `ans` is a list with one element (which is 0 because no elements were appended before), the expression simplifies to `sum1 - 2 * 0 = sum1`. Therefore, `ans` now contains one element which is `sum1`.
