Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` remains unchanged, `sums` is updated according to the condition `i + x - 1 < n`. If the condition is met, `sums` is either `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` or `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` if the condition is met, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged and is appended with the value of `sums`.
