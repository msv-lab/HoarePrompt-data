Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i == 0`, otherwise updated based on the conditions, `ans` is equal to the initial value of `sums`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated as follows:
- If `i` is equal to 0, then `ans` contains `sums` which is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- If `i` is not equal to 0, then `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list. If `i == 0`, then `ans` contains the value of `sums` updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `ans` contains the value of `sums` updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, then `ans` contains the value of `sums` updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list. If `i == 0`, then `ans` contains `[sum1 - 2 * sum(ans[:x])]` and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(ans[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `ans` contains `[a[0] - 2 * a[x]]` and `sums` is `a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. Otherwise, `ans` contains `[a[0]]` and `sums` is `a[0]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
