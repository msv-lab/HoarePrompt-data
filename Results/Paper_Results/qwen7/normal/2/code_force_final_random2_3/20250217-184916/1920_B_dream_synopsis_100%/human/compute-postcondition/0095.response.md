Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i == 0`, otherwise updated based on the conditions, `ans` is equal to the initial value of `sums`.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 1. The variables `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input, while `sums` and `ans` remain as per their initial definitions, with `ans` being equal to the initial value of `sums`.
