Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to it. Since `i` is 0, `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[-1]`, which is undefined in a typical list context unless explicitly defined. However, since the problem does not specify the behavior for such cases, we assume it remains undefined or not used. The key point is that `i + x - 1` must be less than `n` for the index to be valid, and this condition is preserved. The value of `k` and the inequality involving `i` remain unchanged.
