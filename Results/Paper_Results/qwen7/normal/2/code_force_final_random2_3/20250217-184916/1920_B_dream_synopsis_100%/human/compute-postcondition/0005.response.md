Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `n`, `k`, and `x` are their respective integer values from the input split by spaces, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `sum1`. Since `a` is initially a sorted list of integers in reverse order, its elements remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are also not affected by this operation. Therefore, `sum1` now holds the sum of all elements in `a`.
