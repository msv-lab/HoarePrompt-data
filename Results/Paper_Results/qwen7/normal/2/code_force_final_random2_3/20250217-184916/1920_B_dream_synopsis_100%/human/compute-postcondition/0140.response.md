Output State: The loop will execute `k + 1` times. After all iterations, `i` will be `k + 1`, `x` will remain an integer, and `n` will remain an integer. The variable `ans` will be a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` will be calculated based on the conditions within the loop:

- If `i == 0`, the first element in `ans` will be `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- For subsequent elements (when `i > 0`), the value of `sums` will be updated as follows:
  - If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` will be updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
  - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` will be updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

Each updated value of `sums` will be appended to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will contain the sequence of `sums` values computed through each iteration of the loop.

In summary, `ans` will be a list of length `k + 1` with each element representing the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop, starting from the initial computation when `i == 0` and updating according to the given conditions for subsequent iterations.
