Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `i`, `k`, `sums`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
