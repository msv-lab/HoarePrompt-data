Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[1]`, `ans` depends on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`**

Explanation: The code updates `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing `sums = sums + a[i - 1]`, `i` becomes 2 (since `i` is incremented implicitly by the operation). The value of `sums` is now `sums + a[1]`. The values of `k` and `ans` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
