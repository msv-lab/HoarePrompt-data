Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated accordingly based on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is 1, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`. If `i` is 2, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`. `ans` is a list that either contains one element which is `sums` (when `i` is 1) or contains the value of `sums` appended to it (when `i` is 2).
