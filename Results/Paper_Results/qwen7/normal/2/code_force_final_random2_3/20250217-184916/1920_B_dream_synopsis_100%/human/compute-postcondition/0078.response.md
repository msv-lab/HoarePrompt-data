Postcondition: **`sums` is updated based on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`. If the condition is true, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If the condition is false, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` remains within the range `[0, k-1]`, `sum1` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` now includes the new value of `sums` if the condition is true, or the old value of `sums` if the condition is false, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.**
