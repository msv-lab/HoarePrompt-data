Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i == 0`, otherwise updated based on the conditions, `ans` is equal to the initial value of `sums`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sums`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
