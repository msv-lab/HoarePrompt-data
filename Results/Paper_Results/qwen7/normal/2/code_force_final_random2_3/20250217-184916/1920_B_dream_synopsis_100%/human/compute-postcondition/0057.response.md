Output State: **`i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`, `sums` is the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and reversed, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `ans` was initially an empty list. After appending, `ans` contains one element, which is `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
