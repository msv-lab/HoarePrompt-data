Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the input split by spaces, `n`, `k`, and `x` are their respective integer values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation. The initial state of `a` being a list of integers from the input split by spaces remains valid, but now `a` is sorted.
