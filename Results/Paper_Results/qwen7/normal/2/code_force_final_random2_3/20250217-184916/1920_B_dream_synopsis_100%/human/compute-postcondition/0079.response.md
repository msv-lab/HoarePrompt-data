Postcondition: **`i` is within the range `[0, k-1]`, `sums` is updated based on the following conditions: if `i == 0`, `sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `ans` now includes the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` includes the new value of `sums`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` includes the old value of `sums`. `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `a` and `sum1` remain unchanged.**
