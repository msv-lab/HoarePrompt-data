Output State: **`i` is within the range [1, k], `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` includes the updated value of `sums`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same, and `a` and `sum1` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This does not change the values of `i`, `sums`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `sum1`. It only adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Therefore, the ranges and relationships of the other variables remain the same as the initial state.
