Output State: **`i` is within the range [0, k]; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`; `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and reversed; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `i` is not equal to 0; `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty list, after executing this line, `ans` will contain one element, which is the current value of `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
