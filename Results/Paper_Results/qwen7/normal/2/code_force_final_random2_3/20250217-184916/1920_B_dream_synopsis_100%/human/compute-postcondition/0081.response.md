Output State: **`sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `i` is within the range [1, k], `ans` includes the updated value of `sums` if the conditions are met, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same, and `a` and `sum1` remain unchanged.**

This means that the value of `sums` has been updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1`) retain their previous states.
