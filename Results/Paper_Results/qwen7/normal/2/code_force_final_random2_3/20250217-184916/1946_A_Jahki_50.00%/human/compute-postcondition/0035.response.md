Output State: `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is the number of iterations it took to reach the point where `new_median` becomes the maximum value in `b`, `b` is a sorted list of integers starting from 1 up to the maximum value in `a`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment the middle value (`b[ma]`) and increase the operation count (`op`) until the new median (`new_median`) becomes the highest value in the list `b`. Since `b` is initially a sorted list of integers derived from the input string `case`, and the loop increments the middle value repeatedly, eventually, the middle value will become the largest possible value in the list, which is the maximum value in the original list `a`. At this point, the condition `new_median <= median` will no longer hold true, and the loop will terminate.
