Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `num` is the same as the initial or previous state, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `median` is `b[ma]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the median of the list `b` using the index `ma`. Since `ma` is defined as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `num2 / 2` if `num2` is odd, the value of `median` is set to the element at this index in the list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
