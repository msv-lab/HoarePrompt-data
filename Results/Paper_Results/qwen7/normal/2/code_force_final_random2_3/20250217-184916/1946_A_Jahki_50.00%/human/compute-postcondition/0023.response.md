Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is less than `median`, `op` is 1, `b` is a sorted list of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b`. However, since `b` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its contents after sorting. All other variables (`total`, `students`, `new_median`, and `op`) remain unchanged.
