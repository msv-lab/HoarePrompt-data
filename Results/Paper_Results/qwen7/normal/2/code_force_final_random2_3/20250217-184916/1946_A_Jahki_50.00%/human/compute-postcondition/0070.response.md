Based on the initial state described, the `op` variable represents the total number of iterations the loop executed. The loop continues to increment `ma` and increase the count in `b[ma]` until `new_median` becomes greater than `median`. 

Since the exact number of iterations is not specified, we can only refer to `op` as the total number of iterations that occurred during the execution of the loop.

Output: **op (where op is the total number of iterations the loop executed)**
