The only variable in the loop head is `new_median`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `new_median`. If `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, and `median` must be greater than `b[ma]`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `new_median` must be greater than `median`.

State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` must be greater than `median`, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted list of `b`, and `median` must be greater than `b[ma]`**
