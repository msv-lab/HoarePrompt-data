Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma] + 1`, `op` is 1, `b` is a sorted list of `b`, and `median` must be greater than `b[ma] + 1**.

Explanation: The code `b[ma] += 1` increments the value of `b[ma]` by 1. Since `new_median` was previously equal to `b[ma]`, it now becomes equal to `b[ma] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
