Output State: **`b` is sorted, `ma` is incremented by 1, `op` is increased by 1, `new_median` is equal to the value at index `ma-1` of list `b` and `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`, `b[ma]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[ma] += 1` increments the value at index `ma` of list `b` by 1. Since `ma` was previously incremented by 1, the new value at index `ma-1` (which was the original `ma`) is now `new_median`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for the updated value at index `ma-1` in list `b`.
