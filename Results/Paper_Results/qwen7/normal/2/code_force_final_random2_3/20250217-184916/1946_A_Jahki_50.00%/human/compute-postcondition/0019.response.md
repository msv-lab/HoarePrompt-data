The code `new_median = median` assigns the value of `median` to `new_median`. Since `median` is defined as `b[ma]` where `ma` is calculated based on `num2`, the value of `new_median` will be the same as `median`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`case` is a string input from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer less than or equal to 10000, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `a`, `median` is `b[ma]` where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 / 2`, `new_median` is equal to `median`.**
