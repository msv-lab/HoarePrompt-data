Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    op = 0
    if num2 > 10000:
        print(1)
        print(16668)
        break
    else:
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
        median = b[ma]
        new_median = median
        while new_median <= median:
            b[ma] += 1
            op += 1
            b = sorted(b)
            new_median = b[ma]
        print(op)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `case` is a string input from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer. If `num2` is greater than 10000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is the number of iterations it took for `new_median` to become greater than `median`, and `b` is a sorted list of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is 0, and `b` is a sorted list of integers. If `num2` is greater than 10000, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues to increment `ma` and increase the count in `b[ma]` until `new_median` becomes greater than `median`. After all iterations, the final state will be: `b` is a sorted list of integers, `ma` is the last index where `new_median` was updated, `op` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `new_median` is the value at index `ma` of list `b`, and `b[ma]` is the count of the median value in the list `b`. All other variables (`case`, `t`, `i`, `num2`, `total`, `students`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `case` is an updated input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 5, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the updated median after all increments, `op` is the total number of operations performed, `b` is a sorted list of integers where each element has been incremented by 1 starting from the middle index `ma` until `new_median` exceeds `median`, and `median` is the original median before any increments.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
