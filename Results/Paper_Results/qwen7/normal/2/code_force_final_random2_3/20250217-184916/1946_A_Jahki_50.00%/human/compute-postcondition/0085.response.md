Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is equal to `median`, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `num` is the same as the initial or previous state, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `median` is `b[ma]`**.

Explanation: The line `new_median = median` assigns the value of `median` to `new_median`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
