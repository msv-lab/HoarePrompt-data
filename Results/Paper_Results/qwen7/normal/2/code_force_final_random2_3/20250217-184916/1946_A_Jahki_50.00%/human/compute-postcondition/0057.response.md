Output State: **`b` is sorted, `ma` is incremented by 1, `op` is increased by 1, `new_median` is equal to the value at index `ma` of list `b`**.

This means that the new variable `new_median` is assigned the value of the element at the index `ma` in the list `b`. The other variables `b`, `ma`, and `op` retain their previous states with `ma` incremented by 1 and `op` increased by 1.
