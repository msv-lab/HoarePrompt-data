Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `new_median <= median`.
2. **Identify the relevant variables**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `new_median` and `median`.

Given the initial state:
- `case` is an input string from the user.
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- `i` is 2.
- `num2` is an integer input from the user.
- `total` is 0.
- `students` is 1.
- `new_median` is equal to `median`.
- `op` is 0.
- `b` is a sorted list of integers.
- `num` is the same as the initial or previous state.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer.
- `b` is a sorted version of `a`.
- `median` is `b[ma]`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, the condition `new_median <= median` must be true.

Since `new_median` is initially equal to `median`, the loop will not execute at all unless `new_median` is modified to be less than or equal to `median`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `new_median` to be less than or equal to `median`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `num` is the same as the initial or previous state, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `median` is `b[ma]`**
