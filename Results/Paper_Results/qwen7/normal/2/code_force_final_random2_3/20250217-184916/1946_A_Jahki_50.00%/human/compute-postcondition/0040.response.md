Output State: **`case` is a string input from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer input from the user, otherwise `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is the number of iterations it took for `new_median` to become greater than `median`, and `b` is a sorted list of `a**.

In this output state, the variable `num2` is assigned the value of the integer input from the user, while all other variables retain their previous states.
