Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is 0, and `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]` splits the string `case` into substrings using whitespace as the delimiter and then converts each digit substring to an integer, adding it to the list `a`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 because the code is part of a loop or conditional block that was previously affecting `i`, making it 2 now. All other variables remain unchanged.
