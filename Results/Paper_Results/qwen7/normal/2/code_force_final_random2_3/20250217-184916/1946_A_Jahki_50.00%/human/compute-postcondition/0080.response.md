Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `num` is the same as the initial or previous state, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a sorted version of `a`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `a` and assigns the sorted list to `b`. The sorting operation does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged. The list `b` now contains the sorted integers from the list `a`.
