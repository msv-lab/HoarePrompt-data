### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`) and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`num2`) and the array itself (`case`).

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program includes an edge case check where if `num2` exceeds 10000, it prints `1` and `16668` and breaks the loop. However, this check is not relevant to the problem statement, which specifies `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`. Therefore, this part is unnecessary and should be removed.

3. **Array Processing**:
   - The array `a` is correctly parsed from the input string `case`.
   - The array `b` is sorted to find the median.
   - The median is calculated correctly based on whether the array size is even or odd.

4. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median calculation is done correctly using the formula for the middle index.
   - The program then enters a loop to increment elements until the median increases, counting the number of operations.

5. **Sorting and Increment Loop**:
   - The loop increments the element at the median index and re-sorts the array to check the new median.
   - This process continues until the new median is greater than the old median.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of operations required to increase the median.

### Conclusion:

The program logic appears to be correct for the given problem statement. The only issue is the unnecessary edge case check that should be removed. After removing this check, the program should work as expected.

### Correctness:
