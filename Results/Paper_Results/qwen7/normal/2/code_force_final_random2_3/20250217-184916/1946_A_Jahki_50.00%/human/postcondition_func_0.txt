The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `num2` and a list of integers `case`. If `num2` exceeds 10,000, it prints 1 and 16668 then breaks. Otherwise, it sorts the list, calculates the median, and increments the middle elements until the new median exceeds the original median. It counts the number of increments performed and prints this count for each test case. After processing all test cases, it returns nothing but modifies local variables as described.
