Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `new_median <= median`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is sorted
   - `ma` is incremented by 1
   - `op` is increased by 2
   - `new_median` is equal to the value at index `ma-1` of list `b`
   - `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`
   - `b[ma]` is increased by 1
   - `new_median` is now equal to `b[ma-1]`

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.
   - From the current state, we know `new_median` is equal to `b[ma-1]`.
   - Therefore, `b[ma-1]` must be less than or equal to `median` for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `new_median` (which is `b[ma-1]`) to ensure it remains less than or equal to `median`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`b` is sorted, `ma` is incremented by 1, `op` is increased by 2, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma-1]` and `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`, `b[ma]` is increased by 1, `new_median` is now equal to `b[ma-1]`**
