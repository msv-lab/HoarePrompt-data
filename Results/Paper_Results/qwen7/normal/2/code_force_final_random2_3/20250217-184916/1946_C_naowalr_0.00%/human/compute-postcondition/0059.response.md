Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `i` is `n-1`, and `adj[a]` now includes `b`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Given the initial state, `a` is the second number input from stdin, `b` is the first number input from stdin, `i` is `n-1`, and `adj` is assumed to be a list of lists (or an adjacency list). After executing the code, `b` is added to the list at index `a` in `adj`. All other variables remain unchanged.
