Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning it has run `n-1` times. After these iterations, `i` is `0`. For each pair of integers `(a, b)` read from standard input, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` now contain both `b` and `a`, respectively. All adjacency list entries are bidirectional, indicating a fully constructed undirected graph with `n` nodes; `L` is set to `1`; `R` is set to `100001**.

This means that after the loop has completed, the variable `i` is reset to `0`, and the variable `R` is set to `100001`. The adjacency lists `adj` are fully populated with bidirectional edges, and the variable `L` remains unchanged at `1`.
