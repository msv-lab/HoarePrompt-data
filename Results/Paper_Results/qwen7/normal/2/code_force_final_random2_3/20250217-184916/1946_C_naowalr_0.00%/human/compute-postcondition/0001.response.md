Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `z` and the variable `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `z` is less than `t`.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as `t` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the States**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 (since `z` starts from 0 and increments by 1). The value of `z` is not yet determined because the loop hasn't started executing.

5. **Final State Before Loop Execution**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0**
