Output State: **`L` is the left boundary, `R` is the right boundary, `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

This means that after executing the line `leftover = dfs(1, 1)`, the variable `leftover` now holds the result of the function call `dfs(1, 1)`. All other variables retain their initial values from the precondition.
