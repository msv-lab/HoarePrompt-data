Output State: The loop will execute `n-1` times. After all iterations, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` will be `n-1`, `a` will be the integer value of the first input, and `b` will be the integer value of the second input. For every pair `(a, b)` entered, both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will contain each other, indicating that there is an edge between nodes `a` and `b` in an undirected graph represented by the adjacency list `adj`. All other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body will remain unchanged.
