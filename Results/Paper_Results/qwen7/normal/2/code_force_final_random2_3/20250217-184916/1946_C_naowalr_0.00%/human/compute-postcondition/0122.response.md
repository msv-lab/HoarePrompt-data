Output State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`).**

Explanation: The code `L = x` assigns the value of `x` (which is 50001) to `L`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `L` is updated to 50001, while `R`, `x`, `numCuts`, and the condition involving `numCuts` and `leftover` remain as they were in the initial state.
