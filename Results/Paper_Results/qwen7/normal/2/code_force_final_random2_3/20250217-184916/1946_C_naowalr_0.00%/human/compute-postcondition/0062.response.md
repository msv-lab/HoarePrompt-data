Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `i` is `n-2`, and `adj[b]` includes `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))` reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `i` and `adj[b]` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `a` is now the second number input from stdin, `b` is the first number input from stdin, `i` is still `n-2`, and `adj[b]` still includes `a`.
