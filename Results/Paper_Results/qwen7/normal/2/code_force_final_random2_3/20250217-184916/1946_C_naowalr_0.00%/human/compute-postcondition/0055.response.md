Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, and there is an adjacency list entry for `a` that now includes `b`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` and `b` are integers obtained from stdin, their values remain unchanged. However, the adjacency list `adj` now has an entry for `a` that includes `b`.
