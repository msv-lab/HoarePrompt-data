Postcondition: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is `x`, `R` is `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), `numCuts` remains 0, `L` is `x`, `R` is `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. Otherwise, `numCuts` remains 0, `L` is less than `x - 1`, `R` is `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.**
