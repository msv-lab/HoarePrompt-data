Output State: **All integers entered via stdin up to the point where the loop terminates have been added to the adjacency list `adj`. The variable `i` is `n - 1`, meaning the loop has executed `n - 1` times. `z` remains `t`, `n` is the total number of unique integers entered (plus one), `k` is an integer, and `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list except for the entries that contain the connections between the nodes as specified by the input.**

This means that for every pair of integers `(a, b)` read from standard input, `a` and `b` have been added to each other's adjacency lists in `adj`. The loop continues until it has processed `n - 1` edges, which is the condition for a connected graph with `n` nodes.
