Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `x` is L, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

Explanation: The variable `L` is assigned the value of `x`. Initially, `x` was equal to `(L + R) // 2`. Therefore, after the assignment, `x` now equals `L`. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial states.
