Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is less than `x - 1`, `R` is `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` simply reassigns the value of `numCuts` to 0. Since `numCuts` was already 0 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. The other variables (`L`, `R`, `x`, and `leftover`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
