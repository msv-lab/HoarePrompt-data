Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, and there is an adjacency list entry for `b` that now includes `a`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the adjacency list of `b`. This means that the adjacency list for `b` now includes `a`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
