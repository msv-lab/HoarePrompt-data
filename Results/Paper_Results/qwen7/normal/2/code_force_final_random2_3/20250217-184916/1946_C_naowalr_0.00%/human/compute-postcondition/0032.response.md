Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are integers from inputs, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain each other, forming an undirected graph, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is the integer value of `(1 + 100001) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code `x = (L + R) // 2` calculates the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the value of `x` is `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which simplifies to 50001. This value is assigned to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
