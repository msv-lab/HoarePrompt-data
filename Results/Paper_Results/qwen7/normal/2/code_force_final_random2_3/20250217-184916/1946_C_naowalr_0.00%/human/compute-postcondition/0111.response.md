Output State: **`a` is the integer entered second, `b` is the integer entered first, `z` is `t`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list, `adj[a]` now contains the value `[b]`, `i` is `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contained the value `[a, a, b]`. After executing the code, `adj[a]` will contain `[b]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
