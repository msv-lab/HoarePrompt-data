Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the return value of dfs(1, 1)**

Explanation: The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` calls the function `dfs` with arguments `1` and `1`. The result of this function call is assigned to the variable `leftover`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The value of `numCuts` also remains unchanged as it is set to `0` in the initial state and no operation modifies it.
