Output State: All integers `a` and `b` added to the adjacency list `adj` through the loop will form a complete graph structure. Specifically, `adj[i]` will contain all integers from `1` to `n` (inclusive) except for itself. The variable `i` will be `-1` after the loop has executed all its iterations, indicating that all `n-1` iterations have been completed. The `adj` list will represent a fully connected graph with `n` nodes, where each node is connected to every other node exactly once.

This means that for any two distinct nodes `u` and `v` in the graph (where `1 ≤ u, v ≤ n` and `u ≠ v`), there will be an edge between them in the `adj` list.
