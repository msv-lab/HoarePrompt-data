Output State: **`i` is `n - 5` or `n - 4`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums, `totalOne` is `ol`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `oneInd` the value `2 * preOne[-1]`. The value of `preOne[-1]` is the last element of the list `preOne`, which remains unchanged from its previous state. Therefore, `oneInd` is updated to be twice the last element of `preOne`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
