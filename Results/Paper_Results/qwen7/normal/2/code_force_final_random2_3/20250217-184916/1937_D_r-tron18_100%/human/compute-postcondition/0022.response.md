Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 1 (since `preOne.pop()` was called), `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is the value of `s1[i]` and is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the `preOne` list. Since `preOne` was previously a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, after popping the last element, it now contains cumulative sums starting from 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
