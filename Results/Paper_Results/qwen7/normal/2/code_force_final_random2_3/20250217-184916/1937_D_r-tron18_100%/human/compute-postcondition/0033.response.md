Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and then the previous last element plus `i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is the value of `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `zeroInd` using the function `func_1` applied to the list `suffZero` and two different indices. However, since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `zeroInd`. But we know that `zeroInd` is computed as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
