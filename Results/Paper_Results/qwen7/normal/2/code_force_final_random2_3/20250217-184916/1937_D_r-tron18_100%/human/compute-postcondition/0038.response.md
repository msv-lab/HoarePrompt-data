Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on the value of `el`, and `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros. If `el` is '>', `i` becomes `n - 3`, `totalOne` decreases by 1, and `preOne` starts from 1. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is updated by appending the previous last element plus `i + 1`, and the `i`-th element of `ans` is determined based on the relationship between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`.**
