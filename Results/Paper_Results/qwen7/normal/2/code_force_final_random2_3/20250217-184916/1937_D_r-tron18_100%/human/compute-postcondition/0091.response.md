Output State: `i` is `-1`, `preOne` is an empty list, `totalOne` is `0`, `suffZero` is a list containing only `0`, and `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will decrement from `n-2` to `-1` (since the loop runs in reverse order). Therefore, `i` will eventually become `-1`, indicating that all elements in `s1` have been processed. At this point, `preOne` will be an empty list because it keeps getting popped during each iteration. Similarly, `totalOne` will be `0` since it gets decremented by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. The `suffZero` list will remain with just `0` because it only gets appended to when `el` is not `'>'. Finally, `ans` remains a list of length `n` filled with zeros as no further updates are made to it once `i` becomes `-1`.
