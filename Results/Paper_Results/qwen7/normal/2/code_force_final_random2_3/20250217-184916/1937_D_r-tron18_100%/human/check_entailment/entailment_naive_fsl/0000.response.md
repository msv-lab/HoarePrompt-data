Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the given rules. Specifically, the program seems to be attempting to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using a complex formula involving accumulations and indices, but this approach does not accurately reflect the movement described in the problem.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

- For the input `s = "<>"`, the expected output is `1 4`. This means:
  - If the pinball starts at index 0, it moves left to index -1 and leaves the grid after 1 second.
  - If the pinball starts at index 1, it moves right to index 2, then left to index 1, and finally right to index 3 and leaves the grid after 4 seconds.

However, the provided program does not produce these results. Instead, it calculates something different due to its complex logic, which does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement according to the rules.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
