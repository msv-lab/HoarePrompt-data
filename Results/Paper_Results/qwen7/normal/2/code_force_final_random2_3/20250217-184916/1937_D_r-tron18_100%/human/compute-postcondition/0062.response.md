Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 3`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and `n - 1`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, and `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; if `n - 1` (which is `zr`) is less than or equal to `totalOne` (which is `ol`), then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**
