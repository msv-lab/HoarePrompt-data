You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

At this point, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, but it has been reduced by the number of iterations (which is `n`). `totalOne` is 0 because it has been decremented until it reaches 0. `suffZero` is a list containing only 0, as it was appended to in each iteration but never removed from. `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, as no non-zero values were added to it within the loop since the conditions for updating `ans` were not met in any iteration.
    #
    #In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` has reached `-1`, indicating the loop has completed. The list `preOne` has been reduced to a size of `n` minus the number of iterations, `totalOne` is 0, `suffZero` contains only the initial 0, and `ans` remains a list of zeros of length `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the given rules. Specifically, the program seems to be attempting to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using a complex formula involving accumulations and indices, but this approach does not accurately reflect the movement described in the problem.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

- For the input `s = "<>"`, the expected output is `1 4`. This means:
  - If the pinball starts at index 0, it moves left to index -1 and leaves the grid after 1 second.
  - If the pinball starts at index 1, it moves right to index 2, then left to index 1, and finally right to index 3 and leaves the grid after 4 seconds.

However, the provided program does not produce these results. Instead, it calculates something different due to its complex logic, which does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement according to the rules.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
