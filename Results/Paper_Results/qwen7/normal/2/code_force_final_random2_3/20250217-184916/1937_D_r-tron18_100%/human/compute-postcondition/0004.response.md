Output State: **`preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` zeros. This operation does not affect the values of `preOne`, `totalOne`, or `suffZero`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `ans` is updated to be a list of `n` zeros.
