Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.

- If `ol <= zr`, then `zeroInd` is calculated as 2 times the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is calculated as 2 times the last element of `preOne` minus the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- If `ol > zr`, then `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` minus `func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.
