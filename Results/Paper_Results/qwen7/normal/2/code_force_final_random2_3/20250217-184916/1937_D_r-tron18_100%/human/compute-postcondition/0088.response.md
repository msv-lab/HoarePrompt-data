Postcondition: `i` is `n - 5` or `n - 4`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums, `totalOne` is `ol`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to itself, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the following conditions: if `zr <= ol`, then `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`; otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.
