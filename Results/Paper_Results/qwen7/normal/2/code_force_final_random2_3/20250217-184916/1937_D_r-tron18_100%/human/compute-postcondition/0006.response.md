Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is the value of `s1[i]`**.

Explanation: The line `el = s1[i]` assigns the value of `s1[i]` to the variable `el`. The value of `i` is decremented by 1 since `i` was initially `n - 1` and now becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
