Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and then the previous last element plus `i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, `el` is the value of `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The specific values or expressions for `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are preserved as they were before the assignment.
