Output State: **`preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0.**

The code initializes `suffZero` as a list containing a single element, which is 0. This does not affect the values of `preOne` or `totalOne`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
