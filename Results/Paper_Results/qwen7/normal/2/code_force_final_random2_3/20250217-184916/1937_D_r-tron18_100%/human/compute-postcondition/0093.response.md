Output: **0 0 0 ... 0 (n times)**

Explanation:
- `i` has reached `-1`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `ans` is described as a list of length `n` filled with zeros. Since no non-zero values were added to it within the loop, `ans` remains a list of zeros of length `n`.

Therefore, when the `print(*ans)` statement executes, it will print a list of `n` zeros.
