Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `totalOne` is `n - 1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 1 (since `preOne.pop()` was called), `totalOne` is decreased by 1, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is the value of `s1[i]` and is '>', `ol` is `n - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `totalOne -= 1` decreases the value of `totalOne` by 1. Initially, `totalOne` was equal to `n`, so now it is `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
