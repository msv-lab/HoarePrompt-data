Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on the value of `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `fi` which is defined as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`. This value is computed using the function `func_1` and the values of `preOne` and `zr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
