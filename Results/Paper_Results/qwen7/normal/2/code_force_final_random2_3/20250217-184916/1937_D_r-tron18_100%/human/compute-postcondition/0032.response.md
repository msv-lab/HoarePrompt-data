Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and then the previous last element plus `i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is the value of `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `zr` is greater than `ol`**
