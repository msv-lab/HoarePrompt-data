Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is the value of `s1[i]`, `el` equals '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `zeroInd` is calculated as 2 times the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` and the condition `ol <= zr` is true.**

Explanation: The code assigns `zeroInd` the value of twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`. Since `suffZero` is a list containing only one element (0), and `ol` is `totalOne` which is the length of `pre`, the exact value of `zeroInd` depends on the implementation of `func_1`. However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_1`, we can only say that `zeroInd` is 2 times the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
