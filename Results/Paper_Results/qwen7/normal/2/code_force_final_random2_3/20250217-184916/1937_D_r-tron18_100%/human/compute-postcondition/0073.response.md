Output State: **`i` is `n - 5` or `n - 4`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums, `totalOne` is the length of `preOne`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is the length of `preOne`, `zr` is the length of `suffZero` minus 1, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)**

Explanation: The code subtracts `func_1(preOne, 1)` from `oneInd`. Since `oneInd` was initially the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, after executing the line `oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)`, `oneInd` now becomes `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
