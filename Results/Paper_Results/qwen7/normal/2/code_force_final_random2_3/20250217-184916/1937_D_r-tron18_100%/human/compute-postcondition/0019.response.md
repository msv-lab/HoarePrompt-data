Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` minus `func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, `ol` is greater than `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` where `i` is `n - 2`. The new value of `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. Since `zeroInd` is 0, the formula simplifies to `- oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. The values of `preOne`, `totalOne`, `suffZero`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `oneInd`, `fi`, and `ol` remain unchanged.
