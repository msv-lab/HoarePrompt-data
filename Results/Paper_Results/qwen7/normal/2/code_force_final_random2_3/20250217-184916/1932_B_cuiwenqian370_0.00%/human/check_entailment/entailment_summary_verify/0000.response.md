### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires determining the year in which all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially based on their periodicities \( a_i \).
   - For each sign, the tribe waits for the next sign to occur strictly after the previous one has occurred.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function is designed to handle paths containing characters '@' and '*', which are unrelated to the periodicities of the signs.
   - It does not perform any operations related to the periodicities of the signs or the sequential occurrence of the signs.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is unrelated to the problem, `func_2` also fails to correctly solve the problem.

Given these observations, the program does not implement the logic required to find the year in which all signs will occur sequentially based on their periodicities. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect for the given problem description.
