Output State: **`index` is 3, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the second element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the third element of `data` converted to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `results` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `path`. Given that `index` is 3, `path` is set to the fourth element of the list `data`, which is converted to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
