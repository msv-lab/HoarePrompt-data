Output State: **`i` is 4; `n` is the length of `path`; `dp[4]` is the maximum of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]` plus 1 if `path[4]` is '@', otherwise plus 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@', or plus 0 otherwise. Given that `i` is initially 4, the code sets `dp[4]` to be the maximum of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]` plus 1 if `path[4]` is '@', or plus 0 otherwise. The values of `n` and the initial state of `dp[4]` remain unchanged.
