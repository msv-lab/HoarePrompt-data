Output State: **`index` is 4, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the second element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the third element of `data` converted to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `results` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `t`, `n`, `path`, `data`, and `results` remain unchanged from their initial states.
