Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved here are `result` and `results`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 3.
   - `n` is the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer.
   - `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer.
   - `results` contains at least one element from its previous contents.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `results` contains at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `results`, we need to ensure that `results` still contains at least one element.
   - `t`, `n`, and `path` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `results` still contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 3, `n` is the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` contains at least one element from its previous contents**
