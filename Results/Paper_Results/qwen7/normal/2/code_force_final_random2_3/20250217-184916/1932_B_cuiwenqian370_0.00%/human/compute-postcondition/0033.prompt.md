You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs for each test case. path is a string containing n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is 10, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 3, `n` is the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` now contains the return value of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous contents.
    #
    #This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations (as determined by the initial value of `t` being decremented by 3 for each iteration), the `index` variable will be at 10 (since it increments by 2 with each iteration of the loop). The `t` variable will be the original value minus 3, as it is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The `n` variable will be the sixth element of the `data` list converted to an integer, and the `path` variable will be the tenth element of the `data` list converted to an integer. The `results` list will contain the cumulative results of calling `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `index` is 10, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 6, `n` is the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` contains the cumulative results of calling `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), representing the number of test cases; `n`, an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), representing the number of signs for each test case; and `path`, a string containing `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n`, each between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case. The function does not return any value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
