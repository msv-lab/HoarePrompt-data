Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not match the problem description at all. The problem describes a scenario involving the occurrence of signs of the apocalypse at specific intervals, and the code seems to be dealing with a different problem related to paths and dynamic programming.
2. The `func_1` function is designed to process a string where '@' represents a valid state and '*' represents an invalid state. It calculates the maximum number of valid states using dynamic programming, but this logic is completely unrelated to the problem of determining the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur.
3. The `func_2` function reads input and calls `func_1` on each test case, but again, this is not relevant to the problem at hand.
4. Since the functions provided do not implement the logic required to solve the given problem, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
