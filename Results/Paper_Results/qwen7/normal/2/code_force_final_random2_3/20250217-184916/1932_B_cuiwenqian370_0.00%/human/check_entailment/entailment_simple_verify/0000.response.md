### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the given problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Problem Mismatch**: The problem description specifies that the program should determine the year in which all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially based on their periodicities. However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` in the provided code are designed to solve a different problem involving paths containing `@` and `*` characters. This is clearly unrelated to the problem at hand.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes a string `path` as input and processes it to find the maximum sum of consecutive `@` characters, considering the constraints given by `*` characters.
   - This logic is irrelevant to the problem of determining the year when all signs occur based on their periodicities.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads input data, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is not solving the intended problem, `func_2` also fails to solve the intended problem.

Given these observations, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not implement the required functionality to determine the year in which all signs of the apocalypse will occur based on their periodicities.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect for the given problem description.
