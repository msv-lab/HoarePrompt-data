Output State: **`index` is 6, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 1, `n` is 4, `path` is the fifth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(path)`**.

Explanation: The line `results.append(func_1(path))` appends the return value of `func_1(path)` to the list `results`. None of the other variables (`index`, `t`, `n`, `path`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
