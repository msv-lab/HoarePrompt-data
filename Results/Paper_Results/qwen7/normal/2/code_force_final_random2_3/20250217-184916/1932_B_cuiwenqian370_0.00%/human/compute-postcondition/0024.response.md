Output State: `index` is 10, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 3, `n` is the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` now contains the return value of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous contents.

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations (as determined by the initial value of `t` being decremented by 3 for each iteration), the `index` variable will be at 10 (since it increments by 2 with each iteration of the loop). The `t` variable will be the original value minus 3, as it is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The `n` variable will be the sixth element of the `data` list converted to an integer, and the `path` variable will be the tenth element of the `data` list converted to an integer. The `results` list will contain the cumulative results of calling `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
