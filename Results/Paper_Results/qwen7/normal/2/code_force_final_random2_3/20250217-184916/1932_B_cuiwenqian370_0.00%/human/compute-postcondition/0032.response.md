Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), representing the number of test cases; `n`, an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), representing the number of signs for each test case; and `path`, a string containing `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n`, each between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case. The function does not return any value.**
