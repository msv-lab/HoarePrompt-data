Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not match the problem description. The problem describes a scenario involving signs of the apocalypse occurring periodically, but the code defines two functions that do not relate to this scenario. Instead, it deals with a sequence of characters (`@` and `*`) and computes the maximum sum of consecutive `@` characters, considering the constraints given by `*` characters.
2. The first function `func_1` is designed to process a string of characters and compute the maximum sum of consecutive `@` characters, taking into account the presence of `*` characters which reset the sum to negative infinity.
3. The second function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case, appending the results to a list.
4. Given that the problem description and the annotated program do not align, the provided program cannot solve the given problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
