Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem requires finding the year in which all n signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially, based on their periodicities. However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` in the provided code are designed to solve a different problem related to paths containing '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the given problem.

The functions do not compute the year when all signs occur based on their periodicities. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
