Output State: **`index` is 8, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 2, `n` is the sixth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the seventh element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` now contains the return value of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous contents.**

Explanation: The code appends the return value of `func_1(path)` to the `results` list. The values of `index`, `t`, `n`, and `path` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `results` list now includes the return value of `func_1(path)`.
