Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `result` which comes from the `results` list.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 3.
   - `n` is the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer.
   - `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer.
   - `results` contains the return value of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous contents.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `results` list.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `results` contained some elements.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element.

5. **Update the state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `results`, the variable `result` will take the next element from `results`.
   - The variables `t`, `n`, and `path` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 3, `n` is the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` contains at least one element from its previous contents**.
