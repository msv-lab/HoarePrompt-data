Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `index` is 10, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 3, `n` is the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` now contains the return value of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous contents.

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations (as determined by the initial value of `t` being decremented by 3 for each iteration), the `index` variable will be at 10 (since it increments by 2 with each iteration of the loop). The `t` variable will be the original value minus 3, as it is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The `n` variable will be the sixth element of the `data` list converted to an integer, and the `path` variable will be the tenth element of the `data` list converted to an integer. The `results` list will contain the cumulative results of calling `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 3, `n` is the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous contents

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 3, `n` is the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` contains at least one element from its previous contents

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 3, `n` is the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` contains at least one element from its previous contents




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
