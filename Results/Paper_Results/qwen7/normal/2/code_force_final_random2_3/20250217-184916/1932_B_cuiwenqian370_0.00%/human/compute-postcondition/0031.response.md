Output State: **`index` is 10, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 6, `n` is the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` contains the cumulative results of calling `func_1(path)` for each iteration of the loop.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations, the `index` variable remains at 10 since it increments by 2 with each iteration and starts at 10. The `t` variable is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 6 because it is decremented by 1 in each of the 6 iterations (from the initial state where it was decremented by 3 for the first iteration). The `n` variable is the eighth element of the `data` list converted to an integer, and the `path` variable is the ninth element of the `data` list converted to an integer. The `results` list contains the cumulative results of calling `func_1(path)` six times, once for each iteration of the loop.
