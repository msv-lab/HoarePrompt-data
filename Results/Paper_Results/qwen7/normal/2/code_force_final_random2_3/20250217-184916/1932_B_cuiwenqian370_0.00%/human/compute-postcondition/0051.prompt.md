You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a string consisting of characters '@' and '*', where the length of the string is at least 1.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `path` is a string consisting of characters '@' and '*', `n` is the length of `path`, and the length of `path` is not 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if (path[0] == '@') :
        dp[0] = 1
    else :
        if (path[0] == '*') :
            dp[0] = -float('inf')
        #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of characters '@' and '*', `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the first character of `path` is '*', the first element of `dp` is set to `-inf`.
    #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of characters '@' and '*', `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the first character of `path` is '@', the first element of `dp` is set to 1. If the first character of `path` is '*', the first element of `dp` is set to `-inf`.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of characters '@' and '*', `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` elements where:
        #- The first element of `dp` is either 1 (if the first character of `path` is '@') or `-inf` (if the first character of `path` is '*').
        #- The second element of `dp` is `-inf` if the second character of `path` is '*', otherwise it is `dp[0] + 1` if the second character of `path` is '@'.
    #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of characters '@' and '*', `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` elements where:
    #- The first element of `dp` is either 1 (if the first character of `path` is '@') or `-inf` (if the first character of `path` is '*').
    #- The second element of `dp` is `-inf` if the second character of `path` is '*', otherwise it is `dp[0] + 1` if the second character of `path` is '@'.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations up to the length of the `path` string. For each index `i` from 2 to `n-1`, the value of `dp[i]` will be determined based on the conditions specified within the loop. Specifically, if `path[i]` is '*', then `dp[i]` will be `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` will be the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@', or plus 0 if `path[i]` is '*'. All other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after running the loop through all iterations, `dp` will contain values that reflect the maximum possible sum of consecutive '@' characters, considering the constraints given by '*' characters in the `path` string.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value among the elements in the `dp` list that are greater than negative infinity.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `path`, which is a string consisting of characters '@' and '*', where the length of the string is at least 1. The function returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, the function returns the maximum value among the elements in the `dp` list that are greater than negative infinity.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value among the elements in the `dp` list that are greater than negative infinity.
