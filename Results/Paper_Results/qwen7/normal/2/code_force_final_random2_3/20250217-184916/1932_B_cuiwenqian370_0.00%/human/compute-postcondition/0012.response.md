Output State: **`index` is 4, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 1, `n` is 4, `path` is the third element of `data` converted to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to be the integer value of `data[index]`. Since `index` is 4, `n` is set to the fifth element of `data` converted to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
