Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `path` consisting of characters '@' and '*', where the length of the string is at least 1. It initializes a list `dp` to store intermediate results. Depending on the first character of `path`, it sets the initial value of `dp[0]`. Then, it iterates through the remaining characters of `path`, updating `dp` based on whether the current character is '@' or '*'. Finally, it returns the maximum value among the elements in `dp` that are greater than negative infinity, or 0 if no such value exists.**
