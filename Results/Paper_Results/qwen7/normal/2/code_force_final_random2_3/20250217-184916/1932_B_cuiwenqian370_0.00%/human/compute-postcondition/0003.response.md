Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `path` is a string, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `index`. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the initial values of `t`, `n`, `path`, and `data` remain unchanged, and only `index` is updated to `1`.
