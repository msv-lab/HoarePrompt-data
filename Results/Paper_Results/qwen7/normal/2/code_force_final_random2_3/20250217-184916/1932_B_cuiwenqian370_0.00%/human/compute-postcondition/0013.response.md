Output State: **`index` is 5, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 1, `n` is 4, `path` is the third element of `data` converted to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`**.

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 4, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 5. The values of `t`, `n`, `path`, `data`, and `results` remain unchanged from their initial states.
