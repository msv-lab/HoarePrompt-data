Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `yb` are integers assigned by the input split and converted to integers. `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`. The absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even; `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - xa`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `l` the value of the maximum between 1 and `ya - xa`. Since `xa` is less than or equal to `xb` and their absolute difference is even, `ya - xa` is an integer. The value of `l` will be `ya - xa` if `ya - xa` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise, it will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
