Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers from the input, `l` and `r` are integers with their previous values. If `xa > xb`, then `l` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and either `yb - x` or `ya - x`, and `r` is set to the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
