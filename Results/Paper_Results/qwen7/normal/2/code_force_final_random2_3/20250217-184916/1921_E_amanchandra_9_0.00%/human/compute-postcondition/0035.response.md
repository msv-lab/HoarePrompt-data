Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers from the input, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to be the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `x` is already calculated as the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, so it does not affect the assignment to `r`.
