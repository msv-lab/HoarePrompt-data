You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases provided as input. For each iteration, the values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, and `yb` will be updated based on the input for that specific test case. The variables `l` and `r` will retain their final values determined during the last iteration of the loop for each respective test case. If `xa > xb`, the output for that test case will always be 'Draw'. Otherwise, the output will be 'Alice' if both conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` are met, or 'Bob' if the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x` are met. All other variables outside the loop, such as `t`, will remain unchanged from their initial state.
    #
    #In summary, the output state will include the total number of iterations (`i`), the final values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, and `yb` for each test case, and the corresponding outputs ('Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob') for each test case, with `l` and `r` holding their last computed values within each test case's context.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the different movement rules for Alice and Bob, and it does not simulate the game to determine the winner based on optimal play.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Movement Rules Not Properly Implemented**:
   - Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left.
   - Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left.
   - The current implementation does not correctly simulate these movements and does not handle the game logic to determine the winner based on optimal play.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The program attempts to determine the winner by checking distances and boundaries but does not simulate the actual game steps.
   - The logic `if xa > xb` is incorrect and does not reflect the actual game dynamics. It only checks if Alice's row position is greater than Bob's, which is irrelevant to the game's outcome.

3. **Lack of Simulation**:
   - The program does not simulate the game to see if either player can force a win by moving optimally. Instead, it makes assumptions about distances and boundaries without actually simulating the moves.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the game step-by-step, considering all possible moves for both players and determining the winner based on optimal play. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. **Simulate Moves**: Simulate the moves for both players in a loop until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
2. **Check Winning Conditions**: Check if a player can move to the other player's position.
3. **Handle Draw Conditions**: Ensure that the game ends in a draw if neither player can make a move.

Given the current implementation does not follow the problem description and does not correctly simulate the game, the program is incorrect.
