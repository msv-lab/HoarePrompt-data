Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are integers with their new values from the input, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of the minimum between `w` and `yb + x`. The values of `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged from their previous states.
