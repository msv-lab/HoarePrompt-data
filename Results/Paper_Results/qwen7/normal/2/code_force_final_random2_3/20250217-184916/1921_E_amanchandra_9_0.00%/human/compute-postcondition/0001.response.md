Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers assigned by the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into six parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. Since the exact values of the input are not specified, we only know that these variables now hold integer values derived from the input.
