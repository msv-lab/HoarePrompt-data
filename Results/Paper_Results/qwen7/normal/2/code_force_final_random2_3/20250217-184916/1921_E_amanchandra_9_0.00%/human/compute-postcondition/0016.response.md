Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the input value from `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the input value.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - The input value remains unchanged unless it is modified within the loop body, but since the problem states that the loop body is omitted, we assume the input value remains the same.

4. **Initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb`, `l`, `r` are integers.
   - If `xa` is greater than `xb`, no changes are made to `l` and `r`.
   - If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is set to `yb - x` if `yb - x` is at least 1, otherwise `l` is 1; `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
   - If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and `ya - xa`; `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on the input value and `i`, and there are no modifications to these variables within the loop body, the only thing that changes is `i` which will be incremented by 1.
   - The input value remains the same, and the values of `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb`, `l`, and `r` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless they are modified within the loop body, which they are not according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb`, `l`, `r`) remain the same.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration, the new state will be:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The input value remains the same.
- The values of `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb`, `l`, and `r` remain the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb`, `l`, `r` are the same as at the end of the previous iteration, and the input value remains the same**.

Since the exact numerical values of `i` and the input value are not provided, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb`, `l`, `r` are integers with their previous values, and the input value remains the same**.
