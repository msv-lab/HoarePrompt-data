Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are integers with their new values from the input, `l`, `r` are integers with their previous values, `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2.**

This means that the value of `x` is calculated as the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, while all other variables retain their previous states.
