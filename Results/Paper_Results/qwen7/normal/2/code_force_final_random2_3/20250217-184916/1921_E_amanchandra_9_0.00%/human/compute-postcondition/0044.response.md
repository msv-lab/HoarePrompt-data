Output State: All the input values \( h \), \( w \), \( x_a \), \( x_b \), \( y_a \), \( y_b \) will be processed according to the given conditions for each iteration. The variables \( l \) and \( r \) will be updated based on the logic provided within the loop for each pair of \( h \), \( w \), \( x_a \), \( x_b \), \( y_a \), \( y_b \).

For each iteration:
- If \( x_a > x_b \), the output will always be "Draw".
- If \( x_a \leq x_b \):
  - If \( |x_a - x_b| \) is odd, \( l \) is set to \( \max(1, y_b - \frac{|x_a - x_b|}{2}) \) and \( r \) is set to \( \min(w, y_b + \frac{|x_a - x_b|}{2}) \).
  - If \( |x_a - x_b| \) is even, \( l \) is set to \( \max(1, y_a - \frac{|x_a - x_b|}{2}) \) and \( r \) is set to \( \min(w, y_b + \frac{|x_a - x_b|}{2}) \).

After processing all the inputs, the final values of \( l \) and \( r \) will reflect the last set of computations performed on the last input pair \( h \), \( w \), \( x_a \), \( x_b \), \( y_a \), \( y_b \). The outputs for each iteration will be printed as specified by the conditions inside the loop.
