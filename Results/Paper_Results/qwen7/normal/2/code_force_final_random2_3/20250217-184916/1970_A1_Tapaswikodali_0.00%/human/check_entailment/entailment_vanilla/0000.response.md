### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Balance Calculation:**
   - The program correctly reads the input string `s`.
   - It iterates through each character of the string, updating the balance as it goes.
   - It stores tuples of `(balance, -position, character)` in the `details` list. Using `-position` ensures that in case of equal balances, characters from later positions come before those from earlier positions.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The `details` list is sorted based on the balance values in ascending order. If there are ties, the `-position` ensures that characters from later positions come first, which is consistent with the requirement to break ties in decreasing order of position.

3. **Constructing the Result:**
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list, ignoring the balance and position information.

4. **Output:**
   - The final result is printed, which should be the balanced shuffle of the input string.

Given the problem statement and the implementation, the program appears to follow the steps correctly. The use of `-position` in sorting ensures that the correct order is maintained when there are ties in balance.

### Correctness:

- **True**: The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
