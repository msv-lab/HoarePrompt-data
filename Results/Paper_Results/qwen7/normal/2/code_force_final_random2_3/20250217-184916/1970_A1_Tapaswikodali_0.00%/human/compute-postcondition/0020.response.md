Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is 2, `balance` is either -1, -3, 1, or -1, `details` is a list containing three tuples where the first tuple is (-1, -2, '(')**

Explanation: The code `balance -= 1` decrements the value of `balance` by 1. Given that `balance` was either 0, -2, 2, or 0, after decrementing by 1, the new possible values for `balance` are -1, -3, 1, or -1. The string `s`, variable `i`, and the list `details` remain unchanged from their initial states.
