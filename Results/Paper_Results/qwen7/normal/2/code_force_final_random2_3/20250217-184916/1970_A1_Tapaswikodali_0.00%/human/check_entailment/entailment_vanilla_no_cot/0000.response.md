Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Balance Calculation and Details Collection**:
   - The program iterates through the input string `s` and calculates the balance at each position.
   - It appends tuples containing the balance, the negative position (to ensure higher positions come first in case of equal balances), and the character itself to the `details` list.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The `details` list is sorted based on the balance values. In case of ties, the negative position ensures that later characters (higher indices) come first.

3. **Result Construction**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list.

This approach ensures that the resulting sequence maintains the properties of a balanced shuffle as defined in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.
