Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is either 2 or 3, `balance` is either -1, -3, 1, or 3, `details` is a list containing four tuples, where the fourth tuple is (balance, -i, char)**.

Explanation: The code `details.append((balance, -i, char))` appends a new tuple to the list `details`. The tuple contains the current values of `balance`, `-i`, and `char`. Since `char` is either "(" or ")", the third element of the new tuple will be either "(", with the first element being `balance` and the second element being `-i`. Given the initial conditions, the fourth tuple in `details` will be (balance, -i, char), updating the list `details` to contain four tuples.
