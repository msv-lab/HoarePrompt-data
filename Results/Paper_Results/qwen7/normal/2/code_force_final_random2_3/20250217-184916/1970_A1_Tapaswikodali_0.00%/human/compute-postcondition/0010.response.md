Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is 0, `balance` is either 1 or -1 depending on the first character of `s`, `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, -i, char)` where `char` is the first character of `s`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple to the `details` list. The tuple contains three elements: `balance`, `-i`, and `char`. Given the initial state, `balance` is either 1 (if the first character is '(') or -1 (if the first character is ')'), `i` is 0, and `char` is the first character of the string `s`. Therefore, `details` now contains a single tuple with these values.
