Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `char`, and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `s` is an input string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.
   - `balance` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the loop head).
   - `details` is an empty list (though this variable is not used in the loop head).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will iterate over each character in the string `s` using `enumerate(s)`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `s` is not an empty string.

4. **Adjust the states of the variables in the loop head**:
   - `i` will be the index of the current character in the string `s`.
   - `char` will be the current character from the string `s`.
   - Since `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence, it must contain at least one character.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `s` must be a non-empty string (since it is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence, it already satisfies this condition).
- `i` must start from 0 (the first index of the string).
- `char` must be the first character of the string `s`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `s`**.
