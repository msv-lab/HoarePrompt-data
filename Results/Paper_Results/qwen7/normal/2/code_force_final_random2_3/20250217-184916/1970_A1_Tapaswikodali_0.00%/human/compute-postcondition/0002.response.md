Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence; `balance` is 0; `details` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `details`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `balance`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
