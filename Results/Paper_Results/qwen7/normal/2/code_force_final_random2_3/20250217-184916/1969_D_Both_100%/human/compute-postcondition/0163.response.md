Output State: **`bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and an element from `bonuses`, `removed_item` will be True for each iteration where the operation `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` was executed, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 if it was initially greater than 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list; `prices` is updated to a list of negative values of the original `prices`, `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.**

Explanation: The code `combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))` creates a list of tuples where each tuple contains one element from `neg_prices` and one element from `bonuses`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
