Output State: **`heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `combined.pop()`, `combined` now has at least one element less, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `removed_item` is True, and `current_profit` is updated to `max_profit - item[1] - item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, or `max_profit + item[0] - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`**.

This means that the `current_profit` has been updated based on the condition given, and the value of `current_profit` is now either `max_profit - item[1] - item[0]` or `max_profit + item[0] - item[1]` depending on whether `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, respectively. All other variables remain in their previous states.
