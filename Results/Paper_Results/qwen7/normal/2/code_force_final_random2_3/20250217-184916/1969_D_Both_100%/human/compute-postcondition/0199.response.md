Postcondition: **`combined` is now a list with one less item than before; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `heap` has had its last element replaced by `item`; `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item` if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `current_profit` remains unchanged.**
