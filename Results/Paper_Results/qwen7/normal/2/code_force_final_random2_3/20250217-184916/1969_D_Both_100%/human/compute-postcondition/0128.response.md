Output State: **`heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `combined.pop()`, `combined` now has one less element, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `current_profit` is equal to `max_profit`, and `removed_item` is True.**

Explanation: The code `item = combined.pop()` removes the last element from the `combined` list and assigns it to `item`. This operation reduces the number of elements in `combined` by one. Since `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, the state of `heap` is updated accordingly. All other variables (`max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `removed_item`) remain unchanged.
