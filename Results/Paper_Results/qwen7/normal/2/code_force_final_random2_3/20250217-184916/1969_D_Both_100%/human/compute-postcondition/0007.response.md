Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0; `heap` is an empty list; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`; `prices` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`**

The code `bonuses = list(func_2())` assigns the list returned by `func_2()` to the variable `bonuses`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
