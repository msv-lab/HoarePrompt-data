Output State: **`heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `item`, `combined` is now a list with one less element, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `current_profit` is equal to `max_profit`, `removed_item` is True.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` simply assigns the current value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. Since `current_profit` was increased by `item[0]` before this line, `max_profit` now holds the same value as `current_profit`. All other variables remain in their original state as described in the initial state.
