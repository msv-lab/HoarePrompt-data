Postcondition: `heap` now contains all items except the one that was replaced by `item`, `removed_item` is the item that was heappushed and heappopped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted based on whether `item[0] + item[1]` is non-negative: if `item[0] + item[1]` is non-negative, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`, `max_profit` is updated to be `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, and `combined` must be `True`.
