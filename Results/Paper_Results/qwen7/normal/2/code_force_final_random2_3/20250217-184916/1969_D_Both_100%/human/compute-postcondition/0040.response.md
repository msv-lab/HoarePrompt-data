Postcondition: `combined` is now one item shorter, `heap` contains the k smallest elements from the original combined list excluding the last popped item, `k` remains 0, and `current_profit` is either the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` holds true, or the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`. `max_profit` is equal to the maximum of `current_profit` and `max_profit`, and all other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
