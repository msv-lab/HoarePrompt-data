Output State: **`combined` is empty, `heap` is an empty list, `k` is the return value of `func_2()`, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `prices` is a list generated by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code `prices = list(func_2())` assigns the list returned by `func_2()` to the variable `prices`. The values of `combined`, `heap`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their previous values. The function `func_2()` is called twice, and its return value replaces both `n` and `k`.
