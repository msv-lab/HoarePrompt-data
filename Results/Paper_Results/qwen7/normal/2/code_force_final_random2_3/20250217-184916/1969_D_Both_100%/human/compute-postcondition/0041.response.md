Output State: **`combined` is now one item shorter, `heap` contains the k smallest elements from the original combined list excluding the last popped item and the pushed item, `k` remains 0, `current_profit` is either the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` holds true, or the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`. `max_profit` is equal to the maximum of `current_profit` and `max_profit`, and all other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.**

Explanation: The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` performs two operations:
1. It pops the smallest element from the heap (`heap`).
2. It pushes the new item into the heap.

After these operations:
- The `combined` list is one item shorter because the `heappushpop` operation removes one item.
- The `heap` now contains the k smallest elements from the original combined list, excluding the last popped item and including the new item.
- The `current_profit` is recalculated based on the updated `heap` and the condition `item[0] + item[1]`.
- The `max_profit` is updated to be the maximum of the current `max_profit` and the new `current_profit`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
