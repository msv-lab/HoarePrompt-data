Output State: **`combined` is now two items shorter, `heap` contains the k smallest elements from the original combined list excluding the last two popped items and the pushed item, `k` remains 0, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` as `item[0] + item[1] < 0` holds true, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` (since `max_profit` was previously the maximum of `current_profit` and `max_profit`), and all other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.**

This means that the `max_profit` variable has been updated to be equal to `current_profit`, while all other variables and their states remain the same as before the execution of the given code snippet.
