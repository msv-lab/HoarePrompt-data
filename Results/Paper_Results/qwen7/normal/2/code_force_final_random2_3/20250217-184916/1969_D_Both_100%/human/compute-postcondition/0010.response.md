Output State: **`max_profit` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `prices` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list called `combined` which is a zipped version of `neg_prices` and `bonuses`. Each element in `combined` is a tuple consisting of one element from `neg_prices` paired with the corresponding element from `bonuses`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
