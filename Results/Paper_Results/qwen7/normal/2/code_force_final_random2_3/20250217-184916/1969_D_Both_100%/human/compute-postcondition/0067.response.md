Postcondition: **`combined` has at least one item less than before, `current_profit` is reduced by either the second element of the last item of the original `combined` list (if the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` is true) or the sum of the first element of the last item of the original `combined` list and the first element of the `item` (if the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` is false). `item` is now the last element of the original `combined` list, `heap` contains the `item` that was heappushed and heappopped, and `max_profit` remains unchanged if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.**
