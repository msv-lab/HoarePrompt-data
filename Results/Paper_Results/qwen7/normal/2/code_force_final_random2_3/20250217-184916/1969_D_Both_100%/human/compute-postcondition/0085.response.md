Output State: **`combined` is empty, `heap` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `prices` is a list generated by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the return value of `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `current_profit` is 0.**

In this step, the code initializes `current_profit` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
