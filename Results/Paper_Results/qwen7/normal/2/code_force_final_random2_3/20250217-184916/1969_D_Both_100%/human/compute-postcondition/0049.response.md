Postcondition: `combined` is now two items shorter, `heap` contains the k smallest elements from the original combined list excluding the last two popped items and the pushed item, `k` remains 0, `current_profit` is the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` as `item[0] + item[1] < 0` holds true, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` (since `max_profit` was previously the maximum of `current_profit` and `max_profit`), and all other variables (`test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
