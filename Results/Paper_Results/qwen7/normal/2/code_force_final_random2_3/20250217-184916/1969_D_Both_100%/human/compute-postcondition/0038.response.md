Output State: **`combined` is one item shorter, `heap` contains the k smallest elements from the original combined list excluding the last popped item, `k` remains 0, `current_profit` is the result of func_3(combined, heap) + item[0], `max_profit` is equal to max(current_profit, max_profit), and all other variables (test_cases, remaining_items, neg_prices, prices, bonuses, n) remain unchanged from their initial states. The sum of item[0] and item[1] is less than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the `current_profit` by adding `item[0]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
