Output State: **`idx1` is equal to `i`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` plus 2 equals `n` minus 1, and in this case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; the elements at index `i + 1` in list `l1` and index `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal, and the value at index `i + 1` in list `l1` is equal to `a2`.**

Explanation: The code sets `p1` to 1. This changes the condition that `i` plus the maximum value between `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1. Since `p1` is now 1, the updated condition is `i + 1 = n - 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
