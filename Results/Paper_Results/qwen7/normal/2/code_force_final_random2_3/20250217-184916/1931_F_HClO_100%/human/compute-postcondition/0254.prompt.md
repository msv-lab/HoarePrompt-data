Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `m` is reduced by 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations, `t` is `t-1`, `a1` is the first integer input, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `a2` is the second integer input by the user, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be at least 1, `i` plus the maximum value between `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, and in this case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Additionally, either the elements at index `i + p1` in list `l1` and index `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal, or the if condition is not met, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then either `idx1` is `i` (if `idx1` is already non-negative) or `idx2` is `i`. Otherwise, if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, and `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, we also break out of the loop or if statement we were inside.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
