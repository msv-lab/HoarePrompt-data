Output State: **`a3` is a new integer obtained from the first input split by spaces, `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs split by spaces, `i` is `n-2`, `p1` and `p2` will either both be 0 (if no matches were found that satisfied the conditions in the loop), or one of them will be 1 (if a match was found and the corresponding index was updated). The value of `idx1` will be updated to the index where the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` was last satisfied, and `idx2` is now `n - 2`. If no such indices were found, `idx1` and `idx2` will remain -1. `val` is an empty list. Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but moves the control to the start of the next iteration of the loop. The index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`. `l2` has had the value of `a2` inserted at the index `idx1`. `l` is now equal to `l2`.**

In this case, the line `l = l2` simply assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. Since `l2` has already had the value of `a2` inserted at the index `idx1`, `l` also contains this modification. All other variables remain unchanged.
