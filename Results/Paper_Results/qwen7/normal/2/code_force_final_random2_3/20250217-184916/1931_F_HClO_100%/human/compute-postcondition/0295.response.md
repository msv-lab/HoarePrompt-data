Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is either `-1` or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not `-1` and is either `n - 2` or another valid index, `val` is an empty list or a list containing a single tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, and `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers, `l` is assigned the value of `l1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it is a reference to `l2`.
