Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if either:
     - `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1.
     - `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n-1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` would be 1.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - The conditions for breaking out of the loop (i.e., `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`) are not relevant for determining the next state of the loop itself.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1**
