Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is 1, and we take an input from the user but do not assign it to any variable.**

The `input()` function is called but does not assign the input to any variable, so the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The input taken by the `input()` function is not stored or used in the program, so it does not affect the values of the existing variables.
