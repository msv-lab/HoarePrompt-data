The function processes multiple test cases, each involving two lists of integers (l1 and l2). For each test case, it checks if the lists can be transformed into each other by inserting one specific element (a2 into l1 or a1 into l2) at certain positions. If the lists can be made identical through such transformations, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function also handles additional elements (a3, a4, etc.) that may be provided and ensures the final lists match these elements' positions.
