Output State: **`m` must be at least 3, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing a tuple of (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`. The variable `m` remains unchanged and must still be at least 3. The variable `val` is updated to contain a tuple of (`a3`, `l3`).
