Output State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` contains at least one tuple (though it contains five), and the current list `l3` is not equal to the list generated by excluding `a3` from the original list `l`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables before the `break` statement remain unchanged.
