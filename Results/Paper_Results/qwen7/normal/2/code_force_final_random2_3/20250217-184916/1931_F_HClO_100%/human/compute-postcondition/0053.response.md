Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, and either `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, or `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. Additionally, both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
