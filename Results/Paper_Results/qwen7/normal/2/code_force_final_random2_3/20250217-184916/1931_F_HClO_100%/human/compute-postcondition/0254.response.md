Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, and `p1` and `p2` will remain unchanged. The loop will break either when `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or when `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` is true. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both set (i.e., they are no longer negative), the loop will also break.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have reached the end of the range defined by `n - 1`. The values of `p1` and `p2` will not change throughout the loop's execution. The loop will exit based on one of the conditions specified within the loop body: either when `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, or when there is a mismatch between the elements at indices `i + p1` in `l1` and `i + p2` in `l2`. If during these checks, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set (indicating that certain conditions were met earlier in the loop), the loop will also terminate.
