Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is at least 5, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`, `_` is 4, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.**

In this step, the code initializes two variables `p1` and `p2` to 0. All other variables retain their initial states.
