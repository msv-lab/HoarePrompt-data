Output State: **`i` is increased by 1; `idx1` is equal to `i`; the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is checked within the if part of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `idx1` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is still checked within the if part of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.
