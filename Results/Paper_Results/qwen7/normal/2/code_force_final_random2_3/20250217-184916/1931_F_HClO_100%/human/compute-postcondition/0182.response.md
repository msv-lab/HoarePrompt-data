Output State: **`m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1, `val` is a list of tuples containing exactly `m - 2` tuples, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in the loop does not change the values of the variables `m` or `val`. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. The conditions and values of `m - 2` and `val` remain the same as they were before the loop started, with the additional condition that `m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run at least once. The list `val` will contain exactly `m - 2` tuples as it accumulates one tuple per iteration.
