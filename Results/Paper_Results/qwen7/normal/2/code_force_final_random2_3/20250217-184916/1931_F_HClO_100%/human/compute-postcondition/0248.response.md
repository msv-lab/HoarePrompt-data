Output State: **Postcondition: `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, and `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. We break out of the loop or if statement we were inside.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or the innermost enclosing `if` statement. Since the values of `n`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `l1`, `a2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` are not modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop or the `if` statement is exited.
