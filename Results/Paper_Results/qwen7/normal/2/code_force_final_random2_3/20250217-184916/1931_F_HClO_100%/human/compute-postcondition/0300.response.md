Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing all the remaining integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the first integer to `a3`. The rest of the integers are collected into a list `l3`. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.
