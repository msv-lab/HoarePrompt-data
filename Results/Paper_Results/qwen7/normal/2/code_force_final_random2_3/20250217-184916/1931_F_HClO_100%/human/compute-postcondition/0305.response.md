Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `range(m - 2)` part. This means the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body (as indicated by the comment `# the loop body is omit`), but the loop itself depends on the value of `m`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `a3` is an integer from the input.
   - `l3` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `val` is a list containing two tuples (`a3`, `l3`).
   - `m` must be greater than 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs `m - 2` times. This means if `m` was initially some value, after each iteration, `m` is effectively decremented by 1 until it reaches 2 (since `m - 2` iterations mean `m` goes from its initial value to 2).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 2. Since the loop runs `m - 2` times, after each iteration, `m` is decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `m` should be 2 more than its value at the start of the current iteration.

5. **Final state adjustment**: At the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be greater than 1. After one more iteration, `m` will be decremented by 1, so it must be greater than 2 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples (`a3`, `l3`), `m` must be greater than 2**
