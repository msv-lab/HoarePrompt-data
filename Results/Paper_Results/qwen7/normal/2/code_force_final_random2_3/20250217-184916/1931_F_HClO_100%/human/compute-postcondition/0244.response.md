Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx2` is `i`, and `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. Since `i` was previously `n - 1`, `idx2` now holds the value `n - 1`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2`) remain unchanged. The condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not directly affected by this assignment, so it remains part of the precondition.
