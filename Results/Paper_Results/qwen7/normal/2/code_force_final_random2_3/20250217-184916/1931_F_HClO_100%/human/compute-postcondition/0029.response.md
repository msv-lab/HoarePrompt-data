Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain as they were before the statement was executed.
