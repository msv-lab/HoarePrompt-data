Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the information:

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an integer input from the first split.
- `m` is greater than 5.
- `a1` is the first integer from the input split.
- `a2` is the second integer from the input split.
- `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`.
- `l11` is a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`.
- `_` is 4.
- A new string input is taken but its value is not assigned to any variable.

The key point here is the print statement:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
