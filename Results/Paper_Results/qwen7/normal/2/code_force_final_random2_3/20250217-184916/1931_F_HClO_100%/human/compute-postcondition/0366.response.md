Postcondition: **`val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces. After the if-else block executes, either `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` remains `-1`, or `idx2` is set to `i` and `idx1` remains `-1`. Additionally, `p1` and `p2` are updated accordingly: if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `p1` becomes `1` and `p2` remains `0`; otherwise, `p1` remains `0` and `p2` becomes `1`.**
