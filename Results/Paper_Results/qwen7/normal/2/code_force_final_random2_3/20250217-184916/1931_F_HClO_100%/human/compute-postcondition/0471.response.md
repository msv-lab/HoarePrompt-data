Output State: **All conditions within the loop are satisfied, and the final output is 'yes'.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `val` contains a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers. For each tuple, `l3` is exactly the list of all elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3`. The `else` block of the loop ensures that if any `l3` does not meet this condition, the loop would have broken out earlier. Since no break occurred, all conditions were satisfied, and the final output is 'yes'.
