Output State: **Postcondition: `m` must be at least 4, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations. If `l3` is not equal to a list of elements from `l` excluding `a3` for any iteration, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `m` will still be at least 4 since the loop runs `m-2` times. The list `val` will contain tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations. For each of these iterations, if `l3` does not match the list of elements from `l` excluding `a3`, the loop will break out of the innermost loop or if statement at that point. If no such condition causes a break, the loop will complete all `m-2` iterations without breaking, and the final state will satisfy the given postconditions.
