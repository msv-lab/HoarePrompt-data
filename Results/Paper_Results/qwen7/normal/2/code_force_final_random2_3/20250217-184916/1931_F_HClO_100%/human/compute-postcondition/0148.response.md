Output State: **`m` must be at least 4, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or the most internal if statement we are currently inside. Since the initial state includes that `m` must be at least 4 and `val` is a list of tuples for `m-2` iterations, these conditions remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop or if statement is exited.
