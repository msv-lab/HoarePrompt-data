Postcondition: **`val` is either an empty list or a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`. `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input. `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer minus 1 if the if condition is false, otherwise it remains the same. `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1 based on the last comparison inside the loop.**
