Output State: **`m` must be at least 2, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. The first element is assigned to `a3`, and the rest are collected into a list `l3`. The precondition that `m` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
