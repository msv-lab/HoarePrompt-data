Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `a3` and `l3`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`. This means that `l3` should contain all elements from `l` except for `a3`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `val` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`.
   - The length of `val` is exactly `m - 2`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `val` is a list of tuples, and the loop iterates over each tuple `(a3, l3)`, the next tuple in `val` will be used in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `a3` will be the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` will be the second element of the next tuple in `val`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The length of `val` remains the same, which is `m - 2`.
   - `a3` becomes the first element of the next tuple in `val`.
   - `l3` becomes the second element of the next tuple in `val`.

Given this information, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`val` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`, and the length of `val` is exactly `m - 2`. At the start of the next iteration, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`.**
