The only objects in the loop head are `_` (which is a dummy variable) and `val`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `val`. For the loop to execute again, `val` must contain at least `m - 1` tuples because it already had `m - 2` tuples at the end of the previous iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `val` must contain at least `m - 2` tuples. For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must contain at least `m - 1` tuples.

State: **`m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1, val is a list of tuples that must contain at least `m - 1` tuples**
