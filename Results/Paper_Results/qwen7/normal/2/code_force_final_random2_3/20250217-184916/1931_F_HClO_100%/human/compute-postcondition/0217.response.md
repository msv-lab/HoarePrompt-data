Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` plus the maximum value between `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, and in this case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Additionally, either the elements at index `i + p1` in list `l1` and index `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal, or the if condition is not met, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
