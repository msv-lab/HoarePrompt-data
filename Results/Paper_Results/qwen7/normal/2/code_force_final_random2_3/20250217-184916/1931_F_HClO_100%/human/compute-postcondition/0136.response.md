Output State: **`m` must be at least 3, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input, `val` is a list containing a tuple of (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. The values of `m` and `a3` remain unchanged, and `l3` remains the same list of integers. The list `val` now contains one additional element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`.
