Output State: **`m` is reduced by 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations, `t` is `t-1`, `a1` is the first integer input, `l1` is a list of integers which are the remaining inputs after the first one, `a2` is the second integer input by the user, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user. The first integer is assigned to `a2`, and the rest are collected into a list `l2`. The initial states of other variables remain unchanged.
