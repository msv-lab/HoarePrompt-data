Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `val` is an empty list or a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`.
- `a3` is an integer from the input.
- `l3` is a list of integers from the input.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `m` is the input integer minus 1 if the if condition is false, otherwise it remains the same.
- `t` is 0.
- `a1` is an integer from the input.
- `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`.
- `a2` is an integer from the input.
- `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.
- `idx1` is `n - 2`.
- `idx2` is `n - 2`.
- `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1 based on the last comparison inside the loop.

### Loop Statement:
```
for _ in range(m - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs for `m - 2` iterations.
- The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable, so we don't need to worry about its initial value.
- The loop head does not directly depend on `val`, `a3`, `l3`, `t`, `a1`, `l22`, `a2`, `l2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2`.

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- The only variables in the loop head are `m` and the loop counter `_`.

### Determining the Adjustments:
- For the loop to execute, `m - 2` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
- Therefore, `m` must be at least 2.

### Final State Adjustment:
- We need to ensure that `m` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` must be at least 2**
