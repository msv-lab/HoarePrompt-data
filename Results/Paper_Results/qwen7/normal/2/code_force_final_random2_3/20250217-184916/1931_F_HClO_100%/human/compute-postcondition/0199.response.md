Postcondition: `n` must be at least 1, `i` plus the maximum value between `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, and in this case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Additionally, the elements at index `i + p1` in list `l1` and index `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal. The current value of `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`.
