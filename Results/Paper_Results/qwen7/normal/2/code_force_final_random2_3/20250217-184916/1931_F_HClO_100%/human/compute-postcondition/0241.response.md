Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
