Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing all the remaining integers from the input split, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. The values of `a3` and `l3` remain unchanged, and `val` now contains one additional element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`.
