Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations without breaking out of the `else` block, meaning that for every tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, the condition `l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]` holds true.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `val` contains a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers. For each tuple, `l3` is exactly the list of all elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3`. The `else` block of the loop ensures that if any `l3` does not meet this condition, the loop would have broken out earlier. Since no break occurred, all conditions were satisfied, and the final output is 'yes'.
