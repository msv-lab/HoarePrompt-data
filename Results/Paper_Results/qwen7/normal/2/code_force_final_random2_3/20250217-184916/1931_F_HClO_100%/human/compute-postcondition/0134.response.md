Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m - 2)`. The variables involved here are `m` and the loop variable `_`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - The loop variable `_` is not explicitly given a starting value in the loop head, but it will start from 0 and increment until it reaches `m - 2`.
   - The value of `m` is not directly mentioned in the initial state, but it is used to determine how many times the loop will run.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since the loop runs `m - 2` times, `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute (because `range(m - 2)` will run from 0 to `m - 3`, meaning `m - 2` iterations).
   - The loop variable `_` will start at 0 and increment each time through the loop.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `m` is at least 3 so that the loop can execute.
   - The loop variable `_` will start at 0 and increment, but its initial value is not relevant since it starts at 0 by default.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `m` must be at least 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be at least 3**
