Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`**.

Explanation: The code initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to the current value of `i`. Since `i` was already incremented before this line, both `idx1` and `idx2` now hold the value of `i + 1`. The conditions and values of `n`, `p1`, `p2`, and the break statement remain unchanged.
