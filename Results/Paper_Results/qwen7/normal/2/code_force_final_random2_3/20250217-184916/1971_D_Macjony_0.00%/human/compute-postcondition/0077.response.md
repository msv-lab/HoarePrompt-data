Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string with its length greater than 3, `count` is either 4 or remains 3, `flag` is True, and `j` is 3. If `s[3]` equals '0' and `s[4]` equals '1', then `j` remains 3. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, and `j` remain unchanged.
