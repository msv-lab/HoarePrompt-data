Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 3, `s` is the new input string, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 4. If the character at position `j` in the string `s` is '0' and the character at position `j + 1` is '1', then `flag` remains True and `j` remains 4. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, and `j` remain unchanged.
