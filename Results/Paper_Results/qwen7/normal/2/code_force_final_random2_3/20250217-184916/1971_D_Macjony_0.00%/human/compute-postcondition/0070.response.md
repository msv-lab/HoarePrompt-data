Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j < len(s) - 1`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` is a new input string with its length greater than 3.
   - `count` is 3.
   - `flag` is True.
   - `j` is increased by 1 (implying `j` was `1` before the increment).

3. **Check the loop condition with the current state**:
   - The current value of `j` is `2` (since it was `1` before the increment).
   - The length of `s` is greater than 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(s) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `j` is currently `2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(s)` must be greater than `3` (which it already is) and `j` must be less than `len(s) - 1`.
   - Therefore, `len(s)` must be greater than `3` and `j` must be less than `len(s) - 1`.

Given these considerations, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(s)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string with its length greater than 3, `count` is 3, `flag` is True, `j` is 2 and `len(s)` must be greater than 3**
