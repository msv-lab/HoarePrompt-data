Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string with its length greater than 3, `count` is 1, `flag` is False, and `j` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1.**

Explanation: The line `flag = False` changes the value of the variable `flag` from `True` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
