Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `s` is a string input from the user, `s` is updated with the new input string, if `s` contains more than one '1', `a` remains 'TRIANGLE' if it was previously 'TRIANGLE', otherwise `a` becomes 0, and `b` remains 'SQUARE'.
