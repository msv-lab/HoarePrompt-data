Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string, 'SQUARE', or 'TRIANGLE', `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the input string provided by the user. If the input string `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` becomes 'TRIANGLE'. If `s` contains more than one '1', `t` remains unchanged.
