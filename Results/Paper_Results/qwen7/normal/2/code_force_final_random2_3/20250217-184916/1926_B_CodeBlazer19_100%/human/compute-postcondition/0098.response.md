Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the input string provided by the user, and the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1 if `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, the count of '1' in `s` is either greater than 1 or not equal to 1.
