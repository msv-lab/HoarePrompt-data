Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0.
   - `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `s` holds the last input string provided.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < t`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged.

5. **Other variables**:
   - `a`, `b`, `n`, `j`, and `s` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain the same.

Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n-1`, and `s` holds the last input string provided.**
