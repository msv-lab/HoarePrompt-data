Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0.
   - `b` is 'SQUARE'.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `s` is the final input string provided.
   - If `a` is not 0, the program does not change any variables. If `a` is 0, the program does not change any variables either.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.
   - The other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `j`, `s`) are not part of the loop head and thus remain unchanged.

5. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `t` is still an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0.
   - `b` is 'SQUARE'.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `s` is the final input string provided.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the final input string provided**.
