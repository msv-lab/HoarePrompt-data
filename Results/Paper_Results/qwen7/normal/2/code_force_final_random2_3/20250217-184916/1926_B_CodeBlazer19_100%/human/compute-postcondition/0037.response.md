Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n-1`, and `s` holds the last input string provided. The current value of `a` is not 0.**
