Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is either '' or 'SQUARE', `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n`, `s` is the last input string provided, and `s` is updated to the new input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes a new input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `s` is the input provided by the user.
