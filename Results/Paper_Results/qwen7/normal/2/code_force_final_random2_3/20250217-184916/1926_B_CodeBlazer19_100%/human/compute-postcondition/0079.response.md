Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0. In this case, it is explicitly stated that `a` is 0.
- `b` is 'SQUARE'.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `s` is the final input string provided.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(b)
```

Since `b` is explicitly defined as 'SQUARE', the print statement will output 'SQUARE'.

Output: **'SQUARE'**
