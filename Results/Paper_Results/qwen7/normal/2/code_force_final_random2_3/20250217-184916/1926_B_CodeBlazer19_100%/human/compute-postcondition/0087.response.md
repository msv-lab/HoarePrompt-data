Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the input string provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `s`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
