Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n`, `s` is the last input string provided, and `s` is updated to the new input string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` remains unchanged and `b` remains 'SQUARE'.
