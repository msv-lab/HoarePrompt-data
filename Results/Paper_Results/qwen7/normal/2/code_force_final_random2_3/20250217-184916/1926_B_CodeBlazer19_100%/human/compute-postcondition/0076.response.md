Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0.
- `b` is 'SQUARE'.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `s` is the final input string provided.
- `a` is not 0.

Given that `a` is not 0, it must be 'TRIANGLE'. 

Therefore, the `print(a)` statement will print the string 'TRIANGLE'.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
