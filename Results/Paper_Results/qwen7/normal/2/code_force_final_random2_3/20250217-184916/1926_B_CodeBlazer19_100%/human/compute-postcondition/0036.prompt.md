Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    s = input()
    if s.count('1') == 1:
        a = 'TRIANGLE'
    elif s.count('1') > 1:
        b = 'SQUARE'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `s` has either exactly one occurrence of the character '1' (in which case `a` is 'TRIANGLE') or more than one or no such occurrence (in which case `a` is 0 and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string').

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `s` is a string input from the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains 'SQUARE', `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `s` is a string input from the user, `s` is updated with the new input string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
