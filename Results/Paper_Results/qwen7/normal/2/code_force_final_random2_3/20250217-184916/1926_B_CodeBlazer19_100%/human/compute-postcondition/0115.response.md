Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string, 'SQUARE', or 'TRIANGLE', `n` is 0, `j` is -1, `s` is the last input string provided by the user. After all iterations of the loop, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' if any of the input strings contain exactly one '1'. The variable `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings contain more than one '1'. The loop terminates when `j` becomes -1, which happens when `n` reaches 0.
