Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100, i is 99, a is 'TRIANGLE' if any of the strings s entered during the loop iterations contained exactly one '1', otherwise a is 0, b is 'SQUARE' if any of the strings s entered during the loop iterations contained more than one '1', otherwise b remains an empty string, n is the total number of inputs provided by the user over all iterations, j is 0, and s is the last input string provided by the user.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., from 0 to 99), the variable `i` will be set to 99. The variables `a` and `b` will retain their final values based on the conditions met during all the iterations. Specifically, `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' if any string `s` contained exactly one '1' at least once during the entire loop execution, and `b` will be 'SQUARE' if any string `s` contained more than one '1' at least once during the entire loop execution. The variable `n` will hold the total number of inputs provided by the user across all iterations, and `j` will be reset to 0 since it is reinitialized at the start of each iteration. The variable `s` will contain the last input string provided by the user during the final iteration.
