Output State: `i` is `n-1`; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list starting with 1000, followed by `n-1` elements where each element is calculated as `1000 - sum of the first `i` elements in `T`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1` (since the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`). The list `a` will start with the initial value of 1000, and each subsequent element will be 1000 minus the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from the list `T`.
