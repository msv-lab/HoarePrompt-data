Output State: **`a` is updated such that its last element is now the value of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a`, which is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains valid.
