Output State: **The list `a` is reversed, meaning the first element is now the last element of the original list, which is `1000 - T[n-1]`, and the last element is now the first element of the original list, which is `1000`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` remains unchanged.**

To elaborate:
- Initially, `a` is a list starting with 1000 followed by `n-1` elements, each calculated as `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.
- After reversing the list `a` using `a = a[::-1]`, the first element of `a` becomes `1000 - T[n-1]` and the last element becomes `1000`.
- The variable `i` is set to `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged from its initial state.
