Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `line` is an input string
   - `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` by spaces and converting each element to an integer
   - `a` is a list containing the values 1000, `a[0] - T[0]`, and `a` is appended with the value of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]` where `i` is `n - 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), so `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been `n-1` because the loop increments `i` by `1` each time it runs.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by `1` again, so `i` will become `n`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than `0`, it remains unchanged.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `t` remains `0` as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains greater than `0` as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `line` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `T` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `a` will be updated according to the loop logic, but since we are only asked to adjust the loop head variables, we don't need to update `a` here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `line` is an input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the values 1000, `a[0] - T[0]`, and `a` is appended with the value of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]` where `i` is `n - 1`**.
