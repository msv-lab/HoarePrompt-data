Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `line` remains as the input string, `T` remains as the list of integers obtained from splitting `line` by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list starting with the value 1000 followed by `n-1` elements, each being the difference between the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`, and `a` is reversed.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. Since `a` initially contains the value 1000 followed by `n-1` elements (each calculated as `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`), reversing it means the first element of the original list (which was 1000) will now be the last element in the reversed list, and the last element (which was the result of the last calculation `a[n-2] - T[n-2]`) will now be the first element in the reversed list.

Thus, the final state of `a` is the reversed version of its original state. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `line`, and `T`) remain unchanged.
