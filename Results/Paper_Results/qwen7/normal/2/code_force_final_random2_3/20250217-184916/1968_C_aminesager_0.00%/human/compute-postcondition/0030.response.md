Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` contains an element that is equal to `a[2] - T[2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `a[i - 1]` evaluates to `a[2]`, and `T[i - 1]` evaluates to `T[2]`. Therefore, `a` now contains an element that is the result of `a[2] - T[2]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
