The loop condition is `t`, which is a single variable. Therefore, we can only adjust `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is joined into a string with each element separated by a space, and `i` is equal to `n`. This information does not directly affect the loop condition `t`. The loop will continue as long as `t` is true.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be true. Since no specific value for `t` was given, we assume `t` was true at the end of the previous iteration. To guarantee the loop can run again, `t` should remain true.

State: **`t` must be true**
