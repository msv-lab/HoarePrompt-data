### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_1` aligns with the rules and objectives of the game as described in the problem statement.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Game Rules Compliance**:
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number.
   - Sasha concatenates two chosen numbers and removes one from the list.
   - The game ends when only one number remains, and Sasha wins if this number is at least \(10^m\).

2. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function calculates the total length of the string representations of all numbers in the list.
   - It sorts the counts of trailing zeros in each number in descending order.
   - It then subtracts every second element from this sorted list starting from the first element.
   - The final result is compared against \(m + 1\). If the result is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

#### Analysis:
- **Total Length Calculation**: This step correctly sums up the lengths of all numbers, which is relevant for understanding the overall size of the remaining numbers after Anna's moves.
- **Trailing Zeros Counting**: The `zerocnts` function correctly counts trailing zeros in a number, which is used to sort the numbers in `func_1`.
- **Subtraction of Every Second Element**: This step is designed to simulate the alternating turns of the game. By subtracting every second largest number, it effectively simulates the process where Anna and Sasha take turns, and the remaining numbers are adjusted accordingly.
- **Final Comparison**: The comparison against \(m + 1\) ensures that the final number is checked against the winning condition.

Given that the logic in `func_1` accurately models the game's rules and the provided examples match the expected outcomes, the implementation appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
