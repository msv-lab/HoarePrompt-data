Postcondition: `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, and `tot` is 1. If the character at position `i` in `num` is not '0', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at position `i` in `num` is '0', no change occurs to `tot`.
