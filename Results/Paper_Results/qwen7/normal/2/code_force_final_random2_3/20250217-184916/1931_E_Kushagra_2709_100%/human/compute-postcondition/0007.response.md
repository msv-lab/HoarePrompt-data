Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, `tot` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `tot` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which was presumably 0 before this line of code). The value of `num` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
