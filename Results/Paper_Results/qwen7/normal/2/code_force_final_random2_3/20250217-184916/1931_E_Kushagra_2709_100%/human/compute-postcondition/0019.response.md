Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is 0, `tot` is the length of `num`.

Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `i` until it encounters a character in `num` that is not '0'. Since the loop increments `tot` each time it iterates without breaking, `tot` will count the number of trailing zeros in `num`. Once `i` reaches 0 (meaning there are no more characters left to check), the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 0, and `tot` will be equal to the total number of trailing zeros in `num`.
