### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided functions and the annotated code to determine if they correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement.

#### Function `zerocnts`:
This function counts the number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of a number. It works as expected, but it does not contribute to the game logic directly. The function is used within `func_1` to help determine the state of the game.

#### Function `func_1`:
The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `nums`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what it does:

1. **Calculate Total Length of Numbers**:
   ```python
   tot = sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))
   ```
   This calculates the total number of digits in all the numbers combined.

2. **Count Trailing Zeros**:
   ```python
   cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
   ```
   This creates a list of the number of trailing zeros for each number in `nums`, sorted in descending order.

3. **Adjust Total Length**:
   ```python
   for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
       tot -= cntvals[i]
   ```
   This loop subtracts the number of trailing zeros from the total length in a specific pattern. It subtracts every second element in `cntvals` starting from the first element.

4. **Determine Winner**:
   ```python
   return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
   ```
   The function returns 'Sasha' if the adjusted total length (`tot`) is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.

#### Analysis:
1. **Game Logic**:
   - The function does not simulate the actual game process where Anna and Sasha take turns.
   - It does not account for the strategic decisions made by each player during their turns.
   - The logic of subtracting every second element from the total length of digits does not align with the game rules.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - The problem requires optimal play from both players, but the function does not consider the optimal moves that would lead to a win.
   - The function's approach is not based on the game logic, making it incorrect.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - Consider the example provided in the original assessment: `n = 2`, `m = 2`, `nums = [14, 2]`.
   - Anna can reverse `2` to `2`, and Sasha can concatenate `2` and `14` to form `214`. Since `214` is greater than `100`, Sasha wins.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not simulate this process and instead uses a different approach that does not reflect the game logic.

Given these observations, the provided functions do not correctly implement the game logic and do not account for the optimal play required by the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game logic properly and does not account for the optimal moves required by the problem statement.
