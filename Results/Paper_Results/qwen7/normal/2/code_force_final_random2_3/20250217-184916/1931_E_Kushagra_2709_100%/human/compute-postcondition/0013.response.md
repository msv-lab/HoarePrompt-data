Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(num) - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.
   - `i` is `len(num) - 2`.
   - `tot` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(num) - 1` to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts from `len(num) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` should be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len(num) - 3`.
   - The value of `len(num) - 1` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `num` remains the same.
   - `i` changes from `len(num) - 2` to `len(num) - 3`.
   - `tot` remains 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is len(num) - 3, `tot` is 2**
