Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(num) - 1, -1, -1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(num) - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The variable `i` will take on values starting from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`.
   - The length of `num` (`len(num)`) is a constant derived from the initial state of `num`.

4. **Initial state of relevant variables**:
   - `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.
   - `tot` is `0`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` will start from `len(num) - 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `len(num) - 1` initially.
   - The length of `num` should be correctly set based on the initial value of `num`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to `len(num) - 1`.
- `num` should be a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**.
