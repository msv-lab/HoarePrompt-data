Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `zerocnts` do not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not accurately simulate the game process and does not consider the optimal moves for both players.

Here are the key issues:
1. **Game Logic Implementation**: The function `func_1` does not simulate the actual game process where Anna and Sasha take turns. Instead, it attempts to calculate something related to the number of zeros in the digits of the numbers, which is not relevant to the game rules.
2. **Optimal Play Consideration**: The problem requires optimal play from both players, but the provided functions do not account for strategic decisions that would lead to either player winning based on the remaining numbers after each turn.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:
- Input: `n = 2`, `m = 2`, `nums = [14, 2]`
- According to the problem, Anna can reverse the integer `2` to `2`, and then Sasha can concatenate `2` and `14` to form `214`. Since `214` is greater than `100`, Sasha wins.
- However, the provided function `func_1` does not simulate this process and instead uses a different approach that does not reflect the game logic.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and thus is incorrect.
