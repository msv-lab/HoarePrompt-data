### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if it's possible to select exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from each of the two arrays \( a \) and \( b \) such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the chosen elements.

2. **Key Conditions**:
   - We need to ensure that there are enough distinct elements in both arrays to cover all integers from 1 to \( k \).
   - Specifically, we need at least \( \frac{k}{2} \) unique elements from each array that are within the range [1, k].

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly initializes the necessary variables and sets.
   - It calculates the unique elements in both arrays that are within the range [1, k].
   - It then checks if the number of unique elements in each array that are within the range [1, k] exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \).
   - If the number of unique elements in either array exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \), it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It also checks if the total number of unique elements across both arrays is at least \( k \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the number of unique elements in either array is too large or the total number of unique elements is insufficient.
   - The logic ensures that the conditions for selecting elements are met.

5. **Output**:
   - The function correctly appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list based on the conditions checked.
   - The final results list contains the correct answers for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose the required elements from both arrays. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
