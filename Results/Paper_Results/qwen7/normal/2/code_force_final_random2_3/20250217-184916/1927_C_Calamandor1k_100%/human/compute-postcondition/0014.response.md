Output State: **`results` is a list containing 'NO', 'NO', `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements common to `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` adds the string `'NO'` to the end of the list `results`. Initially, `results` contained only `'NO'`. After appending `'NO'`, `results` now contains two `'NO'` strings. The values of `t`, `unique_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` remain unchanged from their initial states.
