Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, m, k) representing the lengths of arrays `a` and `b`, and the number of elements to be chosen, respectively. The function processes each test case in the `cases` list, checks specific conditions related to the elements in arrays `a` and `b`, and appends either 'YES' or 'NO' to the `results` list based on these conditions. The function returns the `results` list, which contains the outcome ('YES' or 'NO') for each test case.**
