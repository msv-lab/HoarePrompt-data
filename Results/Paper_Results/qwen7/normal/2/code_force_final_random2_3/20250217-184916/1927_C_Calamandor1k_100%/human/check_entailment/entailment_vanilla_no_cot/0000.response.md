Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays \(a\) and \(b\) such that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Set Operations**: 
   - It creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to \(k\).
   - It further divides the filtered elements into those exclusive to `a` (`only_a`), exclusive to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).

3. **Validation**:
   - It checks if the number of elements exclusive to `a` or `b` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\). If so, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It calculates the total number of distinct elements across `a` and `b`. If this total is less than \(k\), it returns 'NO'.
   - If none of the above conditions fail, it concludes that it is possible to choose the required elements and returns 'YES'.

The logic implemented in the `func_1` function accurately follows the problem statement and constraints, ensuring the program works as expected for the given examples and any valid inputs within the specified ranges.
