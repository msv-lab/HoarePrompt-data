Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and initializes an empty list `cases` to store the details of each test case.
2. It iterates through each test case, extracting the necessary information (n, m, k, a, b) and appending them to the `cases` list.
3. The main logic is contained within the `func_1` function, which processes each test case individually.
4. For each test case, the function:
   - Creates sets of unique elements from arrays `a` and `b`.
   - Filters out elements greater than `k` to get `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
   - Determines the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`), unique to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).
   - Checks if the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
   - Calculates the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If this total is less than `k`, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'YES' to the results list.
5. The function returns the `results` list containing the outcomes for each test case.
6. The program then prints the results for each test case.

Given the logical steps and the conditions checked, the program appears to correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
