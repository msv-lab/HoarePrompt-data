You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine if it's possible to select exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from each of two arrays `a` and `b` such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the chosen elements.

2. **Key Steps in the Program**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it processes the arrays `a` and `b` along with the value of \( k \).
   - It uses sets to identify unique elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to \( k \).
   - It then categorizes these elements into those exclusive to `a`, exclusive to `b`, and common to both.
   - It checks if the count of elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to \( k \) can cover all integers from 1 to \( k \).

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies unique elements in `a` and `b` that are within the range [1, k].
   - It then checks if there are enough elements in `a` and `b` to cover all numbers from 1 to \( k \).
   - The logic for determining if it's possible to choose the required elements is sound. Specifically:
     - If the number of elements exclusive to `a` or `b` exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \), it returns 'NO'.
     - If the total distinct elements (from both `a` and `b`) are less than \( k \), it returns 'NO'.
     - Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where there might be no elements in either array that are within the range [1, k].
   - The program also correctly handles cases where the number of elements in one array exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose the required elements from both arrays.

Correctness: **True**
