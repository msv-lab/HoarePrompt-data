Output State: **`unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from `b` and now also includes elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` list now contains 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'; `k` remains unchanged; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from `a`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set of elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_b` is a set of elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`; `both` is a set of elements that are common between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `total_distinct` is recalculated as the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to continue the loop without executing the remaining part of the loop body. Since no changes are made to any variables or the state of the program when `continue` is executed, all the previous conditions and values remain unchanged.
