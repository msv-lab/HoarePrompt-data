Output State: **`unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, `results` list now contains 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', `k` remains unchanged, `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set of elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `relevant_b` is updated to be the set of elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_b` is a set of elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set of elements that are common between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `a` is updated to the next value in the `cases` list, `b` is updated to the next value in the `cases` list, `both` is the intersection of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, and the results list has 'NO' appended to it.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to continue to the next iteration of the loop without executing the remaining part of the current iteration. Since no specific operations are performed in the current iteration, all the variables retain their previous states. The `results` list has 'NO' appended to it, indicating that the current iteration did not meet the condition being checked.
