Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from input split by spaces.
- `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.
- The current value of `b` is less than or equal to `a`.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(a * n)` executes.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Since `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the expression `b - a` results in a non-positive value (either zero or negative).
2. Therefore, `k`, which is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`, will be `b - a` because it is the smaller value between `n` (which is a positive integer) and a non-positive value (`b - a`).

However, the value of `k` does not affect the execution of `print(a * n)` directly. The only relevant variables for the print statement are `a` and `n`.

Since `a` and `n` are integers obtained from input, their exact values are not specified in the initial state. But we know they are valid integers.

Therefore, the print statement will output the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n**
