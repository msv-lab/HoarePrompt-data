You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a specified number of test cases (determined by user input). For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). It then calculates and prints a result based on the relationship between \( a \) and \( b \). If \( b \leq a \), it prints \( a \times n \). Otherwise, it computes and prints \( b \times k - k \times (k - 1) / 2 + (n - k) \times a \), where \( k \) is the minimum of \( n \) and \( b - a \). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the given program to determine if it correctly implements the logic to maximize Bob's profit.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Key Logic:**
   - The goal is to find the value of `k` (where \(0 \le k \le \min(n, b-a)\)) that maximizes the profit.
   - If `b <= a`, then selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal.
   - Otherwise, we need to calculate the profit for different values of `k` and choose the one that gives the maximum profit.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - For a given `k`, the profit from selling the first `k` buns at prices `(b-k+1), (b-k+2), ..., b` is:
     \[
     \text{Profit from first } k \text{ buns} = b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + (b-k+1) = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (b-i) = bk - \frac{k(k-1)}{2}
     \]
   - The profit from selling the remaining `(n-k)` buns at the usual price `a` is:
     \[
     \text{Profit from remaining } (n-k) \text{ buns} = (n-k) \cdot a
     \]
   - Therefore, the total profit for a given `k` is:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = bk - \frac{k(k-1)}{2} + (n-k) \cdot a
     \]

4. **Optimization:**
   - The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b-a)`. This is because selling more than `b-a` buns at the modified price would not make sense since the usual price `a` is higher.
   - It then checks if `b <= a`. If true, it prints `a * n` (all buns sold at the usual price).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit for `k = min(n, b-a)` and prints it.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1:** `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - Optimal `k = 1`: 
    - Profit from first bun: 5
    - Profit from next 3 buns: 4 * 3 = 12
    - Total profit: 5 + 12 = 17
  - Program output: 17 (Correct)

- **Example 2:** `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Optimal `k = 5`: 
    - Profit from first 5 buns: 9 * 5 - (5 * 4) / 2 = 45 - 10 = 35
  - Program output: 35 (Correct)

- **Example 3:** `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - Optimal `k = 0`: 
    - All buns sold at usual price: 10 * 10 = 100
  - Program output: 100 (Correct)

- **Example 4:** `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Optimal `k = 5`: 
    - Profit from first 5 buns: 11 * 5 - (5 * 4) / 2 = 55 - 10 = 45
  - Program output: 45 (Correct)

- **Example 5:** `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
  - Optimal `k = 0`: 
    - All buns sold at usual price: 1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000
  - Program output: 1000000000000000000 (Correct)

- **Example 6:** `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
  - Optimal `k = 0`: 
    - All buns sold at usual price: 1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000
  - Program output: 1000000000000000000 (Correct)

- **Example 7:** `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
  - Optimal `k = 1000`: 
    - Profit from first 1000 buns: 1000 * 1000 - (1000 * 999) / 2 = 1000000 - 499500 = 500500
  - Program output: 500500 (Correct)

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize Bob's profit based on the given conditions and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
