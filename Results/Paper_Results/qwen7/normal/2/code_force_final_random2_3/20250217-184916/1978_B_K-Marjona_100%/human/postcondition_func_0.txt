The function processes a specified number of test cases (determined by user input). For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). It then calculates and prints a result based on the relationship between \( a \) and \( b \). If \( b \leq a \), it prints \( a \times n \). Otherwise, it computes and prints \( b \times k - k \times (k - 1) / 2 + (n - k) \times a \), where \( k \) is the minimum of \( n \) and \( b - a \). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
