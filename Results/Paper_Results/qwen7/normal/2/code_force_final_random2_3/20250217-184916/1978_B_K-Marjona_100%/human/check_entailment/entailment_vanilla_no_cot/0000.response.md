Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to maximize Bob's profit based on the given conditions. Let's break down the solution:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Variable Initialization**: 
   - `n`: Number of buns.
   - `a`: Usual price of a bun.
   - `b`: Price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

3. **Choosing `k`**:
   - `k` is set to the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This ensures that `k` is within the valid range and helps in determining how many buns should be sold at the modified price.
   - If `b <= a`, it means there is no benefit in reducing the price, so all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b > a`, the program calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price `(b - i + 1)` for each `i` from 1 to `k`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The formula used to calculate the profit from the first `k` buns is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`, which is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`.

5. **Output**: The total profit is printed for each test case.

This logic correctly handles all the given examples and constraints, ensuring that the maximum profit is calculated accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
