Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was defined before the input operation and represents the number of test cases.
