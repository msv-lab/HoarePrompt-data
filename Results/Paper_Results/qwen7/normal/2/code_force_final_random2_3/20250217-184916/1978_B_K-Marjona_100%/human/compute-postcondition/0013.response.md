Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from input split by spaces.
   - `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
   ```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the expression inside the print statement:
- `b * k`: This term represents the product of `b` and `k`.
- `k * (k - 1) // 2`: This term calculates the sum of the first `k-1` integers, which is a triangular number.
- `(n - k) * a`: This term represents the product of `(n - k)` and `a`.

Combining these parts, the expression evaluates to:
\[ b \cdot k - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \]

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are determined by the input, and `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. Therefore, the expression will evaluate to a specific numerical value based on the input values.

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where b, n, a, and k are determined by the input)**
