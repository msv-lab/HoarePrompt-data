Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`**.

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input, splits them by spaces, and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The variable `t` is not affected by this operation and remains as `t - 1`. Additionally, the variable `k` is calculated as the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.
