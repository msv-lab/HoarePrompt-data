Output State: **t is 0, and there are no further values of n, a, and b as the loop has completed all its iterations. k retains its last computed value for each test case.**

In this final state, the variable `t` which represents the number of test cases has been decremented to 0 after all test cases have been processed. There are no more inputs for `n`, `a`, and `b` since the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `k` retains the value it had for the last test case processed, as it is re-computed for each test case independently within the loop.
