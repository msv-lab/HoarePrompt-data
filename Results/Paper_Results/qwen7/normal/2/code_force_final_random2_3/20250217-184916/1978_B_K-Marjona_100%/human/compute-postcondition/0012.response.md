Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from input split by spaces.
- `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a * n)`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are obtained from input, so their exact values are not known without additional information.
2. The expression `a * n` will be evaluated using the values of `a` and `n`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not specified, we cannot provide a precise numerical answer. However, we can describe the expression that will be printed.

Output: **a * n (where `a` and `n` are the values obtained from input)**
