Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**

Explanation: The code updates `k` to be the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables along with the updated value of `k`.
