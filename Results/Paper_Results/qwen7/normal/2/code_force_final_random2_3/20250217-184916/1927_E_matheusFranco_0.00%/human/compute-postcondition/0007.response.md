The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer - 1, which means `t` is now 0.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
