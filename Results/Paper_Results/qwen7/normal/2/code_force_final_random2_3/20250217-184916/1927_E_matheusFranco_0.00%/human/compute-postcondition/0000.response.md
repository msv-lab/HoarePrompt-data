Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input represents the number of test cases. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer remains valid, and no other variables are affected by this code.
