Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function constructs a permutation of length `n` where every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) is set to `i + 1` for all iterations `i` from `0` to `k-1`. This approach ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` in the constructed permutation will have a difference of at most 1. This is because the values in the permutation are incrementally increasing by `k` steps, ensuring that the sums of any `k` consecutive elements will be close to each other.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case. After processing all test cases, it correctly sets `t` to a non-positive integer (0 or negative). This function correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate `n` and `k` values.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, both `func_1` and `func_2` work together to generate a k-level permutation for each test case. The construction method in `func_1` guarantees that the resulting permutation meets the k-level condition, and `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
