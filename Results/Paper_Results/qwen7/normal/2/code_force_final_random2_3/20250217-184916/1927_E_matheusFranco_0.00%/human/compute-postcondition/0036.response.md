Output State: `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 4, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `2 * 2`-th element (starting from 2) is set to `2 + 1`, `curr_v` is 16, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 20.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `curr_v` and update the `multiples_of_k_plus_i` index in the `permutation` list until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than the length of the `permutation` list. Given the pattern, after 10 iterations (since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 2 and increments by 2 each iteration), `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be 20. At this point, the loop condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, `curr_v` will be incremented 10 times starting from 6, making it 16, and the `permutation` list will have its 20th index updated with the value `curr_v + 1`, which is 17. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
