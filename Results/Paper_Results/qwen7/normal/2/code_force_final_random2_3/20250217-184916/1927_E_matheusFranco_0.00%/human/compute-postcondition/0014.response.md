Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is updated to ensure it is less than `len(permutation) - k` and then incremented by `k`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`; `curr_v` is `curr_v + 1`.**

This means that:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is first adjusted to be less than `len(permutation) - k`.
- Then, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`.
- `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to the current value of `curr_v`.
- Finally, `curr_v` is incremented by 1.
