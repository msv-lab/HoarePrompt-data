Output State: `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 4, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `2 * 2`-th element (starting from 2) is set to the value from 5 up to `n` based on the iteration count, `curr_v` is 10, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 16.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `curr_v` and update the `multiples_of_k_plus_i`-th element in the `permutation` list until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches or exceeds the length of the `permutation` list. Given that the loop executed 3 times initially and each iteration increases `curr_v` by 1 and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k` (which is 2), we can calculate that the loop will execute a total of 8 times (since 14 + 2 = 16). Therefore, `curr_v` will be 10 (initial `curr_v` of 5 plus 5 more increments), and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be 16. All elements in the `permutation` list that are multiples of `2 * 2` starting from index 2 will be filled with values from 5 to 14.
