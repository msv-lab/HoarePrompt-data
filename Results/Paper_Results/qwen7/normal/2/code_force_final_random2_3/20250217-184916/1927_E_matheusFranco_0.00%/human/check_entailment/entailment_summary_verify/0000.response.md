### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to generate a k-level permutation of length n.
- A k-level permutation ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.
- The function `func_1` generates a permutation based on a specific pattern, and `func_2` handles multiple test cases.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function initializes an array `permutation` of size `n` with zeros.
- It uses a loop to fill the array in a specific pattern:
  - For each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, it places the value `curr_v` at positions `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and increments `curr_v`.
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is updated by adding `k` to it in each iteration.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement for `n = 4` and `k = 2`:
- Initial permutation: `[0, 0, 0, 0]`
- For `i = 0`: Place `1` at positions `0, 2` -> `[1, 0, 1, 0]`
- For `i = 1`: Place `2` at positions `1, 3` -> `[1, 2, 1, 2]`

The resulting permutation is `[1, 2, 1, 2]`.

Now, let's check the sums of continuous segments of length `k` (which is 2):
- Sum of segment `[1, 2]` is `1 + 2 = 3`.
- Sum of segment `[2, 1]` is `2 + 1 = 3`.
- Sum of segment `[1, 2]` is `1 + 2 = 3`.

The maximum sum is `3` and the minimum sum is `3`. The difference is `0`, which satisfies the condition `\max(s) - \min(s) \le 1`.

#### General Case Analysis:
- The pattern used in `func_1` ensures that the values placed in the permutation are incremented in a way that maintains the required property.
- Since `k` is even, the pattern will distribute the values in a balanced manner across the array, ensuring that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` do not differ by more than 1.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- `func_2` processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
- It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each one.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates a k-level permutation for all potential cases. The function `func_1` ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, as demonstrated by the example and the general case analysis.
