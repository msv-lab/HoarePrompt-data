The variables in the loop head are `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. At the end of the last iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been increased by `k`, `i` remains less than `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is increased by 2, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to `curr_v + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)` after the current iteration. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was increased by `k` in the previous iteration, it needs to be adjusted to ensure it is still less than `len(permutation)`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than `len(permutation)`.

State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`**
