Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 1, `permutation` is a list of n zeros, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `curr_v` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
    while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
        permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
        curr_v += 1
        multiples_of_k_plus_i += k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 4, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) is set to `i + 1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `curr_v` is 4, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be incremented until it is no longer less than the length of the `permutation` list. This means that the loop will stop once `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is equal to or greater than `len(permutation)`. At this point, `curr_v` will be equal to `k + 1` because it starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The `permutation` list will have its elements set according to the rule specified in the loop body, with every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) being set to `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 4, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `2 * 2`-th element (starting from 2) is set to `2 + 1`, `curr_v` is 16, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 20.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `curr_v` and update the `multiples_of_k_plus_i` index in the `permutation` list until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than the length of the `permutation` list. Given the pattern, after 10 iterations (since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 2 and increments by 2 each iteration), `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be 20. At this point, the loop condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, `curr_v` will be incremented 10 times starting from 6, making it 16, and the `permutation` list will have its 20th index updated with the value `curr_v + 1`, which is 17. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: All elements in `permutation` from index `i` to `i + (n-1)*k` (where `n` is the number of iterations the loop executed) will be filled with consecutive integers starting from `i`, and the remaining elements in `permutation` will remain unchanged.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will eventually become greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`. During each iteration, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to the current value of `curr_v`, which increments by 1 each time through the loop. The loop runs for as many times as necessary until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` exceeds the length of `permutation`. Therefore, the elements of `permutation` that are accessed and updated will form a sequence of consecutive integers starting from `i`, with a step size determined by `k`. The exact range of indices that get updated depends on the values of `i` and `k`, but it will cover all indices that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches before it exceeds the length of `permutation`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
