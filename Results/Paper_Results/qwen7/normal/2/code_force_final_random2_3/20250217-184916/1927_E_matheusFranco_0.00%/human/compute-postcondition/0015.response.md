The variables in the loop head are `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`. The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been updated to ensure it is less than `len(permutation) - k` and then incremented by `k`. This means `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is already less than `len(permutation)`, and the loop can certainly execute one more time without needing to adjust any other states.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is updated to ensure it is less than `len(permutation) - k` and then incremented by `k`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`; `curr_v` is `curr_v + 1`**
