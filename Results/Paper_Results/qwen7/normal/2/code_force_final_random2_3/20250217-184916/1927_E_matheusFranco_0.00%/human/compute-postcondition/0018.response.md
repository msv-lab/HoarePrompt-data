Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is updated to ensure it is less than `len(permutation) - k` and then incremented by `k`, and then `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is further incremented by `k`.**

Explanation: The code `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Before this increment, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was updated to ensure it is less than `len(permutation) - k`. After this increment, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is further incremented by `k`. Therefore, the final value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the result of these operations.
