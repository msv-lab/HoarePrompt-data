The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `k` is 2
- `idx` is 1
- `idx_v` is 4
- `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `2 * 2`-th element (starting from 2) is set to `2 + 1`
- `curr_v` is 6
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 4
- The second element of `permutation` is now 5

To determine the necessary adjustments:
1. The current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 4.
2. We need `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to be less than `len(permutation)` for the loop to continue.

Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is currently 4, it must be incremented to 5 for the loop to execute one more time. This means `multiples_of_k_plus_i` should be adjusted to 5.

No other states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head condition.

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 2, `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 4, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `2 * 2`-th element (starting from 2) is set to `2 + 1`, `curr_v` is 6, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 5, and the second element of `permutation` is now 5**
