Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now equal to `multiples_of_k_plus_i` + `k`.
   - `i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - `curr_v` is increased by 1.
   - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to `curr_v`.

3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop condition depends solely on `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than `len(permutation)` at the start of the next iteration.

Given the current state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has already been incremented by `k` (i.e., `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k`). Therefore, to ensure the loop executes again, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must still be less than `len(permutation)`.

Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has just been updated, we need to ensure that it remains within the bounds of the loop condition. The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than `len(permutation)`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `i` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to `curr_v`**.
