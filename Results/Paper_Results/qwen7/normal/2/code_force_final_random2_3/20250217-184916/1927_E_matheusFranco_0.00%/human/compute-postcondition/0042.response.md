Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now equal to `multiples_of_k_plus_i` + `k`, `i` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to `curr_v`.**

This means that the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been incremented by `k`, while the conditions and values of `i`, `curr_v`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` remain as described in the initial state, with `i` still being less than the length of `permutation` and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` being updated to the current value of `curr_v`.
