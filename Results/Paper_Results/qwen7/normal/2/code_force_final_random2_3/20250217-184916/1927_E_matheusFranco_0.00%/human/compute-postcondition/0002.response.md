Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no variable assignments or operations affecting `t` are shown), the precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the only information that needs to be included in the output state is that `t` must still be greater than 0.
