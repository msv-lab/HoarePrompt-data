Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`, `i` remains less than `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is increased by 2, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to `curr_v + 1`.**

This means that the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been incremented by `k`, while `i` still needs to be less than the length of `permutation`. The value of `curr_v` has been increased by 2, and the element in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been updated to the new value of `curr_v + 1`.
