#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The `count` list will contain the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`. Specifically, `count[0]` will hold the number of 'A's, `count[1]` will hold the number of 'B's, and so on up to `count[6]` holding the number of 'G's in the string `a`. The `n` and `m` variables will retain their initial values, which are such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 5\). The variable `a` will also remain unchanged as it is the input string over which the loop iterates.
    #
    #In summary, the final `count` list will represent the frequency of each character in the input string `a`, while `n`, `m`, and `a` will stay the same as they were initially.
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
        
    #State: After the loop executes all 7 iterations, `i` will be 6, `n` must be greater than 6, and `needed_problems` will be equal to `7 * (m - min(count))` if any `count[i] < m`. If all `count[i]` are greater than or equal to `m`, then `needed_problems` will be 0.
    return needed_problems
    #The program returns needed_problems which is calculated as 7 times the difference between m and the minimum count of problems solved in any of the 7 iterations, if any count[i] is less than m. If all count[i] are greater than or equal to m, then needed_problems is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 50), `m` (an integer between 1 and 5), and `a` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). It calculates and returns `needed_problems`, which is 7 times the difference between `m` and the minimum count of occurrences of each character ('A' to 'G') in the string `a`, if any character count is less than `m`. If all character counts are greater than or equal to `m`, then `needed_problems` is 0.
