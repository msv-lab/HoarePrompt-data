Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 50), `m` (an integer between 1 and 5), and `a` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). It returns `needed_problems`, which is calculated as 7 times the difference between `m` and the minimum count of problems solved in any of the 7 iterations, if any count[i] is less than `m`. If all counts are greater than or equal to `m`, then `needed_problems` is 0.**
