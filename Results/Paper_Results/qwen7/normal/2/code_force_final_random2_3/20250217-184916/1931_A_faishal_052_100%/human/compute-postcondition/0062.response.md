Output State: **`lex` is an integer less than 28, `arr` is a list containing 1.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `arr`. Since `lex` is an integer less than 28 and no other changes were made to `lex`, its value remains unchanged. The list `arr` now contains the element 1.
