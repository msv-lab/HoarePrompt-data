Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `cases`.

2. **Determine Initial Values**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `cases` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\).

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < cases`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `cases` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, `i` will take on every integer value from 0 to `cases-1`.
   - `cases` remains unchanged throughout the loop.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the initial state of `i` is set to 0 and `cases` is set to a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\).

**State:**
- `i` is **0**
- `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\)

So, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\)**
