Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program correctly identifies the possible values for the first two letters of the word by checking the range of `lex` and subtracting 2, 26, or 52 accordingly.
3. The third letter is directly taken as the remaining value of `lex`.
4. The list `arr` is sorted, but since the first two letters are fixed by the conditions and the third letter is just the remaining value, sorting does not affect the outcome.
5. The program constructs the lexicographically smallest word by converting the indices back to characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`.
6. The program prints the constructed words for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the program logic aligns with the requirements. The program correctly identifies the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
