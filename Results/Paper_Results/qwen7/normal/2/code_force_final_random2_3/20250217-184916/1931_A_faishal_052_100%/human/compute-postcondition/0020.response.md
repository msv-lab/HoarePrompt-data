Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is [26], `lex` is an input integer with the current value being less than or equal to 52, and `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 26. Since `lex` was initially less than or equal to 78, after subtracting 26, `lex` will now be less than or equal to 52. All other variables remain unchanged.
