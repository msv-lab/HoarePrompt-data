Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26], `lex` is reduced by 26, `j` is 0.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` remains 0, `cases` remains within the range of 1 to 100, `arr` can be one of the specified arrays, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `j` remains 0. The specific changes to `lex` depend on the condition of the if statement, but in both cases, `lex` is ultimately reduced by 26.
