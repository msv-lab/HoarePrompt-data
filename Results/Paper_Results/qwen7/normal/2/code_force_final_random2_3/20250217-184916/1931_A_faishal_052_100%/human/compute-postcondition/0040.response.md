Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the range `range(2)`. This means the loop will iterate over `j` from 0 to 1.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\)
   - `arr` is either [1, 1] or [1, 26] or [26], depending on the value of `lex`
   - `lex` is reduced by 1 or 26
   - `j` is 1 (since it was the end of the previous iteration)

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 2. Since `j` is currently 1, the loop will execute again when `j` is set to 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the state to reflect the start of the next iteration where `j` is 0. The other variables (`i`, `cases`, `arr`, and `lex`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is either [1, 1] or [1, 26] or [26], `lex` is reduced by 1 or 26, `j` is 0**
