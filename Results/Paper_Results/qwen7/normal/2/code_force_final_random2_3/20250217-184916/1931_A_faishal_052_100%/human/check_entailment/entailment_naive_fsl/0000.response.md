Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the characters in the word is flawed. Let's consider the test case `n = 24`:

- According to the problem, the word "aav" should be the lexicographically smallest word that encodes to 24.
- However, the program attempts to break down the integer into parts that do not necessarily correspond to valid characters in the alphabet.

For instance, when `lex = 24`, the program tries to fit the values into the ranges defined by the conditions, which do not correctly map to the characters 'a', 'a', and 'v'. The program sorts the resulting array and converts the smallest values to characters, which may not produce the correct lexicographically smallest word.

To illustrate, let's walk through the logic for `n = 24`:
- The program checks if `lex < 28`, which fails.
- It then checks if `lex < 52`, which also fails.
- Finally, it sets `arr.append(lex)` and sorts the array, resulting in `[24]`.
- Converting `[24]` to characters gives `'x'`, which is clearly incorrect.

A correct approach would involve directly calculating the characters based on the sum, ensuring that each character is within the valid range of 1 to 26. The provided solution does not achieve this, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
