Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `0` to `2`, meaning it will execute three times.

2. **Understand the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that inside the loop, `temp` is updated to be the original value of `temp` plus the character corresponding to `info[i][j]` shifted by 96. This means `temp` is being modified in each iteration based on the value of `info[i][j]`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `temp` is the original value of `temp` plus the character corresponding to `info[i][j]` shifted by 96. Since the loop just completed its previous iteration (let's say the second iteration), `j` was 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be incremented to 3. Therefore, we need to update the state to reflect this new value of `j`.

5. **State adjustment**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `j`. The value of `j` will be 3 for the next iteration.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`temp` is the original value of `temp` plus the character corresponding to `info[i][2]` shifted by 96, `j` is 3**
