Output State: **`temp` is the original value of `temp` plus the character corresponding to `info[i][2]` shifted by 96 plus the character corresponding to `info[i][3]` shifted by 96, `j` is 4**.

Explanation: The code updates `temp` by adding the character corresponding to `info[i][3]` shifted by 96 to its current value. Since `j` was initially 3, after executing the line `temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)`, `j` is incremented to 4. The value of `temp` now includes the contribution from both `info[i][2]` and `info[i][3]`.
