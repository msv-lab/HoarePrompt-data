Output State: **`temp` is the original value of `temp` plus the sum of characters corresponding to `info[i][j]` shifted by 96 for all `j` from 0 to 2*5-1 (since the loop runs 5 times), `j` is 5.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `temp` will contain a string formed by concatenating the characters obtained by shifting each element in the sublist `info[i]` by 96, for all sublists from `info[i][0]` to `info[i][2*5-1]`. The value of `j` will be 5, indicating the last iteration of the loop.
