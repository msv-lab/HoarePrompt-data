Postcondition: `lex` is an integer, `arr` contains 26, and `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is decremented by 1 and `arr` contains 1 and 26. If `lex` is 28 or greater, `arr` contains 26 and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` contains 1 and 26. Otherwise, `arr` contains 26.
