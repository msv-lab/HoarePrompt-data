Output State: **`temp` is 'abcde', `i` is 4, `j` is between 0 and 2 inclusive**

Explanation: The code snippet `temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)` appends a character to `temp`. Here, `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` generates a character based on the ASCII value. Since `j` must be between 0 and 2 inclusive, let's assume `info[i][j]` is 1, 2, or 3 (as these would correspond to 'a', 'b', and 'c' respectively when added to 96). Given that `i` is 4, the loop or context around this line would iterate 5 times (cases must be 5), appending 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e' to `temp`. Therefore, `temp` becomes 'abcde'. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged except for the constraint that `j` is between 0 and 2 inclusive.
