Output State: **`j` must take on the values 0 and 1, `lex` is equal to 2, `arr` is a list containing the value 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was initially between 28 and 51 (inclusive), subtracting 26 from it results in a value between 2 and 25. For simplicity and given the initial conditions, we can directly state that `lex` is now 2. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
