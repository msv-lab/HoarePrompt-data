Output State: **`lex` is an integer with a value greater than or equal to 26 and less than or equal to 52; `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` initially was between 52 and 78 (inclusive), subtracting 26 from it results in a new value for `lex` that is between 26 and 52 (inclusive). The value of `arr` remains unchanged.
