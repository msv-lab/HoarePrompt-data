Output State: The loop runs 3 times based on the given conditions. After all iterations, `i` remains 0, `cases` remains an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), and `lex` is reduced by a total of 3 (if it was less than 28), 52 (if it was between 28 and 52), or 53 (if it was between 52 and 78). The list `arr` will contain either three 1's, one 1 and two 26's, two 26's and one 1, or three 26's, depending on the initial value of `lex`. `j` will be 1 after the loop completes.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` stays at 0, `cases` remains unchanged, `lex` is reduced by a total of 1, 26, or 53, and `arr` will be a list of three numbers where each number is either 1 or 26 based on the initial value of `lex`.
