Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will range from 0 to `cases-1`, meaning it will take on every integer value within that range exactly once. `cases` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\). The variable `arr` will contain a list of integers where each list represents the processed values of `lex` for a particular test case, with `lex` being reduced by either 2, 26, or 52 based on the conditions specified in the loop. Each `arr` list will be sorted. The variable `lex` will hold the final value after processing for each test case, which is appended to `arr`. The `info` list will contain all the `arr` lists generated for each test case, sorted as per the loop's operation.

In summary, `info` will be a list of lists, where each inner list represents the processed values of `lex` for a specific test case, sorted according to the operations performed in the loop.
