Output State: **`j` is 2; `lex` is either `lex - 2`, `lex - 26`, or `lex - 52` depending on the initial value of `lex`; `arr` contains the element `lex` sorted.**

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Since `arr` was initially updated to contain the element `lex`, after sorting, `arr` will contain `lex` in its appropriate position based on its value. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
