Output State: **`temp` is the original value of `temp` plus the character corresponding to `info[i][2]` shifted by 96 plus the character corresponding to `info[i][3]` shifted by 96 plus the character corresponding to `info[i][4]` shifted by 96, `j` is 5**.

Explanation: The code updates `temp` by adding the character corresponding to `info[i][j]` (where `j` is 4) shifted by 96. After executing the code, `j` is incremented by 1, making it 5. The original value of `temp` includes contributions from `info[i][2]`, `info[i][3]`, and now also includes the contribution from `info[i][4]`.
