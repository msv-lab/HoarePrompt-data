Output State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing 1 or 26, `j` is 1, and `arr` now contains 1 and 26.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Depending on the value of `lex`, `arr` initially contains either `1` or `26`. After appending `26`, `arr` will contain both `1` and `26`. The value of `lex` and `j` remain unchanged.
