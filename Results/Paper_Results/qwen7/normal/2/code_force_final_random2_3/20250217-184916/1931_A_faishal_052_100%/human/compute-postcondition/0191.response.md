Output State: `temp` is 'aamo', `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 3.

After analyzing the given loop and its initial and intermediate states, we can see that the loop runs exactly 3 times based on the provided information. The variable `i` increments to 5 after the first iteration and remains there for subsequent iterations since it is not modified within the loop. The variable `j` starts from 0 and increments with each iteration until it reaches 3. The variable `temp` concatenates characters derived from `info[i][j] + 96`, which results in the string 'aamo' after 3 iterations. Since the loop runs exactly 3 times as specified by the `cases` variable, there are no further iterations to consider. Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is `temp` being 'aamo', `i` remaining 4, `j` at 3, and `cases` still needing to be greater than or equal to 3.
