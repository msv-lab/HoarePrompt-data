Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26` depending on the initial value of `lex`, if `lex` was less than 27, `arr` contains the elements [1, 1] or [1, 26], if `lex` was between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` contains the elements [26, 1] or [26], if `lex` was 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged and contains the element 1; `arr` now contains the additional element 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value 1 to the list `arr`. Since `arr` could have different initial states based on the value of `lex`, appending 1 to `arr` will add the value 1 to the existing list. The value of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
