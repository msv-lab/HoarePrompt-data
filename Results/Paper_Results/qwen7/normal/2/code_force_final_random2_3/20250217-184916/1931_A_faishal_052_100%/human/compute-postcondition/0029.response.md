Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is [1, 1], `lex` is an input integer with the current value being less than or equal to 52, and `j` is 1; `lex` is decreased by 1.**

The code decrements the value of `lex` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
