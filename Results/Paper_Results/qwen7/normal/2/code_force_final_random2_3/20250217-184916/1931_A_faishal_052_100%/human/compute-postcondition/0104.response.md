Output State: **`lex` is an integer, `arr` contains 26 and 26, `j` is 2, and `i` is 100.**

Explanation: The loop runs twice as specified by the `range(2)` in the loop header. After each iteration, `j` increments by 1, so after two iterations, `j` will be 2. The value of `i` was initially set to 1 and is not modified within the loop, so it remains 100 after the loop completes. The list `arr` appends 26 in each iteration, resulting in `arr` containing `[26, 26]`. The variable `lex` is adjusted based on the conditions inside the loop, but since the loop runs exactly twice, the final value of `lex` depends on the initial value and the conditions met during the iterations, which results in `lex` being an integer with no specific value given the conditions provided.
