Output State: **`lex` is an integer, `arr` contains 26 and 26, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the value 26 and `j` is 2. After executing the code, `arr` now contains 26 twice, while `lex` remains an integer and `j` stays unchanged.
