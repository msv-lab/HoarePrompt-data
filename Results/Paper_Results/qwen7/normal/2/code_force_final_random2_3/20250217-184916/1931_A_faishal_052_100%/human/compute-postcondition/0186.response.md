Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for j in range(3)` statement. This means the variables `j` and the implicit variable `cases` (since the loop condition depends on `cases`) are the ones that need to be considered.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
   - `temp` is 'a'
   - `i` is 5
   - `j` is 1
   - `cases` must be greater than or equal to 3

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(3)` will continue as long as `j < 3`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from its current value of 1 to 2. The condition `j < 3` must still hold true.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `temp` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `cases` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`temp` is 'a', `i` is 5, `j` is 2, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 3**
