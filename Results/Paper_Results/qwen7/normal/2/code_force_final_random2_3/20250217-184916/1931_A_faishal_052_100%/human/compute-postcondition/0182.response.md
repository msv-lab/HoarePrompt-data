Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `temp` is 'abcdefe'
   - `i` is 7
   - `j` is 5

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `cases` iterations, where `cases` is specified in the loop header `for i in range(cases)`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that `i` remains unchanged at 4 throughout the loop, and `j` starts from 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 5.

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for 3 iterations as specified by the range(3).
   - After each iteration, `temp` is updated by appending a character based on the value of `info[i][j] + 96`.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged at 4 throughout the loop.
   - `j` starts from 0 and reaches 5 after 3 iterations.

5. **Final State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `temp` is 'abcdefe'
   - `i` is 7
   - `j` is 5

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be reset to 0 (the starting point of the loop), and `i` must remain unchanged at 4.
   - Since the loop condition is met exactly 3 times, `cases` must be 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` remains 4.
- `j` resets to 0.
- `cases` must be 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`temp` is 'abcdefe', `i` is 4, `j` is 0, `cases` is 3**
