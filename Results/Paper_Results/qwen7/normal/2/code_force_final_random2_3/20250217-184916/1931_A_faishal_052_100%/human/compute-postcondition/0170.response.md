Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `temp` is the original value of `temp` plus the sum of characters corresponding to `info[i][j]` shifted by 96 for all `j` from 0 to 2*5-1 (which is 9). Here, `j` is fixed at 5 during the loop execution.
   
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs 5 times (from `j = 0` to `j = 9`).
   - For each iteration, `temp` is updated by adding the character value of `info[i][j]` shifted by 96.
   - Since `j` is fixed at 5, only `info[i][5]` will be used in each iteration.

3. **Character Value Shift**:
   - Shifting a character by 96 means subtracting 96 from its ASCII value.
   - For example, if `info[i][5]` is 'a', its ASCII value is 97, and shifting it by 96 gives 1.

4. **Final Value of `temp`**:
   - Since `j` is always 5, the value added to `temp` in each iteration is the character value of `info[i][5]` shifted by 96.
   - This process is repeated 5 times, so `temp` will be the original value of `temp` plus 5 times the shifted value of `info[i][5]`.

Given this, let's denote the character at `info[i][5]` as `c`. The final value of `temp` will be:

\[ \text{temp} = \text{original\_value\_of\_temp} + 5 \times (\text{ASCII}(c) - 96) \]

Since the exact character `c` is not specified, we can represent the final value of `temp` in terms of `c`.

Output: **original_value_of_temp + 5 * (ASCII(c) - 96)**
