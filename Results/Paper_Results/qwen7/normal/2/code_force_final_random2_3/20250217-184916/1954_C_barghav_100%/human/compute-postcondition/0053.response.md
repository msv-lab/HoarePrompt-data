The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `len(a)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `len(a)` is known.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition for the loop to continue (`i < len(a)`) must still hold true. Therefore, `len(a)` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1, `len(a)` is known**
