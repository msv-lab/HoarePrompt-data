Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: `i` is 0, `len(b)` is 3.
   - This means that `i` is set to 0.
   - The length of the list `b` is 3, so `b` must contain exactly 3 elements.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   print(b[i], end='')
   ```

3. Since `i` is 0, the expression `b[i]` refers to the first element of the list `b`.

4. The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function means that there will be no newline after the printed value, but this does not affect what is printed.

Therefore, the code will print the first element of the list `b`.

Output: **b[0]**
