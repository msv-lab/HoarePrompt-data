Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping their digits. The logic in `func_1()` only checks if the current digit of `a` (from `x`) is less than the corresponding digit of `b` (from `y`). If so, it swaps them, but this approach does not guarantee that the product will be maximized. For example:

Consider the test case:
```
2
98
12
```

The program's output would be:
```
98
12
```

However, the optimal solution should be:
```
92
81
```

This is because swapping the digits '9' and '1' and '8' and '2' results in a higher product (92 * 81 = 7452) compared to the original product (98 * 12 = 1176).

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
