Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is 2.
2. `len(a)` is known, but the actual length of the list `a` is not specified. This means `a` could be any list with a length greater than or equal to 2.
3. The print statement accesses `a[i]`, where `i` is 2. Therefore, it will try to print the third element of the list `a` (since list indexing starts at 0).

Given these points, we can conclude that the print statement will attempt to print the third element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[2]**
