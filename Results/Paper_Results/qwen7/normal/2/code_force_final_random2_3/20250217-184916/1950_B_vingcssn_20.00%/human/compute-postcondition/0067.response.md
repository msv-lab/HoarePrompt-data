Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `c` in the range `range(0, casos)`. This means the loop variable `c` ranges from 0 to `casos - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `c`**: At the start of the loop, `c` is 0 because the range starts from 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `c` is less than `casos`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 0 (since the loop just started).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: Since `c` is now 1 and the loop condition is `c < casos`, the loop will continue as long as `c` is less than `casos`.

6. **Update the required states**:
   - `casos` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `c` is updated to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`casos` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\), `n` is an input integer, `c` is 1**.
