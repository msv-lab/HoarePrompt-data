Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Identify the variables involved in the loop head:
   - The loop variable `c` (which is initialized to 0 and incremented in each iteration).
   - The loop control variable `casos`.

2. Determine the conditions under which the loop can execute:
   - The loop will execute as long as `c` is less than `casos`.
   - Initially, `c` is set to 0, so the loop will start executing if `casos` is greater than 0.

3. Adjust the states of the relevant variables:
   - Since `c` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `casos` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `casos` is greater than 0.

4. Consider the initial state given:
   - `casos` is an input integer.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `casos` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The value of `t` is not directly relevant to the loop condition but might be used within the loop body.

State: **`casos` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20**
