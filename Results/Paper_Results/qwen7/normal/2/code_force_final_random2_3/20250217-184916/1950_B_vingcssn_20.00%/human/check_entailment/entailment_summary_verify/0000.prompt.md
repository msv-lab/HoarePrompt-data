You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Program:
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a number of test cases and for each case, it reads an integer \(n\) and prints a specific pattern based on the value of \(n\). If \(n\) is 1, it prints two lines of "##". If \(n\) is 2, it prints four lines with alternating patterns. If \(n\) is 3, it prints six lines with a more complex pattern. If \(n\) is 4, it prints eight lines with an even more complex pattern. If \(n\) is outside the range 1 to 4, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final value of `c`, which is `casos - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not generate a 2n × 2n checkerboard for arbitrary values of n within the specified range. It only handles specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and outputs hardcoded patterns. For any other value of n, the program prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range"), which is incorrect according to the problem description. The program should generate a checkerboard pattern for any valid n, not just specific cases.
