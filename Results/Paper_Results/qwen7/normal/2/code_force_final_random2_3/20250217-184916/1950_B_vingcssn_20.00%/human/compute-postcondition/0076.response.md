The initial state provides the following information:
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is an integer input by the user.
- `c` is 1.

The `print` statement in question is:
```python
print('##..##')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'##..##'` without referencing any of the variables `casos`, `t`, `n`, or `c`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **##..##**
