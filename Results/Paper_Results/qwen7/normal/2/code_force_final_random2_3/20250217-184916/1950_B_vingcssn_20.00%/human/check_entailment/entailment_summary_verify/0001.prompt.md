You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Program:
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a number of test cases and for each case, it reads an integer \(n\) and prints a specific pattern based on the value of \(n\). If \(n\) is 1, it prints two lines of "##". If \(n\) is 2, it prints four lines with alternating patterns. If \(n\) is 3, it prints six lines with a more complex pattern. If \(n\) is 4, it prints eight lines with an even more complex pattern. If \(n\) is outside the range 1 to 4, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final value of `c`, which is `casos - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`casos`) and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Checkerboard Generation for Specific Values:**
   - For `n = 1`, the program prints a 2x2 checkerboard correctly.
   - For `n = 2`, the program prints a 4x4 checkerboard correctly.
   - For `n = 3`, the program prints a 6x6 checkerboard correctly.
   - For `n = 4`, the program prints an 8x8 checkerboard correctly.
   
3. **Handling Larger Values:**
   - The program includes an `else` block that prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range") when `n` is greater than 4. However, according to the problem statement, the input should always be within the range `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`. Therefore, this `else` block is unnecessary and incorrect because it does not handle any invalid input as per the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the specific values of `n` up to 4, but it fails to address the general case where `n > 4`. Since the problem specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`, the program should either handle all values within this range or explicitly state that it only handles values up to 4. Given that the problem does not specify handling invalid inputs, the program should be corrected to handle all values within the specified range.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case where `n > 4`.

**Correctness: **False**
