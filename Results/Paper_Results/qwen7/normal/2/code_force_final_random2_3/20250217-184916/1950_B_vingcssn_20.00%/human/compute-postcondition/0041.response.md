Output State: **`casos` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\), `n` is an input integer. If `n` equals 1, it remains 1. If `n` equals 2, it remains 2. If `n` equals 3, it becomes 3. Otherwise, `n` remains different from 1, 2, and 4, and `c` is 0, `n` is an integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The conditions for `n` (whether it is 1, 2, or 3) are preserved, and if none of these conditions are met, `n` remains unchanged and `c` is set to 0. The values of `casos` and `t` remain unaffected.
