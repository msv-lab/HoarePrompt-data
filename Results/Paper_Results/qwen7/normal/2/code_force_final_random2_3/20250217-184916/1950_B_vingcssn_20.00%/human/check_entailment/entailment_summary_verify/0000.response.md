### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program only handles specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and outputs hardcoded patterns. However, the problem description specifies that the program should generate a checkerboard pattern for any valid \( n \) within the range 1 to 20, not just the specific cases handled in the current implementation.

Given the problem description and the function summary, we can see that the program should be able to generate a 2n × 2n checkerboard for any \( n \) in the range 1 to 20. The function summary indicates that the program should handle these cases but does not specify how it should do so. 

Since the problem requires generating a checkerboard pattern for any valid \( n \), the current implementation is incomplete and incorrect. The program should use a general algorithm to generate the checkerboard pattern instead of hardcoding the patterns for specific values of \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not generate a 2n × 2n checkerboard for arbitrary values of \( n \) within the specified range. It only handles specific cases and outputs "No esta en el rango" for other values, which is not in accordance with the problem description.
