Output State: `casos` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\), `n` is an integer input by the user for each iteration of the loop, `c` is equal to `casos - 1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `casos` will have been decremented by the number of times the loop ran, leaving `c` with a value of `casos - 1`. The value of `n` will depend on the input provided during each iteration of the loop. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and not modified within the loop.
