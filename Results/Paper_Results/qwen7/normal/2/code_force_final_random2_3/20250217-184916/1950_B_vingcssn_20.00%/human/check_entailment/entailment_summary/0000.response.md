Reasoning:
- The provided program only handles the cases for \(n = 1, 2, 3,\) and \(4\).
- For any other value of \(n\), the program incorrectly prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the expected checkerboard pattern.
- According to the problem statement, the program should generate a \(2n \times 2n\) checkerboard for any \(n\) within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).

Given that the program does not correctly handle values of \(n\) outside the range 1 to 4, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
