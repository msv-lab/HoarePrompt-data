Output State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 0; `iterable2` is 1; `x` is an input integer; `a` is an input integer; `big` contains the value of `a`**

Explanation: The line `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is an input integer, it gets added to the list `big`. The other variables (`innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
