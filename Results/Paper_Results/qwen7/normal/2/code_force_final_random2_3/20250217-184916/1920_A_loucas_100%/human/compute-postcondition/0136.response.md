Output State: **`no` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing `a`, `less` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, the current value of `x` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, it remains as is in the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
