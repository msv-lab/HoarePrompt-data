Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t and an integer n. For each test case, it reads n lines of input, where each line contains two integers a and x. Based on the value of x, it categorizes a into three lists: `big`, `less`, and `no`. After processing all inputs, it calculates the difference between the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`, adjusting this difference by subtracting one for each element in `no` that falls within the range defined by `min(less)` and `max(big)`. If the resulting value is less than 1, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints the adjusted difference.**
