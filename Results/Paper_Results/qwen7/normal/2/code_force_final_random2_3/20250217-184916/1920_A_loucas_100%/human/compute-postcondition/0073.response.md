Output State: **`num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing the value `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` (which is an input integer) to the list `big`. Since `big` was not defined before, it is initialized as a list containing the value `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
