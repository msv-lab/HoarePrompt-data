Output State: **`no` contains a value that is at least one integer less than its original value, the current minimum value in the `less` list is greater than or equal to `i`, and the current maximum value in the `big` list is less than or equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is decremented by 1. Since `no` must contain at least one integer, and the conditions regarding the `less` and `big` lists relative to `i` remain unchanged, these conditions still hold true after the decrement operation.
