Postcondition: `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer. If `x` is 1, `a` is added to a list named `big`. If `x` is 2, `a` is checked to be in a list named `less`. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `a` is appended to a list named `no`.
