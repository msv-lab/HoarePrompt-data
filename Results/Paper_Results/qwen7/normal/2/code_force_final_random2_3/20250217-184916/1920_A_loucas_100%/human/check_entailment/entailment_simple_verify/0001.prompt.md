You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: All elements from `no` have been iterated over, and for each iteration, the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)` was satisfied, leading to `num` being decremented by 1 for each such element. Therefore, `num` is now equal to zero since all elements in `no` that met the condition have been processed. The variables `innerLoop` is now 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1` (which is -1), `big` contains all integers `a` for which `x` was 1 during the iterations, `less` contains all integers `a` for which `x` was 2 during the iterations, and `no` is empty as all its elements have been processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `loop`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `innerLoop`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Lists `less`, `big`, and `no` are initialized to store the values from the constraints.
   - Variable `num` is initialized to 0. This variable will hold the count of valid `k` values.

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program checks the type (`x`) and appends the value `a` to the appropriate list:
     - If `x == 1`, append to `big` (values that `k` must be greater than or equal to).
     - If `x == 2`, append to `less` (values that `k` must be less than or equal to).
     - If `x == 3`, append to `no` (values that `k` must not be equal to).

4. **Calculating Initial Range:**
   - The initial range of possible values for `k` is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. This gives the number of integers between the smallest allowed value and the largest allowed value.

5. **Adjusting for "Not Equal" Constraints:**
   - For each value in the `no` list, check if it falls within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`. If it does, decrement `num` by 1 because this value cannot be used for `k`.

6. **Output:**
   - Print the final count of valid `k` values.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

#### Example 1:
- Test case with 4 constraints:
  - Constraints: \( k \geq 3 \), \( k \leq 10 \), \( k \neq 1 \), \( k \neq 5 \)
  - Possible values for `k`: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
  - Output: 7

#### Example 2:
- Test case with 2 constraints:
  - Constraints: \( k \geq 5 \), \( k \leq 4 \)
  - No possible values for `k`
  - Output: 0

#### Example 3:
- Test case with 10 constraints:
  - Constraints: \( k \neq 6 \), \( k \neq 7 \), \( k \geq 2 \), \( k \leq 100 \), \( k \neq 100 \), \( k \neq 44 \), \( k \leq 100 \), \( k \geq 98 \), \( k \neq 3 \), \( k \neq 99 \)
  - Possible values for `k`: 2 to 97 (excluding 3, 6, 7, 44, 98, 99, 100)
  - Output: 90

### Conclusion

The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the valid range of `k` values. It handles the "not equal" constraints appropriately by subtracting them from the initial range.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
