Output State: **`i` is the next element in `no`, `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` - 1, `i` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is decremented by 1 (`num -= 1`). Since `i` was originally less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, after decrementing `i` by 1, `i` will now be less than or equal to the new minimum value in `less` (which is 1 less than the original minimum) and still greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`. The state of `no` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
