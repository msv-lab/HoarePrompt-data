Output State: **`i` is the next element in `no` and `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` - 1, `i` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big` - 1.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is decremented by 1 (`num -= 1`). Since `i` was initially less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, after decrementing `i` by 1, `i` is now less than or equal to the new minimum value in `less` (which is the original minimum value minus 1) and greater than or equal to the new maximum value in `big` (which is the original maximum value minus 1).
