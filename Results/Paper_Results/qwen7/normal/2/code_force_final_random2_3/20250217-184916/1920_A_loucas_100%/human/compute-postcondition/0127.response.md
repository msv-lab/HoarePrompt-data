Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `no` contains no integers.
   - `big` and `less` lists remain unchanged.
   - `num` is decremented by the number of times an element in `no` satisfied the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the `no` list.
   - Each iteration checks if the current element `i` satisfies the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, `num` is decremented by 1.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `no` is empty (since all elements that satisfy the condition are removed).
   - `big` and `less` lists remain unchanged.
   - `num` is decremented by the count of elements in `no` that satisfied the condition.

4. **For Loop**:
   - The loop runs for `loop` iterations.
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `iterable` and `loop`.
   - Since `no` is empty, the loop will not execute again because the condition `no` having elements is not met.
   - Therefore, `num` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Final State**:
   - `no` is still empty.
   - `big` and `less` lists remain unchanged.
   - `num` remains unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`no` contains no integers, `big` and `less` lists remain unchanged, and `num` remains unchanged**.
