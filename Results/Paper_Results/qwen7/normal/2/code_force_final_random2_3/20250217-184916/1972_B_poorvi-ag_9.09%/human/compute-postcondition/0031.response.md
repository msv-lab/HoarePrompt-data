Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and possibly 'no', `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user.**

The code `arr = input()` assigns the value of the string input by the user to the variable `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
