Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'no', `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, and the current value of `n` is even**.

The code `results.append('no')` adds the string `'no'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
