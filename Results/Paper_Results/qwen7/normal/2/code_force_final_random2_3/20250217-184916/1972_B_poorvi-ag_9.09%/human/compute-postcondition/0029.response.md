Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `results` is a list containing 'yes' and possibly 'no'.
   - `i` is equal to `t`.
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `arr` is the new input string.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `t`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i = t + 1`.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change within the loop itself.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be `t + 1`.
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `results`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and possibly 'no', `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is the new input string.**
