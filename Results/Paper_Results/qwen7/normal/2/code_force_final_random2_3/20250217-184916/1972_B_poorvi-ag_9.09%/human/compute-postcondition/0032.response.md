Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and 'no', `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, and 'no' is appended to the `results` list.**

The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
