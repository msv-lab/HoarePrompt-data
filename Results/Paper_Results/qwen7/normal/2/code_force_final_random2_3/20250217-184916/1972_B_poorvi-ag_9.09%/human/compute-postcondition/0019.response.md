Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(t)`. This means the loop will run `t` times.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no'.
   - `i` is 0 (indicating the first iteration).
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `arr` is the string input by the user.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `t-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `t`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `t`.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of iterations the loop should perform.

6. **Other Variables**:
   - `results`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and their values are determined outside the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer, and `arr` is the string input by the user.**
