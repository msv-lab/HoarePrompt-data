Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'yes', `i` is 0, `n` is an odd integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, and the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`.**

The code `results.append('yes')` adds the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
