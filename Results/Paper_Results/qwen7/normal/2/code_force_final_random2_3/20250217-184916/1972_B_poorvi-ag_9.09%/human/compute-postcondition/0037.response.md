Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and 'no', `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, and either 'no' or 'yes' is appended to the `results` list. Specifically, 'no' is appended if `n` is even, and 'yes' is appended if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D'.
