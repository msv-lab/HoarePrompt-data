Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and possibly 'no', `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the new input string, `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`**.

This means that the value of `t` remains unchanged, `results` remains a list containing 'yes' and possibly 'no', `i` is still `t + 1`, `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user (after converting the input to an integer), and `arr` remains the new input string.
