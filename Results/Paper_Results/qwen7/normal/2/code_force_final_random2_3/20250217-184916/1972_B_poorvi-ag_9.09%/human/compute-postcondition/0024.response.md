Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and 'no', `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is the new input string**.

Explanation: The code `results.append('no')` adds the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contained either `'yes'` or `'no'`, but now it contains both `'yes'` and `'no'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
