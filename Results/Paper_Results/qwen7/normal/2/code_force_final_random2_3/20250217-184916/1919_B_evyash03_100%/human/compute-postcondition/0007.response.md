Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string consisting of characters `+` and `-`, `char` is the next character in the string, `count` is 2**

Explanation: The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Initially, `count` is 1, so after executing this line, `count` becomes 2. The values of `expression` and `char` remain unchanged.
