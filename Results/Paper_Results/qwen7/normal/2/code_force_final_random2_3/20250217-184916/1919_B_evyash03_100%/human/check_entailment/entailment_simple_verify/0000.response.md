### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string (`length`) and the string itself (`expression`).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes the string `expression` and its length `length` as arguments.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through each character in `expression` and increments `count` for every `'+'` character found.
   - After the loop, `count` will hold the number of `'+'` characters in `expression`.
   - It calculates `sub` as `length - count`, which represents the number of `'-'` characters.
   - Finally, it returns `abs(sub - count)`, which is the absolute difference between the number of `'-'` characters and the number of `'+'` characters.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The returned value from `func_1` is the absolute difference between the number of `'-'` characters and the number of `'+'` characters.
   - This approach does not consider any optimal splitting of the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply counts the number of positive and negative elements and calculates a penalty based on their difference.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     10
     --+++++++-
     ```
     - The function will count 1 `'+'` and 9 `'-'` characters.
     - It will then compute `abs(9 - 1) = 8`.
     - However, the correct minimum penalty would be 0, achieved by splitting the array into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`.

5. **Dynamic Programming or Greedy Strategy:**
   - The problem requires finding the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
   - A simple counting approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty because it does not consider the optimal splitting of the array.
   - The provided function does not implement any dynamic programming or greedy strategy to find the optimal splits.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

**Final: False**
