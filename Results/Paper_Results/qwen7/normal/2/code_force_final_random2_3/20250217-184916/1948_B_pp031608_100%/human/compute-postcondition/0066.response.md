Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is updated to include the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digits of `arr[i]`, and `ans` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block shown, the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional block we are currently inside. The values of the variables `m`, `i`, `arr[i - 1]`, `nums`, and `ans` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables.
