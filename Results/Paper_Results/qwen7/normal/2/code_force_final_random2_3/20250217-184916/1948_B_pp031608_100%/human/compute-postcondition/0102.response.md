Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is equal to the last digit of `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digit of `arr[i]`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code converts `arr[i - 1]` to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts it to an integer, and appends it to the list `nums`. Then it appends the digit of `arr[i]` to the list `nums`.
- Since `arr[i]` is the last element of `nums`, `arr[i]` is now the last digit of `arr[i - 1]` appended to itself.
