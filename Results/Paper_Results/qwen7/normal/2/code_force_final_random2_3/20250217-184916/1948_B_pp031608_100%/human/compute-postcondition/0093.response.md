Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the new value of `arr[i]`, and `ans` remains unchanged if `nums` was already sorted. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `False`.**

Explanation:
- `nums` is updated to be a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the new value of `arr[i]`.
- The initial state of `m` and `i` remain unchanged.
- `arr[i]` is the first element of the updated `nums`.
- The value of `ans` depends on whether `nums` was already sorted before the update. If `nums` was sorted, `ans` remains unchanged. If `nums` was not sorted, `ans` is set to `False`.
