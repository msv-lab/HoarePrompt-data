Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is assigned the value of the integer input. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^3 is preserved, while `n` is set to the value of the input integer which must be between 2 and 50.
