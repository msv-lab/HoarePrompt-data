Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is updated to include the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digits of `arr[i]`, and `ans` is False.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` sets the variable `ans` to `False`. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
