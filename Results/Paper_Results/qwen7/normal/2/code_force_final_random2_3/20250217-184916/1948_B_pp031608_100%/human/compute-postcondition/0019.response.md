Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is `m-2`, `arr[i - 1]` is `arr[m-3]`, `arr[i]` is the last digit of `arr[m-3]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the last digit of `arr[m-3]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, and `ans` is `False`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. None of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `arr`, `nums`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their previous values remain unchanged.
