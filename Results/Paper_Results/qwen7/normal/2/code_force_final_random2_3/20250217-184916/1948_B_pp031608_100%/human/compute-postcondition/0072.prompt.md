Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `m` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `ans` is True
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is either equal to `arr[i - 1]` (if `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`), or `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]` and `nums` is a list containing the digits of the new `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If the current state of `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False. If `nums` is already sorted, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, and `nums` is updated to include the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digits of `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` is set to False. If the current state of `nums` is not sorted, `ans` remains False. If `nums` is already sorted, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, and `nums` is updated to include the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digits of `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` remains unchanged and is set to False. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` remains False. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
