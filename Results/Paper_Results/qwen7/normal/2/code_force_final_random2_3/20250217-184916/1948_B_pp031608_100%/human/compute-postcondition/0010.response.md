Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is `m-1`, `arr[i]` is the last digit of `arr[i-1]` concatenated with `arr[i]`, and `nums` is a list containing these digits, `ans` is `False`.**

The variable `ans` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other changes are made to the variables, so the conditions and values of `m`, `i`, `arr`, and `nums` remain the same as the initial state.
