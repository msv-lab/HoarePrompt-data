Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is `m-1`, `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is the last digit of `arr[i-1]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, and `nums` is a list containing these digits. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is `False`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be the first element of the list `nums`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still `m-1`, `arr[i]` is still the last digit of `arr[i-1]` concatenated with `arr[i]`, and `nums` is still a list containing these digits. The state of `ans` remains unchanged unless `nums` is no longer sorted, which is not indicated by the given code.
