Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is `m-2`, `arr[i - 1]` is `arr[m-3]`, `arr[i]` is the last digit of `arr[m-3]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the last digit of `arr[m-3]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, and `ans` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no such loop or conditional was specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that we know the execution would break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
