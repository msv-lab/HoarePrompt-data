Postcondition: `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, and `nums` is updated to include the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digits of `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` remains unchanged and is set to False. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` remains False. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
