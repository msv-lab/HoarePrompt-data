Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input through multiple lines. It first reads an integer `n` where 2 <= n <= 50, followed by `n` integers each between 0 and 99. The function then returns a result based on the processed data.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters when called but expects input in a specific format (multiple lines of integers) and returns a result after processing this input.
