Postcondition: `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the new value of `arr[i]`, and `ans` is `False`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` remains `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
