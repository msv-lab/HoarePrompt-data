Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is updated to include the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digits of `arr[i]`, `ans` is False.**

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. Since `nums` is updated to include the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digits of `arr[i]`, the value of `nums` changes accordingly. The values of `m`, `i`, `arr[i]`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
