Output State: **`t` is 0, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `prod` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `prod = 1` initializes the variable `prod` to 1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `bets`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of these variables while adding the new value of `prod`.
