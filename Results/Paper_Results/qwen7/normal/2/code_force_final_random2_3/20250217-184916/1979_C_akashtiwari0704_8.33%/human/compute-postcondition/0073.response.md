Output State: **`i` is 4; `ans` is 'a[0]a[1]a[4]'; `bets` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by appending the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is currently 3) followed by a space. Since `i` was initially 3, it gets incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4. The new value of `ans` is `'a[0]a[1]' + 'a[3]' + ' '` which simplifies to `'a[0]a[1]a[4]'`. The variable `bets` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.
