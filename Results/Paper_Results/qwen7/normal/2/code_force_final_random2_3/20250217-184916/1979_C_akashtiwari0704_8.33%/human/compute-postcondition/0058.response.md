Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i]) + int(a[i])`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates `sumo` by adding `int(a[i])` to its current value. Given that `i` is 2, `sumo += int(a[i])` means `sumo` is increased by `int(a[2])`. Since `a[i]` is also updated to `prod // a[i]`, the value of `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) is now `prod // a[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
