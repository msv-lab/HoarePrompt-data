State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, T is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `T` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
2. The loop condition is `range(t)`, which means the loop will run from 0 to `t-1`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
4. Since `T` is initialized to 0, the first iteration of the loop will occur if `t` is greater than 0.
5. The value of `t` must be within the specified range (1 to \(10^4\)).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
