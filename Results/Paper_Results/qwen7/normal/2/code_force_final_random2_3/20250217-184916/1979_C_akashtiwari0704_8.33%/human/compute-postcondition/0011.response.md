Output State: `t` is 0, `bets` must be equal to the length of the list `a`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `bets`, which is the number of times the loop ran. The variable `prod` will be the cumulative product of all elements in the list `a`, since the loop multiplies `prod` by each element in `a` for every iteration. The variable `t` remains 0 as it was not affected by the loop, and `bets` must be equal to the length of the list `a` for the loop to run the correct number of times.
