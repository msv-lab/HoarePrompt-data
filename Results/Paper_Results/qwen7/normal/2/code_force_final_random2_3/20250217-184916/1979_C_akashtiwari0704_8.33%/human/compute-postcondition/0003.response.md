Output State: **`t` is 0, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by splitting the input string (which is expected to contain space-separated integers) into individual elements and converting each element to an integer. The original values of `t` and `bets` remain unchanged.
