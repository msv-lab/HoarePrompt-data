Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list `k` containing `n` positive integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `t` and `k`.**
