Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = 1
    for i in range(bets):
        prod *= a[i]
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bets` is the final length of the list `a`, `i` is equal to `bets`, and either `sumo` is the sum of the updated values of `a[i]` (each converted to an integer) where `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, or `ans` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `a` separated by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bets` is the final value it was set to, `i` is equal to `2 * (bets - 1)`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for every index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`. Additionally, the condition `sumo >= prod` either holds true or `ans` is a string containing the concatenation of `str(a[i])` for each `i` in the range of `bets`, depending on whether the if condition `sumo >= prod` is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bets` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is 0, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` up to index `bets-1`, `sumo` is the cumulative sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, and each element `a[i]` in the list is updated to the value of `prod // a[i]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function does not change these values. Otherwise, `i` is set to `bets - 1`, `prod` remains unchanged, and `ans` is the string value of `a[0]` concatenated with the string values of all `a[i]` for `i` from `0` to `bets-1` separated by spaces.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
