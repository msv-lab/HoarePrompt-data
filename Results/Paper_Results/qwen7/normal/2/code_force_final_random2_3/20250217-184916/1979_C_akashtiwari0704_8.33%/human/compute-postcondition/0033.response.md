Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `bets`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < bets`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `bets` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ans` is a string containing the first element of `a` followed by a space.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `bets` must still be at least 1 (since the loop condition is `i < bets`).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `bets` must remain at least 1.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `bets` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`bets` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the first element of `a` followed by a space**
