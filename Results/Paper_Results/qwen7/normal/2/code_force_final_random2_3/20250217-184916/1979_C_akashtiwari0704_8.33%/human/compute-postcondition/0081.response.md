Output State: **`T` is `bets`, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `prod` is 1**

The code initializes the variable `prod` to 1. This does not affect the values of `T`, `bets`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only new information is that `prod` is now set to 1.
