Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[2]) + int(a[2]) + int(a[i])`, `a[2]` is equal to `prod // a[2]`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation:
- The initial state had `bets` greater than 3, `i` as 3, `sumo` increased by `int(a[2]) + int(a[2])`, `a[2]` equal to `prod // a[2]`, and `a[i]` equal to `prod // a[i]`.
- The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the value of `int(a[i])`.
- Since `i` is 3, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, which means `a[3]` is `prod // a[3]`.
- Therefore, `sumo` is now increased by `int(a[3])`, which is `int(prod // a[3])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
