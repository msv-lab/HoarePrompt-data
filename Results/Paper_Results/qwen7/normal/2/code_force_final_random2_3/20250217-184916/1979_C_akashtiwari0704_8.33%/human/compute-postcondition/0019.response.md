Output State: **`t` is 0, `bets` is the length of the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `sumo` is the sum of `a[i]` converted to integer plus the previous value of `sumo`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `i` by 1 and adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `bets` also remains unchanged as it is the length of the list `a` and does not change during the execution of the code. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `sumo` is updated to include the integer value of `a[i]` added to its previous value.
