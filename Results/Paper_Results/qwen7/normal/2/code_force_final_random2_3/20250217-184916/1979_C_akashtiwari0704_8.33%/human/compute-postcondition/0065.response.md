Based on the initial state provided:

- `bets` is the final value it was set to.
- `i` is equal to `bets`.
- `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for every index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.
- Each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`.
- The condition `sumo >= prod` holds true.

The print statement is `print(-1)`. This statement will simply print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
