Output State: **`T` is `bets`, `bets` must be a positive integer and greater than 1, `i` is 3, `prod` is equal to `a[0] * a[1] * a[3]`**

Explanation: The code `prod *= a[i]` multiplies the current value of `prod` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `prod` is updated to `a[0] * a[1] * a[3]`. The values of `T`, `bets`, and `i` remain unchanged.
