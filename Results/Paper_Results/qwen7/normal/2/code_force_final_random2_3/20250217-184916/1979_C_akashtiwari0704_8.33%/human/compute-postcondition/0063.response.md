Output State: `bets` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `int(a[i])` for each iteration from 0 to `bets-1`, and `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `bets`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `bets` will be the final value it was set to, `i` will be equal to `bets`, `sumo` will be the sum of `int(a[i])` for every index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and each element `a[i]` will be updated to `prod // a[i]`.
