Output State: **`line` is the next line from the input file, `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line`**.

Explanation: The code `elements = line.split()` splits the string `line` into a list of substrings based on whitespace (or other specified delimiters) and assigns this list to the variable `elements`. The variable `line` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes both variables as described.
