Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), and a list `a` containing `n` integers (each in the range 1 to n, inclusive, and appearing at most twice). It returns a result based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result specific to each test case.
