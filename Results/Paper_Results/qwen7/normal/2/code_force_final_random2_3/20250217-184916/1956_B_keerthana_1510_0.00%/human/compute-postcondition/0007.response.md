Output State: **`elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` starting from index 2 and taking every second element.**

Explanation: The code `elements = line.split()` splits the string `line` into a list of substrings based on whitespace by default. Since `line` is described as the next line in the sliced list starting from index 2 and taking every second element, the split operation will create a list of strings from `line`. The initial state of `elements` being a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` starting from index 2 and taking every second element is now explicitly stated.
