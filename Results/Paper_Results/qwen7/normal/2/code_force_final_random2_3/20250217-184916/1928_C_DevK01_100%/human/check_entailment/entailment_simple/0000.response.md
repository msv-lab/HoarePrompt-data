### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position and the number he received during the "first-k-th" settling process are consistent with the given constraints.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) need to fit within this repeating pattern.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of \( q = \frac{y-2}{2} \) that are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \).

3. **Analysis of `func_1` Function**:
   - The function calculates the divisors of \( q \) and checks if they meet the condition \( \geq x-1 \).
   - The logic correctly identifies all divisors of \( q \) that satisfy the condition, which corresponds to valid \( k \) values.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly computes \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
   - The result is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then the length of the set is printed, which gives the number of valid \( k \) values.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0.
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) are respected.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly identifies valid \( k \) values.
   - The main program correctly uses the results from `func_1` to determine the number of valid \( k \) values.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
