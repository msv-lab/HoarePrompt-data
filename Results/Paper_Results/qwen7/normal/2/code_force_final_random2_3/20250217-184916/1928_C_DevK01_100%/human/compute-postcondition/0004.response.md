Postcondition: `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q); `M` is a list. If `w` (which is the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains `[w]`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.
