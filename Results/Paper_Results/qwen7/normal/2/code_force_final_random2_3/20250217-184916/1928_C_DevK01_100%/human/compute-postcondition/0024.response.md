Postcondition: `i` is 2, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, `w` must be greater than 2, `M` is a list containing the integers 1, 2, and `q // 2`. If `q // i >= x - 1`, then `q // 2` is included in the list `M`. There is no else part in the code, so the conditions do not change regardless of the if condition's outcome.
