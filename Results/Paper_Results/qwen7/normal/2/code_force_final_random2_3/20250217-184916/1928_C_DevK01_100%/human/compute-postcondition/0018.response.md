The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 1, so after the increment, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`q`, `w`, `M`, `x`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, and `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer greater than 1; `M` is a list containing the integers 1 and `q // i`. If `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` includes `q // i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged as a list containing the integers 1 and `q // i`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, and `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer greater than 1; `M` is a list containing the integers 1 and `q // i`. If `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` includes `q // i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged as a list containing the integers 1 and `q // i`.**
