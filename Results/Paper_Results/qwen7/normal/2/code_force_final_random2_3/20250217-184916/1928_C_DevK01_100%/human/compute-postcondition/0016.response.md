Postcondition: `i` is 1, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, and `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer greater than 1; `M` is a list containing the integers 1 and `q // i`. If `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` includes `q // i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged as a list containing the integers 1 and `q // i`.
