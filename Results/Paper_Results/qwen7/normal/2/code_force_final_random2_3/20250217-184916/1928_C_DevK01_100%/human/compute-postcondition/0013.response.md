Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, and `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer greater than 1; `M` is a list containing the integers 1 and `q // i`; the value of `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [q // i]` appends the value of `q // i` to the list `M`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 1, so `q // i` is simply `q`. Since `q` is a perfect square greater than 1, appending `q` to the list `M` results in `M` containing the integers 1 and `q`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
