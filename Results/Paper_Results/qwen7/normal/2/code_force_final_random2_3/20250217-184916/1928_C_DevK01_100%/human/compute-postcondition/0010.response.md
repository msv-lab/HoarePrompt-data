Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, and `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer greater than 1; `M` is a list containing the integer 1.**

Explanation: The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `M`. The values of `q` and `w` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The precondition that `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` is not used here since `x` is not defined in the given context. Therefore, only the list `M` is updated with the value of `i`.
