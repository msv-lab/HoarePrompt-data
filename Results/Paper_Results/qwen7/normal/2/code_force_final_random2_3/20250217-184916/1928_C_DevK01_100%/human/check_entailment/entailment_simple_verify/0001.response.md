### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculating `y`:**
   - It calculates `y = n + x`.

3. **Checking Parity of `y`:**
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
   - If `y` is even, it proceeds further.

4. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - It calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and stores the result in `L1`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds the result of another call to `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to `L1`.

5. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - It converts `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and then calculates the length of the set.

6. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes `q` and `x` as arguments.
   - It initializes an empty list `M`.
   - It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It iterates from `1` to `w` and checks if `q` is divisible by `i` and if either `i` or `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It appends valid values to `M` and returns `M`.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Parity Check:**
   - The condition `if y % 2 != 0:` correctly identifies when `y` is odd, ensuring that the settling pattern cannot exist in such cases, which is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` aims to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The approach of checking both `i` and `q // i` ensures that all relevant divisors are considered.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The function `func_1` should only consider divisors of `q` that are within the range `[x-1, q]`. The current implementation includes all divisors up to `w`, which is the square root of `q`. This can lead to incorrect results because not all divisors within the range `[x-1, q]` are considered.

3. **Combining Results:**
   - The combination of results from `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` is handled correctly.
   - The use of a set to remove duplicates before calculating the length is appropriate.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `n` is very large and `x` is small, ensuring that the calculations do not overflow or produce incorrect results.

#### Corrected Function `func_1`:

To fix the issue, we need to modify the function `func_1` to only consider divisors within the range `[x-1, q]`.

```python
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    for i in range(x - 1, q + 1):
        if q % i == 0:
            M.append(i)
    return M
```

With this corrected function, the program should correctly identify the number of possible values of `k` that satisfy the given conditions.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the function `func_1` incorrectly considers all divisors up to the square root of `q` instead of only those within the range `[x-1, q]`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
