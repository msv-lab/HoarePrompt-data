You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), and x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q).
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: Postcondition: `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q); `M` is a list. If `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains `[w]`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` will be `w + 1`, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer, and `M` will contain all integers from 1 up to and including `w`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `w + 1`. During each iteration, if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` itself or `q // i` is added to the list `M`. Since the loop processes all divisors of `q` up to `w`, `M` will include all integers from 1 up to and including `w`.
    return M
    #The program returns a list `M` containing all integers from 1 up to and including the square root `w` of `q`, where `q` is a perfect square greater than 1 and `w` is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. It returns a list `M` containing all integers from 1 up to and including the square root `w` of `q`, where `q` is a perfect square greater than 1 and `w` is an integer. If the square root `w` of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `w` is included in the list `M`. The function iterates through all divisors of `q` up to `w`, adding those that meet the condition to the list `M`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` and its usage in the main loop do not accurately determine the number of valid `k` values for the given constraints.

Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid `k` Values**: The function `func_1` calculates potential values of `k` based on certain conditions, but these conditions are not correctly derived from the problem statement. The logic inside `func_1` does not properly account for the repeating pattern of settling every `2k-2` positions.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Position and Number Constraints**: The main logic in the program does not correctly handle the constraints and the repeating pattern of settling. It incorrectly uses the formula `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` without properly accounting for the periodicity and the exact placement of `x` within the repeating sequence.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:
- Input: `100 99`
- Expected Output: `0`

Given the position `x = 99`, the program should determine if there exists any `k` such that the settling pattern fits the given position and number. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate this.

A correct implementation would involve:
- Determining the period of the settling pattern (`2k-2`).
- Checking if the given position and number fit into this pattern correctly.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the valid `k` values, it fails for at least one input case, making the program incorrect.
