Output State: **`i` is 4, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, `w` must be greater than 3, and `M` is a list containing the integers 1, `q // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The conditions for `q`, `w`, and the list `M` remain unchanged as the code does not affect these variables or their conditions.
