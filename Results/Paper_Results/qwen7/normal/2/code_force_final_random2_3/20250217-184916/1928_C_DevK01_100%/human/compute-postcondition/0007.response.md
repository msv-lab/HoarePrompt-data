Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop condition is `i < w`.
3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= q < n <= 10^9).
   - `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q).
   - `M` is a list.
   - `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` if `w` is an integer, otherwise `M` remains unchanged.

4. **Check the current value of `i`**: `i` is currently 1.
5. **Determine the required value of `w`**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `w`. Since `i` is 1, `w` must be greater than 1.

Given the conditions, we need to ensure that `w` is an integer and greater than 1. Additionally, since `w` is the square root of `q`, `q` must be a perfect square and greater than 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `w` must be an integer greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, and `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer greater than 1**
