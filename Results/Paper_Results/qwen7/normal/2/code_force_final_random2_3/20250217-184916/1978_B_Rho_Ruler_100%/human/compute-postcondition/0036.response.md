Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). It calculates and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling some of the buns at the modified price (`b`). The function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price, ensuring the maximum profit is determined.**
