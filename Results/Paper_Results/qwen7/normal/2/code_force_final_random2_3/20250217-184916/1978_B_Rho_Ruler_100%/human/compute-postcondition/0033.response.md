Output State: `low` is greater than `high`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit found during the iterations, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are the profits at `mid` and `mid + 1` respectively, and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the condition `low <= high` will no longer be satisfied, meaning `low` will be greater than `high`. The variable `max_profit` will hold the highest profit found during the entire process of narrowing down the range. `mid` will be the last midpoint calculated, and `profit_mid` and `profit_next` will be the profits corresponding to `mid` and `mid + 1` in the final iteration. The value of `high` will be the minimum of `n` and `b`, as it is not changed once the loop terminates.
