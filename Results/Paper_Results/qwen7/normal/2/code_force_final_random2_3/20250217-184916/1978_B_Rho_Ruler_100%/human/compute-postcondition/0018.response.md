Output State: **`low` is set, `high` is set, `mid` is set to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `profit_next` to be the result of calling `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
