n is an integer representing the number of buns, a is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and b is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. Additionally, 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, and 0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b), where k is an integer chosen by Bob to maximize his profit.
