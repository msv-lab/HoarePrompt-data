Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `low` is 0, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `max_profit` is 0
Code of the loop:
while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
    profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
    max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
    if profit_next > profit_mid:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` are as follows: if `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `mid` is recalculated as `(0 + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are updated accordingly, and `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`. Otherwise, `low` remains 0, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, `mid` is recalculated as `(0 + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are updated accordingly, and `max_profit` is still the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `max_profit`, and `profit_next` are as follows: if `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` is recalculated as (`low` + `high`) // 2, `profit_mid` is updated to the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` is not updated. Otherwise, `low` remains unchanged, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, `mid` is recalculated as (`low` + `high`) // 2, `profit_mid` is updated to the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` is not updated.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2; `profit_mid` is the value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the value of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid` + 1 and `high` remains greater than or equal to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is updated to be less than or equal to `high` - 1 and `mid` is recalculated.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
