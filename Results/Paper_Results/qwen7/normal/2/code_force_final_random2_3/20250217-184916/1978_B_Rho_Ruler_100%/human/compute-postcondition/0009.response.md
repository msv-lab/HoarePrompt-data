Output State: **`low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `mid` is (0 + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`**.

Explanation: The variable `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The values of `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged from their previous states.
