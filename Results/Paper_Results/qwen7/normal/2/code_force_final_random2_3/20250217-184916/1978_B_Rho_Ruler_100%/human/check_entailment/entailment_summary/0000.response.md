Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the profit from selling buns by choosing an optimal number of buns \( k \) to be sold at a modified price. The modified price decreases linearly from \( b \) to \( b - k + 1 \).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the total profit for a given \( k \).
   - It correctly computes the profit from the first \( k \) buns using the formula \( k \times b - k \times (k - 1) / 2 \).
   - It adds the profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - The formula \( k \times b - k \times (k - 1) / 2 \) accounts for the decreasing price of the first \( k \) buns, which is correct.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function uses a binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes the search range from \( 0 \) to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - It iteratively narrows down the range using the midpoint \( mid \) and compares the profits for \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is greater, it moves the lower bound up; otherwise, it moves the upper bound down.
   - The function correctly updates the maximum profit found during the search.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_2`.
   - The input and output handling is correct, matching the problem statement requirements.
   - Both functions work together to solve the problem as described.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by using binary search and the correct profit calculation function.

Correctness: **True**
