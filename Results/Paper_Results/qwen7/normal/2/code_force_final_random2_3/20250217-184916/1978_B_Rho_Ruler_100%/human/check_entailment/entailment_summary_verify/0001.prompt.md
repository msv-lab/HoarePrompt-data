You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (0, min(n, b))
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return max_profit



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). It calculates and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling some of the buns at the modified price (`b`). The function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price, ensuring the maximum profit is determined.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal \( k \) such that the first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - The modified price for the \( i \)-th bun (where \( 1 \le i \le k \)) is \( b - i + 1 \).

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified prices is calculated by summing up the modified prices from \( b \) down to \( b - k + 1 \).
   - This can be expressed as \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \) (sum of the first \( k \) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \)).
   - The profit from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \) is \( (n - k) \cdot a \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the profit for a given \( k \), \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

4. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes the search range from \( 0 \) to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit for \( k = mid \) and \( k = mid + 1 \).
   - It updates the search range based on which profit is higher.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where \( k = 0 \) correctly by considering the usual price \( a \).

### Analysis of the Given Code:

- The `func_1` function correctly implements the profit calculation formula.
- The `func_2` function uses binary search to efficiently find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
- The logic inside the binary search loop is correct and ensures that the maximum profit is found.

### Conclusion:

Given the correct implementation of both functions and the proper use of binary search to find the optimal \( k \), the provided program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
