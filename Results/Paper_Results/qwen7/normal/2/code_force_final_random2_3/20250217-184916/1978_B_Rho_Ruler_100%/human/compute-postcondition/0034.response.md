Output State: **The program returns the maximum profit found during the iterations, which is stored in the variable `max_profit`.**

This means that after the loop has terminated because `low` is now greater than `high`, the function returns the highest profit (`max_profit`) that was found during the process of narrowing down the range. The other variables like `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `high` are not directly returned but are part of the context that led to the determination of `max_profit`.
