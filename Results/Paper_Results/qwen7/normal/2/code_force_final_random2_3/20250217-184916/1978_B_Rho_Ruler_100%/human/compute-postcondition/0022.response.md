Postcondition: **`low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `max_profit`, and `profit_next` are as follows: if `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, `high` remains unchanged, `mid` is recalculated as (`low` + `high`) // 2, `profit_mid` is updated to the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` is not updated. Otherwise, `low` remains unchanged, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, `mid` is recalculated as (`low` + `high`) // 2, `profit_mid` is updated to the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` is not updated.**
