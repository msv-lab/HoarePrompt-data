Postcondition: `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` are as follows: if `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `mid` is recalculated as `(0 + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, and `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`. Otherwise, `low` remains 0, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, `mid` is recalculated as `(0 + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, and `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
