The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` (1 ≤ length of `s` ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from `s`, counts the remaining occurrences of 'pie', and prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' from the original string `s`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
