Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user without the substring 'map', `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`.**

The code replaces all occurrences of the substring 'map' with an empty string in `s`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The updated state of `s` is the original `s` without the substring 'map'.
