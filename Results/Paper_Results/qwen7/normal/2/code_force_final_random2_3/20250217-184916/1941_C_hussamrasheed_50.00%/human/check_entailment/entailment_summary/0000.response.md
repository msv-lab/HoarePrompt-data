Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and then printing their sum. However, this approach is incorrect because:

1. **Removing Substrings**: The program removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s` using `s.replace('map', '')`. This operation changes the string `s`, which means that subsequent checks for "pie" will be performed on the modified string, not the original one.
   
2. **Counting Occurrences**: After removing "map", the program counts the remaining occurrences of "pie". This count is not relevant because the goal is to find the minimum number of characters to delete to make the string beautiful, not just to count the remaining "pie" after removing "map".

3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic should focus on finding the minimum deletions required to eliminate both "map" and "pie" entirely, rather than just counting them.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
