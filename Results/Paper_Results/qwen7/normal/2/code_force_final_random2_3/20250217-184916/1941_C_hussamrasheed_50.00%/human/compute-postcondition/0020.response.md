Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`**.

The code `m = s.count('map')` counts the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `m`. Since `s` is a string input by the user, the exact value of `m` cannot be determined without knowing the content of `s`. However, we know that `t` remains greater than 1, `i` remains 2, `n` remains an input integer, and `s` remains a string input by the user.
