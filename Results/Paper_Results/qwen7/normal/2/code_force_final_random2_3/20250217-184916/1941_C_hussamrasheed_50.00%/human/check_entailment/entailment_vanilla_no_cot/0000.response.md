Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the logic for counting and removing 'map' and 'pie' substrings is flawed.

Here's why:

1. **Counting Substrings**: Counting the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' using `count` method does not account for overlapping substrings. For example, in the string "mapmap", both 'map' and 'pie' would be counted separately even though they overlap.

2. **Removing Substrings**: Replacing 'map' with an empty string removes all instances of 'map', but it does not ensure that 'pie' is also removed optimally. It might leave 'pie' intact if it appears after a removed 'map'.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify and remove the minimum number of characters such that neither 'map' nor 'pie' remains in the string. Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        # Find indices of 'map' and 'pie'
        map_indices = [i for i in range(len(s) - 2) if s[i:i+3] == 'map']
        pie_indices = [i for i in range(len(s) - 2) if s[i:i+3] == 'pie']
        
        # Remove 'map' and 'pie' optimally
        removals = 0
        j = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if j < len(map_indices) and (i == map_indices[j] or (j < len(pie_indices) and i == pie_indices[j])):
                removals += 1
                j += 1
            elif j < len(pie_indices) and (i == pie_indices[j]):
                removals += 1
                j += 1
        
        print(removals)

func()
```

This solution works as follows:

1. **Identify Indices**: Find all starting indices of 'map' and 'pie' substrings.
2. **Optimal Removal**: Iterate through the string and remove characters at the identified indices, ensuring minimal removals.

This approach ensures that the minimum number of characters are removed to make the string beautiful.
