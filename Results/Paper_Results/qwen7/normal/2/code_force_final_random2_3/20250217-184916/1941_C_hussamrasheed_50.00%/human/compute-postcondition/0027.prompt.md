You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string s consists of lowercase Latin letters with a total length of n across all test cases not exceeding 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        m = s.count('map')
        
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        
        p = s.count('pie')
        
        print(m + p)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user without any occurrence of 'map', `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `t` (the total number of iterations), and for each iteration, the string `s` had all instances of 'map' removed, with `m` and `p` being the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in the original string `s`, respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, and the final state of `s` will reflect the last iteration's inputs and transformations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a total length of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) across all test cases not exceeding 10^6. For each test case, it returns information about the string `s` based on the value of `t`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
