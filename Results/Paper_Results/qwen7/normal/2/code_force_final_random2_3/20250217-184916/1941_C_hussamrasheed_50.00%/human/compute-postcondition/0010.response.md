Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user without the substring 'map', `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `n` is the integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input by the user to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
