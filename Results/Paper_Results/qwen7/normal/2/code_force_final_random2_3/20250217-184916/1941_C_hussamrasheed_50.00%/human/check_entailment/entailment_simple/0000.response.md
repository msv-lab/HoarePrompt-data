Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The logic in the program attempts to count the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and then prints their sum. However, this approach does not ensure that the string is made beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. Instead, it simply removes all occurrences of "map" and then counts the remaining occurrences of "pie". This does not guarantee the minimum deletions required to make the string beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, we should iterate through the string and remove characters dynamically to avoid both "map" and "pie" substrings, keeping track of the minimum deletions needed. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Correctness: **False**
