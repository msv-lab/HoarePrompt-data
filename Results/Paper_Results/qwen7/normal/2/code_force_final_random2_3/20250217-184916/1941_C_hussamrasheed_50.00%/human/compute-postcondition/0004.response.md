Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`**.

The code `m = s.count('map')` counts the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `m`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
