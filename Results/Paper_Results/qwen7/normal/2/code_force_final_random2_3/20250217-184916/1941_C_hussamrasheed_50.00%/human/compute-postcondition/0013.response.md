Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the string input by the user without any occurrence of 'map', `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**

Explanation: The code replaces all occurrences of the substring 'map' with an empty string in `s`. Therefore, `s` no longer contains any 'map'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
