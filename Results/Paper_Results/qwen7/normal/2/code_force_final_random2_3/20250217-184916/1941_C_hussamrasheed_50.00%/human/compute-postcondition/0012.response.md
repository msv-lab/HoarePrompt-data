Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the string input by the user, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s', `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `m = s.count('map')` counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s` and assigns the result to the variable `m`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `p`) remain unchanged.
