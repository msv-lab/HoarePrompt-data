Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the string input by the user without any occurrence of 'map', `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**

The code `p = s.count('pie')` counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `p`. Since `s` does not contain the substring 'map', the value of `p` will be 0 if 'pie' does not appear in `s`, or it will be the number of times 'pie' appears in `s` if it does. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
