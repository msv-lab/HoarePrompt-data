Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program counts the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the modified string `s` after removing all 'map' substrings. However, the goal is to find the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful, which means the string should not contain either 'pie' or 'map'. 

Here's the correct approach:
1. Iterate through the string `s` and keep track of the indices where 'pie' or 'map' appear.
2. Use these indices to calculate the minimum deletions needed to remove all occurrences of 'pie' or 'map'.

The current implementation incorrectly calculates the result by counting 'map' and 'pie' in the modified string, which does not reflect the minimum deletions required.

Correctness: **False**
