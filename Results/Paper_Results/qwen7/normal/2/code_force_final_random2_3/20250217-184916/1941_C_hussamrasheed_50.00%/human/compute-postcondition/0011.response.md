Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the string input by the user, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**

The code `s = input()` updates the variable `s` to be the string input by the user. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
