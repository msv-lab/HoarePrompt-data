The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on a specific formula involving \(a\) and \(i\) (where \(i\) ranges from 1 to \(b\)). The final output is the cumulative sum of these calculations for all test cases. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
