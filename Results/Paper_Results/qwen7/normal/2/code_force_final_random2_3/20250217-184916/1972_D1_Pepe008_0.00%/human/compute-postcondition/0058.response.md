Output State: **`info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a`, `suma` is `x`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` and the current value of `x` is greater than 0, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`.**

Explanation: The line `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Since `x` is defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` and is greater than 0, `suma` now holds the value of its previous value plus `x`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
