Output State: **`info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a + 3`, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is \((a - (a + 3) \cdot (a + 2)) // (a + 3) + 1, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `suma += x` updates the value of `suma` by adding `x` to its current value. Given the expression for `x` as \((a - (a + 3) \cdot (a + 2)) // (a + 3) + 1\), `suma` is now the sum of its original value and this updated `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
