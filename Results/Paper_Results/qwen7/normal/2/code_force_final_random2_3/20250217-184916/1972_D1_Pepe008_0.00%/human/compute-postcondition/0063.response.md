Output State: **`info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a + 1`, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`.**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` updates the value of `suma` by adding `x` to its current value. The value of `x` is given by the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Since `i` is `a + 1`, substituting `i` in the expression gives us `x = (a - (a + 1) * a // (a + 1))`. Simplifying this, we get `x = (a - a * (a + 1) // (a + 1)) = (a - a) = 0`. Therefore, `suma` is updated by adding 0 to its original value, meaning `suma` remains unchanged. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
