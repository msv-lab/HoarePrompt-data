Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over possible values of `i` from 1 to `b` and calculating a sum based on a specific formula. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used in the program, `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, does not correctly implement the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Range of `i`**: The inner loop should iterate over possible values of `a` and check the condition for each pair `(a, b)`.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The program does not calculate the GCD of `a` and `i` within the loop, which is necessary to check the condition.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `a` or `b` are very large.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
