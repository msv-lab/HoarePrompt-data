Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the formula used in the loop to calculate `x` does not accurately determine the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

To illustrate this, let's consider a specific example:

- For the input `10 8`, the expected output is `14`. However, the program outputs a different value.

Let's manually check a few pairs to see why the program might be incorrect:

1. For `a = 1` and `b = 1`:
   - `a + b = 2` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
   - Since `2 % 1 == 0`, `(1, 1)` is a valid pair.

2. For `a = 2` and `b = 1`:
   - `a + b = 3` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
   - Since `3 % 1 == 0`, `(2, 1)` is a valid pair.

3. For `a = 2` and `b = 2`:
   - `a + b = 4` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 2 * 2 = 4`.
   - Since `4 % 4 == 0`, `(2, 2)` is a valid pair.

4. For `a = 3` and `b = 1`:
   - `a + b = 4` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
   - Since `4 % 1 == 0`, `(3, 1)` is a valid pair.

5. For `a = 4` and `b = 1`:
   - `a + b = 5` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
   - Since `5 % 1 == 0`, `(4, 1)` is a valid pair.

6. For `a = 5` and `b = 1`:
   - `a + b = 6` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
   - Since `6 % 1 == 0`, `(5, 1)` is a valid pair.

7. For `a = 6` and `b = 1`:
   - `a + b = 7` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
   - Since `7 % 1 == 0`, `(6, 1)` is a valid pair.

8. For `a = 6` and `b = 2`:
   - `a + b = 8` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 2 * 2 = 4`.
   - Since `8 % 4 == 0`, `(6, 2)` is a valid pair.

9. For `a = 6` and `b = 3`:
   - `a + b = 9` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 3 * 3 = 9`.
   - Since `9 % 9 == 0`, `(6, 3)` is a valid pair.

10. For `a = 7` and `b = 1`:
    - `a + b = 8` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
    - Since `8 % 1 == 0`, `(7, 1)` is a valid pair.

11. For `a = 8` and `b = 1`:
    - `a + b = 9` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
    - Since `9 % 1 == 0`, `(8, 1)` is a valid pair.

12. For `a = 9` and `b = 1`:
    - `a + b = 10` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
    - Since `10 % 1 == 0`, `(9, 1)` is a valid pair.

13. For `a = 10` and `b = 1`:
    - `a + b = 11` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
    - Since `11 % 1 == 0`, `(10, 1)` is a valid pair.

14. For `a = 10` and `b = 2`:
    - `a + b = 12` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 2 * 2 = 4`.
    - Since `12 % 4 == 0`, `(10, 2)` is a valid pair.

The program fails to correctly count these pairs, indicating that the logic used in the loop to calculate `x` is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
