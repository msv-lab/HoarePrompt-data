Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for t in range(T)`. The variables involved here are `t` and `T`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` does not exceed `b`. However, since `t` is the loop variable, we need to focus on how `t` and `T` change within the loop.

3. **Understand the given states**:
   - After all iterations, `t` remains 0.
   - `T` remains greater than 0.
   - `a` remains `int(info[0])`.
   - `b` remains its initial value.
   - `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
   - `i` will be `b + 1` after the loop completes.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `t` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, if the loop is to continue, `t` must be 0 initially and will become 1 after the first iteration.
   - `T` remains greater than 0, so it doesn't change for the next iteration.
   - `a` remains `int(info[0])`, so it doesn't change.
   - `b` remains its initial value, so it doesn't change.
   - `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations, but it doesn't affect the loop continuation directly.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `t` and `T`.

**State: **`t` is 0, `T` must be greater than 0, `a` remains `int(info[0])`, `b` remains its initial value**
