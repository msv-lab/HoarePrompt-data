You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #State: Output State: All variables outside the loop, including `T`, `a`, and `b`, retain their final values from the last iteration. Specifically, `t` equals `T-1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations. `a` and `b` hold the values from the last input `info` provided. The variable `suma` contains the cumulative sum of `x` values calculated over all iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `b`. After the loop completes, `i` would be `b + 1` for the next potential iteration, but since the loop has finished, `i` is no longer tracked individually.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes all its iterations, `T` will be decremented by the number of times the loop ran, `a` and `b` will be the values from the last input, and `suma` will be the total sum of `x` values calculated throughout all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the formula used in the loop to calculate `x` does not accurately determine the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

To illustrate this, let's consider a specific example:

- For the input `10 8`, the expected output is `14`. However, the program outputs a different value.

Let's manually check a few pairs to see why the program might be incorrect:

1. For `a = 1` and `b = 1`:
   - `a + b = 2` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
   - Since `2 % 1 == 0`, `(1, 1)` is a valid pair.

2. For `a = 2` and `b = 1`:
   - `a + b = 3` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
   - Since `3 % 1 == 0`, `(2, 1)` is a valid pair.

3. For `a = 2` and `b = 2`:
   - `a + b = 4` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 2 * 2 = 4`.
   - Since `4 % 4 == 0`, `(2, 2)` is a valid pair.

4. For `a = 3` and `b = 1`:
   - `a + b = 4` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
   - Since `4 % 1 == 0`, `(3, 1)` is a valid pair.

5. For `a = 4` and `b = 1`:
   - `a + b = 5` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
   - Since `5 % 1 == 0`, `(4, 1)` is a valid pair.

6. For `a = 5` and `b = 1`:
   - `a + b = 6` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
   - Since `6 % 1 == 0`, `(5, 1)` is a valid pair.

7. For `a = 6` and `b = 1`:
   - `a + b = 7` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
   - Since `7 % 1 == 0`, `(6, 1)` is a valid pair.

8. For `a = 6` and `b = 2`:
   - `a + b = 8` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 2 * 2 = 4`.
   - Since `8 % 4 == 0`, `(6, 2)` is a valid pair.

9. For `a = 6` and `b = 3`:
   - `a + b = 9` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 3 * 3 = 9`.
   - Since `9 % 9 == 0`, `(6, 3)` is a valid pair.

10. For `a = 7` and `b = 1`:
    - `a + b = 8` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
    - Since `8 % 1 == 0`, `(7, 1)` is a valid pair.

11. For `a = 8` and `b = 1`:
    - `a + b = 9` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
    - Since `9 % 1 == 0`, `(8, 1)` is a valid pair.

12. For `a = 9` and `b = 1`:
    - `a + b = 10` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
    - Since `10 % 1 == 0`, `(9, 1)` is a valid pair.

13. For `a = 10` and `b = 1`:
    - `a + b = 11` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
    - Since `11 % 1 == 0`, `(10, 1)` is a valid pair.

14. For `a = 10` and `b = 2`:
    - `a + b = 12` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 2 * 2 = 4`.
    - Since `12 % 4 == 0`, `(10, 2)` is a valid pair.

The program fails to correctly count these pairs, indicating that the logic used in the loop to calculate `x` is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
