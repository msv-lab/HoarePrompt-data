Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is 2, `(a - 6)` is greater than 0**.

Explanation: 
- The value of `x` is calculated as \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
- Given `i` is 3, substitute \(i\) into the equation: \((a - 3 \times (3 - 1)) // 3^2 + 1 = (a - 3 \times 2) // 9 + 1 = (a - 6) // 9 + 1\).
- Since \((a - 6)\) is greater than 0, let's assume \((a - 6) = k\) where \(k > 0\). So, \(x = k // 9 + 1\).
- For simplicity, let's assume \(k = 7\) (since \(k > 0\) and the smallest possible value for \(k\) given the condition is 1, but to keep it simple and specific, we can take 7), then \(x = 7 // 9 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\), but since \(k\) is greater than 6 and less than 9, the only integer solution fitting all conditions is when \(k = 7\), thus \(x = 1\).
- However, to be more general and adhere to the condition that \((a - 6)\) is greater than 0, we can say \(x = 1\), but the most specific and correct answer considering the exact calculation is \(x = 2\) when \(k = 8\), which is the next integer fitting the condition.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
