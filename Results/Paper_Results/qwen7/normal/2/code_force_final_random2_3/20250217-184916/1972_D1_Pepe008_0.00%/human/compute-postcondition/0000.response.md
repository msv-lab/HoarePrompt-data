Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is within the range 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specified that `t` (which is now `T`) is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the code only changes the value of `T` to an input integer, the output state reflects that `T` is now the input integer and remains within the same range. All other conditions and constraints on `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
