Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `i` is `k + 2`, `suma` is increased by `x`, and `x` is `(a - (k + 2) * (k + 1)) // (k + 2) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` increments the value of `suma` by the current value of `x`. The value of `x` is defined as `(a - (k + 2) * (k + 1)) // (k + 2) + 1`. The values of `b`, `i`, and `suma` are updated according to their respective definitions, while the value of `x` remains as per its calculation.
