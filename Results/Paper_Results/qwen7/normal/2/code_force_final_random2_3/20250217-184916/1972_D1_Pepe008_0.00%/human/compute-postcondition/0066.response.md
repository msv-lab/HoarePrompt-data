Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `b` in the `for i in range(1, b + 1):` statement.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `b` is an integer at least 3.
   - `i` is `a + 1`.
   - `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`.
   - `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`.
   - `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`.
   - `b` must be at least 1.
   - `x` is \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i\).
   - `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`. If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), then `x` is added to `suma`; otherwise, the value of `suma` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `a + 1` and increases by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `a + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, `i` should be `a + 3` in the next iteration.
   - `b` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be updated to `a + 3`.
   - `b` remains the same.

6. **Construct the New State**:
   - `info` remains the same.
   - `b` remains the same.
   - `i` is now `a + 3`.
   - `suma` remains the same.
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `b` remains the same.
   - `x` will be recalculated based on the new `i` value, but since we are only adjusting the loop head, we don't need to specify the exact value of `x` here.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a + 3`, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i\), `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`. If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), then `x` is added to `suma`; otherwise, the value of `suma` remains unchanged.**
