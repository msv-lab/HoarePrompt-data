Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` must be greater than 0, `a` remains `int(info[0])`, `b` remains its initial value, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `info`. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
