Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Test Cases and Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - It splits the input string to get `n` and `m`.

2. **Iterating Over Possible Pairs:**
   - The original intention was to iterate over all possible pairs `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i ≤ n` and `1 ≤ j ≤ m`.
   - However, the code snippet inside the comment block is not executed. Instead, the program uses a different logic to calculate the number of valid pairs.

3. **Alternative Logic:**
   - The program iterates over `i` from `1` to `b` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's compare this logic with the problem statement:

- The problem requires checking pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The provided logic does not directly check this condition. Instead, it uses a different approach which seems to be an approximation or simplification.

### Example Verification

Let's manually verify the logic with the example provided:

- For the test case `n = 10`, `m = 8`:
  - The expected output is `14`.
  - The actual output is `14`.

By manually checking a few more examples, we can see that the logic does not match the expected behavior. Specifically, the formula used in the program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
