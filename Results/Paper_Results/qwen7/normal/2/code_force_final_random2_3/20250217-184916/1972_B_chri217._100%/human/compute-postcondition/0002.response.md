The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `case`, which is a list of length 2. The first element of `case` is an integer representing the number of coins (`n`), and the second element is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins (facing up or down). If the count of 'U' in the second element of `case` is even, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list `case` and return 'YES' if the count of 'U' in the second element of `case` is even, otherwise return 'NO'.
