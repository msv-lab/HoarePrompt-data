You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of coins, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n consisting of only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        
        cases.append((n, s))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer input from stdin for each iteration; `s` is the string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration; `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(n, s)` where `n` and `s` are the last values read from stdin during the loop's final iteration.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `cases` will contain `t` tuples, with each tuple holding the most recent `n` and `s` values read from stdin for each of the `t` test cases. The value of `t` itself will be reduced to 0 after all iterations since it starts as the number of test cases and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
    return cases
    #The program returns a list named 'cases' which contains 't' tuples. Each tuple consists of the last values of 'n' and 's' read from stdin for each of the 't' test cases. After all iterations, 't' is reduced to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes 't' test cases, where 't' is an integer within the range 1 to 100. For each test case, it reads an integer 'n' and a string 's' of length 'n'. It then returns a list named 'cases' containing 't' tuples. Each tuple includes the last values of 'n' and 's' read from standard input for each test case. After processing all test cases, 't' is reduced to 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named 'cases' which contains 't' tuples. Each tuple consists of the last values of 'n' and 's' read from stdin for each of the 't' test cases. After all iterations, 't' is reduced to 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
