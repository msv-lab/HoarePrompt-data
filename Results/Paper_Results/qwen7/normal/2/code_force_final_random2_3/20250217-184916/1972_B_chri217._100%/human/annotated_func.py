#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of coins, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n consisting of only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        
        cases.append((n, s))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer input from stdin for each iteration; `s` is the string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration; `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(n, s)` where `n` and `s` are the last values read from stdin during the loop's final iteration.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `cases` will contain `t` tuples, with each tuple holding the most recent `n` and `s` values read from stdin for each of the `t` test cases. The value of `t` itself will be reduced to 0 after all iterations since it starts as the number of test cases and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
    return cases
    #The program returns a list named 'cases' which contains 't' tuples. Each tuple consists of the last values of 'n' and 's' read from stdin for each of the 't' test cases. After all iterations, 't' is reduced to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a specified number of test cases (up to 100) where each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. These values represent the number of coins and their initial orientation (either "U" or "D"), respectively. The function collects these values into a list of tuples, with each tuple containing the last `n` and `s` values read from standard input for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variable `t`, which initially holds the number of test cases, is reduced to 0. The function returns the list of tuples.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a list of length 2, where the first element is an integer representing the number of coins (n), and the second element is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins (facing up or down).
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #'YES' if the count of 'U' in the second element of 'case' is even, otherwise 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `case` containing two elements: an integer representing the number of coins and a string of length n consisting of "U" and "D". It counts the number of "U" characters in the string and returns 'YES' if this count is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'.
