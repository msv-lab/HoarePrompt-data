Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's how they work together to solve the problem:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - Stores each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` in a list `cases`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Takes a single test case `(n, s)` as input.
   - Counts the number of coins facing up (`ups`) using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
   - Determines the winner based on whether the count of facing-up coins is even or odd:
     - If `ups % 2 == 0`, returns `'NO'` (indicating Bob wins).
     - Otherwise, returns `'YES'` (indicating Alice wins).

Given the rules of the game, the key observation is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner when both players play optimally. This is because:
- Removing a facing-up coin and flipping its neighbors changes the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
- The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who makes the last move wins.

The provided implementation correctly counts the number of facing-up coins and determines the winner based on this count. Therefore, the solution is correct.
