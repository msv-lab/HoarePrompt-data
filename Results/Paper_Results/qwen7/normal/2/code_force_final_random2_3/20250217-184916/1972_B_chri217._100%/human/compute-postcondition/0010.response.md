Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer input from stdin.
   - `s` is the string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `cases` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(t, <initial value of s>)` and the second tuple is `(n, s)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, we need to decrement `t` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`n`, `s`, and `cases`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is decreased by 1 (so it is now `t - 1`).
- `n` remains the same.
- `s` remains the same.
- `cases` remains the same.

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `n` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is the string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `cases` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(t, <initial value of s>)` and the second tuple is `(n, s)`**.
