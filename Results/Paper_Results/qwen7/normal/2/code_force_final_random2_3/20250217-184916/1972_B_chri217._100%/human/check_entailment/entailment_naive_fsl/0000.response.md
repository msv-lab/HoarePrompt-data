Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are exactly two coins left and one of them is facing up. According to the problem description, if there are only two coins left and one is facing up, the player should remove the facing-up coin and flip the other coin, which means the remaining coin should be facing down. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly.

For example, consider the input:

```
3
2
UU
```

The expected output should be "YES" because Alice can remove one of the facing-up coins, leaving the other coin facing down, and Bob will lose. However, the current implementation will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not handle the case where there are exactly two coins left and one is facing up.

To fix this, the program needs to check if there are exactly two coins left and one is facing up, and handle this case appropriately.
