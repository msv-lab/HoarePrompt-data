Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins and their orientations.
- There are two functions defined: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` correctly reads the input for multiple test cases and organizes them into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of coins and the string representing their initial orientations.
- `func_2` calculates whether the number of coins facing up ("U") is even or odd. According to the problem statement, if the number of "U" coins is even, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
- The logic in `func_2` matches the problem's requirements perfectly.
- The overall structure of the program ensures that for each test case, the appropriate result is printed based on the parity of the number of "U" coins.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
