Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer input from stdin.
   - `s` is a string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure `t` is decremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - After each iteration, `t` should be reduced by 1. Therefore, if `t` was greater than 0 before the iteration, it will be `t - 1` after the iteration.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (decreased by 1).
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `cases` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (decreased by 1), `n` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is a string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**
