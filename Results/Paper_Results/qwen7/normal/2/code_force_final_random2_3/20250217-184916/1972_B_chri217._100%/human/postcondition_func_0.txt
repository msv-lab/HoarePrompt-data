The function processes a specified number of test cases (up to 100) where each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. These values represent the number of coins and their initial orientation (either "U" or "D"), respectively. The function collects these values into a list of tuples, with each tuple containing the last `n` and `s` values read from standard input for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variable `t`, which initially holds the number of test cases, is reduced to 0. The function returns the list of tuples.
