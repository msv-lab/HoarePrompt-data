Reasoning:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins. It stores these values in a list of tuples `cases`, where each tuple contains `n` and `s`. After processing all test cases, the function returns the list `cases`.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function takes a tuple `case` from the list `cases` and counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`. It returns "YES" if the count of "U" is even, and "NO" if it is odd. According to the problem statement, the game is decided based on the parity of the number of coins facing up at the start. If the number of "U" is even, Alice wins; if it is odd, Bob wins.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the logic in `func_2` aligns with the rules of the game. The function correctly determines the winner based on the initial state of the coins.

Therefore, the overall program is correct because both functions work together to process the test cases and determine the winner based on the given rules.

Correctness: **True**
