Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1; `n` is an integer input from stdin; `s` is the string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `cases` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is `(t-1, s)`, the second tuple is `(n, s)`, and the third tuple is `(n, s)`**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`. Initially, `cases` contains two tuples: `(t-1, s)` and `(n, s)`. After executing the code, `cases` now contains three tuples: `(t-1, s)`, `(n, s)`, and `(n, s)`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged except that `t` is now `t-1`.
