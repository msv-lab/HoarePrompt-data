### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the annotated code and the logic used in `func_1()` to determine if the program correctly calculates the maximum balance of the problemset.

1. **Function Logic Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1()` takes two integers `x` and `n` as input.
   - It iterates over all integers from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1` (inclusive).
   - For each integer `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
   - If `x` is divisible by `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to `x // i`.

2. **Key Points to Validate:**
   - The program aims to find the maximum balance, which is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.
   - The logic checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `n` is less than or equal to `i`. This ensures that the number of sub-problems can be evenly divided among the difficulties.
   - The program only considers divisors of `x` up to `isqrt(x) + 1`, which is a reasonable optimization since any larger divisor would have a corresponding smaller divisor.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the example provided: `420 69`.
     - The divisors of 420 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420.
     - The largest divisor of 420 that is less than or equal to `isqrt(420) + 1` (which is approximately 21) is 7.
     - If we distribute the 420 difficulty into 69 sub-problems, the optimal distribution would indeed be 7 for each sub-problem, resulting in a GCD of 7.
     - The program correctly identifies 7 as the maximum balance.

4. **General Case Validation:**
   - For any input `x` and `n`, the program checks all divisors of `x` up to `isqrt(x) + 1` and ensures that the number of sub-problems can be evenly divided among the difficulties.
   - The logic ensures that the maximum balance is found by considering the largest possible divisor that meets the condition.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. The original assessment was inaccurate because the program does indeed consider all necessary conditions to maximize the GCD.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
