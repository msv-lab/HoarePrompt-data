The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers \(x\) and \(n\). For each test case, it finds the largest divisor of \(x\) that is less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) and satisfies one of two conditions: \(n \leq \frac{x}{i}\) or \(n > i\). The function then prints the largest such divisor for each test case.
