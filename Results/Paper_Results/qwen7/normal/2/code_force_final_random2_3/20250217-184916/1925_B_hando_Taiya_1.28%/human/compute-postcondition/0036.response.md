Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is defined as `isqrt(x) + 1`, where `isqrt(x)` is the integer square root of `x`. This means `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
   - `ans` is the maximum value found during the loop, which is the largest integer `i` such that `x` is divisible by `i` and either `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `n` is greater than `i`.

2. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - The loop likely iterates over potential divisors of `x`, starting from `i` downwards.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i` and whether the condition `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `n` is greater than `i`.
   - The maximum value of `i` that satisfies these conditions is stored in `ans`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement simply outputs the value of `ans`.

Given the constraints and the definition of `ans`, the value of `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the given condition involving `n`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to sqrt(x) and satisfies the condition n <= x//i or n > i)**
