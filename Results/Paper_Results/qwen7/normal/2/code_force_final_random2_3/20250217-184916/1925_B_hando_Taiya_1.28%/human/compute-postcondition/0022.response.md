Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and either `i` (if `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`) or `x // i` (if `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is greater than `i`).
