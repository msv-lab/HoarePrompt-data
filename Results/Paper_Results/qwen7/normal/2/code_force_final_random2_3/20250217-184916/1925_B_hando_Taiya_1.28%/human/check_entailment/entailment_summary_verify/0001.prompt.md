You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers \(x\) and \(n\). For each test case, it finds the largest divisor of \(x\) that is less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) and satisfies one of two conditions: \(n \leq \frac{x}{i}\) or \(n > i\). The function then prints the largest such divisor for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main logic. This function is not called anywhere in the code, which means it is redundant and does not contribute to solving the problem.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program reads two integers `x` and `n` using `list(map(int, input().split()))`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
   - The program then iterates over possible values of `i` from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1` (inclusive).
     - If `x % i == 0`, it checks two conditions:
       - If `n <= x // i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
       - If `n <= i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The program aims to find the maximum GCD (balance) of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`.
   - The logic correctly checks all possible divisors of `x` and ensures that the number of sub-problems (`n`) is feasible for each divisor.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `n` is greater than `x // i` and vice versa.
   - It ensures that the GCD is maximized by considering both `i` and `x // i`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. It handles all necessary conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
