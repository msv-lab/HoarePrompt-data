Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main logic. This function is not called anywhere in the code, which means it is redundant and does not contribute to solving the problem.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program reads two integers `x` and `n` using `list(map(int, input().split()))`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
   - The program then iterates over possible values of `i` from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1` (inclusive).
     - If `x % i == 0`, it checks two conditions:
       - If `n <= x // i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
       - If `n <= i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The program aims to find the maximum GCD (balance) of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`.
   - The logic correctly checks all possible divisors of `x` and ensures that the number of sub-problems (`n`) is feasible for each divisor.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `n` is greater than `x // i` and vice versa.
   - It ensures that the GCD is maximized by considering both `i` and `x // i`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. It handles all necessary conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
