Reasoning:
1. The program aims to find the maximum balance of the problemset, which is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems.
2. The logic implemented in `func_1` is to iterate through all divisors of \(x\) up to \(\sqrt{x}\).
3. For each divisor \(i\), it checks two conditions:
   - If \(n \leq \frac{x}{i}\), it means we can have at least \(n\) sub-problems each with difficulty \(i\).
   - If \(n > i\), it means we can have at most \(i\) sub-problems each with difficulty \(\frac{x}{i}\).
4. It updates the answer (`ans`) with the maximum divisor found that satisfies either condition.
5. The program correctly prints the maximum balance for each test case.

Given the execution summary and the explanation of the code, the logic seems to be correct. The program should work as intended for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
