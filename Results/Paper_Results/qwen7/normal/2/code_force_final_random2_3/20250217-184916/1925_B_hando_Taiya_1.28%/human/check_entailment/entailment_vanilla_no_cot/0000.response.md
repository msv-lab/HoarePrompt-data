Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1` is not used**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called within the main loop where the test cases are processed. This means the program does not actually read any input or produce any output for the test cases.

2. **Incorrect logic for calculating the maximum balance**: The logic in `func_1` attempts to find the maximum GCD (balance) by iterating through possible divisors of `x`. However, the logic is flawed because it only checks if `n` is less than or equal to either `x // i` or `i`, which doesn't guarantee finding the maximum GCD.

3. **Missing handling of edge cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` is greater than `x`.

### Corrected Program:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd, isqrt

def func_1(x, n):
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    return ans

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(x, n))
```

This corrected program:
- Calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
- Fixes the logic to ensure the maximum GCD is found by checking both `x // i` and `i`.
- Handles the input and output correctly for multiple test cases.
