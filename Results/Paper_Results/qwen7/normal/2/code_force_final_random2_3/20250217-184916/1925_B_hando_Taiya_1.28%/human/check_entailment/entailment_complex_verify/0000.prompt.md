You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `isqrt(x) + 1`, `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), and `ans` is the maximum value found during the loop, which is the largest integer `i` such that `x` is divisible by `i` and either `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `n` is greater than `i`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `ans` will hold the greatest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)` and also satisfies the condition related to `n`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to sqrt(x) and satisfies the condition n <= x//i or n > i)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers \(x\) and \(n\). For each test case, it finds the largest divisor of \(x\) that is less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) and satisfies one of two conditions: \(n \leq \frac{x}{i}\) or \(n > i\). The function then prints the largest such divisor for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum balance of the problemset. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the maximum balance. Specifically, the program checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` and `i`, but it does not ensure that the difficulties are distributed optimally to maximize the GCD.

For example, consider the input:
```
420 69
```
The correct output should be 6, because the optimal distribution of difficulties would be 7 for each of the 69 sub-problems, making the GCD 7. However, the program does not account for this scenario correctly.

The program should consider all possible ways to distribute the difficulties and choose the one that maximizes the GCD. A more appropriate approach would involve checking all divisors of `x` and ensuring that the number of sub-problems can be evenly divided among them.
