Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` has at least one element and the last element of `bigList` must be the same as the last element of `smallList` before it was reduced by one.**

Explanation: The code `bigList.pop()` removes the last element from the `bigList`. The precondition that the last element of `bigList` must be the same as the last element of `smallList` before it was reduced by one remains unchanged. Therefore, the last element of `bigList` is still the same as the last element of `smallList`.
