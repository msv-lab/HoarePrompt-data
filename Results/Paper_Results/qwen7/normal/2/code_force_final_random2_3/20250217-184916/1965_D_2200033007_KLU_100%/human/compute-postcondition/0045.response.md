Output State: **The program returns a list of sorted cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list 'a'. The length of this list is equal to the length of 'a', and each element in the list represents the sum of elements starting from the corresponding index to the end of the list 'a', sorted in ascending order.**

This means that if `a` is a list of integers, the program returns a new list where each element is the sum of all elements from its position to the end of the list `a`, and this list is sorted in ascending order.
