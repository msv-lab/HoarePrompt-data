Output State: **`sm` is equal to its previous value plus `a[j]`, `j` remains unchanged, `cts` is a list with the appended value of `sm + a[j]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` by adding `a[j]` to its current value. Since `j` remains unchanged, its value stays the same. The list `cts` is updated by appending the new value of `sm`. Therefore, the new state includes the updated `sm`, the unchanged `j`, and the updated `cts` with the appended value of `sm + a[j]`.
