Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` is the current value of `x` from the previous iteration, `idx` is either `-1` or `((n - 1) // 2 - 1)`, and `a[idx]` is set to `x`.**

This means that the value of `a` at index `idx` has been updated to `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
