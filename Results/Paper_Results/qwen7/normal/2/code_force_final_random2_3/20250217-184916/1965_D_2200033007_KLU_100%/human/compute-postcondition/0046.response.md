Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter 'a', which is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array. The length of 'a' is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\), where \(n\) is the size of the unknown palindrome array. The function returns a list of sorted cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list 'a'. The length of this list is equal to the length of 'a', and each element in the list represents the sum of elements starting from the corresponding index to the end of the list 'a', sorted in ascending order.**
