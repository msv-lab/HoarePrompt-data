Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` is the value of `x` from the previous iteration, `a[idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`, `idx` is `idx - 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the element `a[n - 1 - idx]` to the value of `(x - prev) // 2`. This means that the value of `a[idx]` (which was previously `a[n - 1 - idx]`) is now `(x - prev) // 2`. Additionally, `idx` is decremented by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
