You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array, and the length of a is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) where \(n\) is the size of the unknown palindrome array.
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
        
    #State: `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(a)`, `sm` is the sum of all elements from index `0` to the end of the list `a`, and `cts` is a list containing all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`.
    cts.sort()
    return cts
    #The program returns a list of sorted cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list 'a'. The length of this list is equal to the length of 'a', and each element in the list represents the sum of elements starting from the corresponding index to the end of the list 'a', sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter 'a', which is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array. The length of 'a' is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\), where \(n\) is the size of the unknown palindrome array. The function returns a list of sorted cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list 'a'. The length of this list is equal to the length of 'a', and each element in the list represents the sum of elements starting from the corresponding index to the end of the list 'a', sorted in ascending order.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of sorted cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list 'a'. The length of this list is equal to the length of 'a', and each element in the list represents the sum of elements starting from the corresponding index to the end of the list 'a', sorted in ascending order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
