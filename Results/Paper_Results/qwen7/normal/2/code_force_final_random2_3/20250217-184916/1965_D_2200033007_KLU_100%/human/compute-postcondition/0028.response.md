Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` is the value of `x` from the previous iteration, `idx` is the value of `idx` decremented by 1.**

In this case, the code simply decrements the value of `idx` by 1. The lists and variables `odds` and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states.
