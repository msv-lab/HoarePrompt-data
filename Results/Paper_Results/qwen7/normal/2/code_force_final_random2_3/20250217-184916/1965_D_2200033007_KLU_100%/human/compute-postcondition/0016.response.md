Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` is the current value of `x` from the previous iteration, `idx` is either `-1` or `((n - 1) // 2 - 1)`, `a[idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2**.

This means that the value of `a` at index `idx` has been updated to the value of `(x - prev) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
