Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a` and returns them sorted. This is a correct implementation and does not affect the correctness of the main logic.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function removes duplicate elements from the list `cts` and ensures that each element appears only once. This is also correctly implemented and does not affect the overall correctness.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums stored in `odds`. It correctly populates the array by ensuring symmetry around the middle element. This function is crucial for generating a valid palindrome array.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the complete list of subarray sums (`bigList`) with the list of given subarray sums (`smallList`). If the last elements of both lists are the same, it removes them; otherwise, it returns the last element of `bigList`. This function is used to identify the missing subarray sum.

5. **Main Logic**: The main logic of the program correctly identifies the missing subarray sum and uses it to generate a valid palindrome array. The steps are as follows:
   - Sort the subarray sums.
   - Identify the missing sum using the functions `func_3` and `func_4`.
   - Append the missing sum to the list of unique subarray sums.
   - Reconstruct the palindrome array using `func_3`.

Given the detailed explanation and the structure of the program, the logic appears to be sound and should work as intended for the problem statement provided. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
