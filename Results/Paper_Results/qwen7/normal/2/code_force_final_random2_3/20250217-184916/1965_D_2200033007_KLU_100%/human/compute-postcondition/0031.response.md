Output State: **The program returns an array 'a' populated based on the values in the 'odds' list. For each 'x' in 'odds', if 'idx' equals 'n - 1 - idx', the middle element of 'a' is updated to 'x'. Otherwise, the elements symmetrically positioned around the center of 'a' are updated to \((x - prev) // 2\), with 'prev' being the value of 'x' from the previous iteration. The 'prev' variable holds the last value of 'x' from the 'odds' list, and 'idx' is set to \(-1\).**

This means that the array `a` is constructed following the specified rules using the values from the `odds` list, with the `prev` variable holding the last value processed and `idx` being \(-1\).
