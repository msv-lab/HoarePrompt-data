Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.
- `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
- `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`.

Let's break down the calculation of `p` and `res`:

1. **Calculation of `p`:**
   - `p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1`
   - This formula calculates the middle index of the list `a` if `n` is odd, or slightly left of the middle if `n` is even.

2. **Calculation of `res`:**
   - `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`.
   - Since `a` is sorted, if there are multiple identical elements, they will be grouped together.

Given these calculations, the print statement `print(res)` will output the count of how many times the element at index `p` appears in the sorted list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the count of elements in the sorted list `a` that are equal to the element at index (n + 1) // 2 - 1)**
