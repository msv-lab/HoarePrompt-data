Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
- `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`.

Let's break down the components:

1. **`t > 0`**: This tells us that `t` is a positive integer.
2. **`n` is an input integer**: This means `n` is provided as input to the program.
3. **`a` is a sorted list of integers**: This implies that `a` is a list of integers arranged in non-decreasing order.
4. **`p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1`**: 
   - If `n` is odd, then `(n + 1) // 2` gives the middle index of the list `a` plus one.
   - Subtracting 1 from this result gives the middle index of the list `a`.
   - If `n` is even, then `(n + 1) // 2` is equivalent to `n // 2 + 1`, which is the index just after the middle of the list `a`.
5. **`res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`**: 
   - `res` will be the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.

Since the exact value of `n` and the contents of `a` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `res`. However, we know that `res` is the count of occurrences of the middle element (or the element just after the middle if `n` is even) in the sorted list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be a count of how many times the middle element (or the element just after the middle if `n` is even) appears in the list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`)**
