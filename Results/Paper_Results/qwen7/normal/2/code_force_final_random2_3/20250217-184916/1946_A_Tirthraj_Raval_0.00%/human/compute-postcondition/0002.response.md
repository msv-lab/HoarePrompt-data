Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider Additional Context**: The context mentions that `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. However, these details about `n` and `a` are not directly relevant to the loop condition itself.

5. **Formulate the Final State**: Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
