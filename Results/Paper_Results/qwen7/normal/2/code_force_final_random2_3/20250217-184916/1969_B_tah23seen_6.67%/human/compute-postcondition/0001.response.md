Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in sChar:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `sChar`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `s` is an empty list (though this variable is not used in the loop head).
   - `sChar` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each character in `sChar`. For the loop to execute, `sChar` must contain at least one character.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop will iterate over each character in `sChar`, `sChar` must have at least one character for the loop to execute. The value of `i` will be set to each character in `sChar` during each iteration, but we don't need to specify its initial value since it will change during the loop.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `sChar` to ensure it contains at least one character.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 1**
