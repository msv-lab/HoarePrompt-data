To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the states of the variables involved in the loop condition: `left` and `s[left]`.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `left` is 1.
   - `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `cost` is `right - left + 1`.
   - `right` is equal to the length of `s`.
   - The length of `s` must be at least 2.
   - No character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0'.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop continues to increment `right` as long as `right` is less than the length of `s` and the character at position `right` is not '0'.
   - After the loop completes all its iterations, `right` will be equal to the length of `s`, meaning it has traversed the entire string without encountering a '0' character in the process.

3. **First Iteration Requirement**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `left` must be less than the length of `s` and `s[left]` must not be '1'.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that `left` is less than the length of `s` and `s[left]` is not '1'. Since `left` is initially 1 and `s` has a minimum length of 2, `left` will always be less than the length of `s`. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `s[left]` is not '1'.

Since `left` is 1, we need to ensure that `s[1]` is not '1'. 

Thus, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `s[1]` is not '1'.

State: **`left` is 1, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - left + 1`, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and the length of `s` must be at least 2, and `s[1]` must not be '1' and no character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0'.**
