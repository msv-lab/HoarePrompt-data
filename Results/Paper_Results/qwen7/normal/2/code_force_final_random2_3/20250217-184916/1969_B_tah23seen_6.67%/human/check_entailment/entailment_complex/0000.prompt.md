Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: s is a list containing all the integer values of each character in sChar, and i is the last character in sChar.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is 11, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is 11, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.
    #
    #Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop continues to increment `left` until it reaches the end of the string `s` or encounters a '1'. Given that `left` is 11 after the third iteration and the loop condition `left < len(s)` must hold, `left` will continue to increment until it reaches the length of `s`. This means `left` will be equal to the length of `s`, making `right` also equal to the length of `s` since the loop terminates when `left` equals `right`. 
    #
    #Since the loop increments `cost` by `right - left + 1` each time it swaps elements, and `right` is now equal to `len(s)`, the final value of `cost` will be `len(s) - 11 + 1 = len(s) - 10`. Given that `left` is 11, the length of `s` must be at least 11 for the loop to have completed its iterations. Therefore, `cost` will be `11` if the length of `s` is exactly 11, and it will increase accordingly if the length of `s` is greater than 11. The other variables remain unchanged from their final state after the third iteration.
    return cost
    #The program returns a cost value which is 11 if the length of `s` is exactly 11, and increases by 1 for each additional character beyond 11 in the length of `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string `sChar` and converts it into a list of integers. It then iterates through the list, swapping '1's and '0's to move all '0's to the left side and all '1's to the right side. The function calculates the total cost, which is the sum of the sizes of the subarrays that need to be swapped to achieve the desired order. The cost is determined by the number of characters in the string `sChar`. If the length of `sChar` is exactly 11, the function returns 11; otherwise, it returns 11 plus the number of additional characters beyond 11.
