Output State: **`left` is 1, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is 0, `right` is 0, and the length of `s` must be at least 2, the value of `s[right]` is 1, and the value of `s[left]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code swaps the values of `s[right]` and `s[left]`. Initially, `s[left]` is 1 and `s[right]` is 0. After the swap, `s[left]` becomes 0 and `s[right]` becomes 1. All other variables (`left`, `s`, `i`, `cost`, `right`) remain unchanged except for the values they hold.
