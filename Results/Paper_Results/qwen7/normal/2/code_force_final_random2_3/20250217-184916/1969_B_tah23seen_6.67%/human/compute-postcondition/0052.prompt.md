Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `left` is 5, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - 4`, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, the length of `s` must be at least 2, `s[1]` must not be '1', `s[4]` must not be '1', no character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0', and `s[right]` must be '0'.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `right` is less than the length of `s` and `s[right]` is not '0'. After executing the loop multiple times, `right` will eventually reach the end of the list `s` (i.e., `right` equals the length of `s`), and since the condition `s[right]` is not checked anymore (as the loop terminates when `right` equals the length of `s`), `s[right]` must be '0' at this point. All other conditions remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    left += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is 6, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - 4`, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, the length of `s` must be at least 2, `s[1]` must not be '1', `s[4]` must not be '1', no character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0', `s[right]` must be '0', and `s[5]` must not be '1'
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `left` is 8, `s[6]` is not '1'
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `left` is 9, `s[6]` is not '1', and `len(s)` must be greater than 8


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
