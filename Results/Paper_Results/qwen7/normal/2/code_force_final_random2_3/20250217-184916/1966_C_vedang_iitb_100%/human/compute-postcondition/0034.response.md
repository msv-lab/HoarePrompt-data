Output State: **`tc` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `maxsize` is the maximum value in list `a`, and `mexsize` is 5.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`tc`, `t`, `n`, and `mexsize`) remain unchanged. The `maxsize` variable is still the maximum value in the list `a` after sorting, but since the exact values of `a` are not specified, it remains as the maximum value in the sorted list `a`.
