Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for sz in a:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 0
   - `t` is an input integer
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers with the first element removed
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the updated list `a`
   - `mexsize` is 3

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `sz` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` will have one less element than it did at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `maxsize` remains the same unless the new element `sz` is larger than the current `maxsize`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `tc` remains 0 because the postcondition does not mention updating `tc`.
   - `t` remains the same input integer.
   - `n` remains the same input integer.
   - `a` loses its first element (the one just processed), so it now has one less element.
   - `maxsize` remains the same unless the new element `sz` is larger than the current `maxsize`.
   - `mexsize` remains 3.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`tc` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with the first element removed and one less element than before, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the updated list `a`, and `mexsize` is 3**.
