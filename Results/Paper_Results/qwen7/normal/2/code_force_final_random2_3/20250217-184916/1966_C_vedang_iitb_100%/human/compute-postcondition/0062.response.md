Output State: **`tc` is the previous value of `tc` + 1, `t` is the same as before, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 1.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `mexsize`. None of the other variables (`tc`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
