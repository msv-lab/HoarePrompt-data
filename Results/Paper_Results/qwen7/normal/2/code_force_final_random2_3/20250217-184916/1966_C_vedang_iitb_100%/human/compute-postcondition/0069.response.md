Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `sz` is the first element of the list `a`.
- `a` is a non-empty list of sorted integers.
- The condition `sz == mexsize` (where `mexsize` is `sz + 1`) either holds true or does not change from the precondition.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each element in the list `a` using the variable `sz`.

### Analysis
1. **List `a`:**
   - Since `sz` is the first element of the list `a`, and the loop iterates over each element of `a`, the list `a` itself does not change within the loop. Therefore, the state of `a` remains the same as it was at the start of the current iteration.
   
2. **Variable `sz`:**
   - In the first iteration, `sz` is the first element of `a`.
   - After the first iteration, `sz` takes the value of the second element of `a` (since the loop moves to the next element).
   - For the loop to continue, `sz` should be the next element in the list `a`.

### Adjusting the States
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- `sz` will now be the second element of the list `a`.

### Updated State
- `sz` is the second element of the list `a`.
- `a` is still a non-empty list of sorted integers.

### Final Answer
State: **`sz` is the second element of the list `a`, and `a` is a non-empty list of sorted integers.**
