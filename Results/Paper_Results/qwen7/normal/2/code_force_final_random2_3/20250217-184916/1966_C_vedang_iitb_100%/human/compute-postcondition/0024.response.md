Based on the initial state provided:

- `tc` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is an input integer (its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer (its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with all elements removed, so it is an empty list.
- `maxsize` is 0 (since the list `a` is now empty).
- `mexsize` is 5.

The print statement checks if `mexsize` is even or odd and prints either "Alice" or "Bob" accordingly.

Since `mexsize` is 5, which is an odd number, the condition `mexsize % 2 == 0` evaluates to `False`.

Therefore, the print statement will output "Bob".

Output: **Bob**
