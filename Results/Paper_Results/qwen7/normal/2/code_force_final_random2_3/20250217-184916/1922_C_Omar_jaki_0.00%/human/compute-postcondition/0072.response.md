Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least 5 elements, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()`, `b` is a list where the last two elements are the result of cumulative additions and comparisons as described, `u` is a truthy value decreased by 1. If the current value of `c` is less than the current value of `d`, the last two elements of `b` are the result of certain cumulative additions and comparisons. Otherwise, `u` is a falsy value.
