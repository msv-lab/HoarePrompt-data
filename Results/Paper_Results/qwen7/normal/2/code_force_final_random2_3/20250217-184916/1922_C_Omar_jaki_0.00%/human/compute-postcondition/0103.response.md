To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process step by step based on the given initial state:

1. **List `a`**: It contains at least 6 elements. Let's denote the elements of `a` as `a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3], a[4], a[5], ...`.

2. **Variable `u`**: It is a falsy value. This means it could be `None`, `False`, `0`, `''`, etc.

3. **Variables `c` and `d`**: These are the return values from the function `r()`. Since no specific values are provided, we'll keep them as `c` and `d`.

4. **List `b`**: Initially, `b` is a list where each element is updated based on the conditions within the loop. The loop iterates over the elements of `a` starting from the second element (`a[1]`) to the end. For each element `v` (calculated as `y - x`), where `x` and `y` are consecutive elements from `a`, and `z` is the next element after `y`, the following conditions are checked:
   - If `v > x - w`, then `b` is updated by adding `b[-2] + v` to the current last element of `b`.
   - If `v > z - y`, then `b` is updated by adding `b[-1] + v` to the current last element of `b`.

Since the exact values of `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact values of `b`. However, we can describe the structure of `b` based on the conditions.

Given the conditions, the list `b` will start with its initial values (which are not specified but assumed to be unchanged until the loop starts updating them). As the loop iterates, the last element of `b` will be updated based on the conditions mentioned.

The print statement is:
```python
print(b, 'B')
```

This will print the list `b` followed by the string `'B'`.

Output: **[initial values of b, updated based on conditions described] B**
