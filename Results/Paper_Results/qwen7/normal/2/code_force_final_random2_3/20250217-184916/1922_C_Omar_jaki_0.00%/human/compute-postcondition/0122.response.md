Output State: **`u` is a falsy value, `c` is the return value from function `r()`, and `d` is the return value from function `r()`**

Explanation: Initially, `u` is a truthy value. After executing `u -= 1`, `u` is decremented by 1. Since `u` was initially truthy (non-zero), decrementing it by 1 will make it falsy (zero). The values of `c` and `d` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
