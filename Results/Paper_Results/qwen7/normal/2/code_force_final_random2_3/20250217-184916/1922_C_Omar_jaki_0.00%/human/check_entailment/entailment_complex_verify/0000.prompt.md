You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: Output State: `u` is a falsy value (0), `a` is a list with at least 7 elements, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()` after the loop has finished executing, `b` is a list where the last two elements are the cumulative results of the additions and comparisons performed within the loop for all iterations.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `u` will be a falsity value (0) because the loop condition `u` is no longer true. The list `a` will have at least 7 elements due to the updates made within the loop. The variables `c` and `d` will hold the most recent values returned by the function `r()` after the loop has finished executing. The list `b` will remain unchanged from its final state after the last iteration of the loop, with the last two elements being the cumulative results of the additions and comparisons performed during all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `a` and handles multiple queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the difference between specific elements in the list `a`. Initially, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the list `a`, performs some calculations, and handles the queries. Finally, it outputs the differences for each query based on the calculated values stored in the list `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issue.

1. The program reads input but does not process it according to the problem description.
2. The variable `a` is constructed with additional boundary values (`-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0`), which do not seem to serve any purpose in the context of finding the closest city.
3. The variables `b` are initialized incorrectly and updated in a manner that does not reflect the logic required to solve the problem.
4. The logic for calculating the minimum number of coins to travel between two cities is not implemented correctly.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- Cities are located at points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`.
- Queries are: `(1, 4)`, `(1, 5)`, `(3, 4)`, `(3, 2)`, `(5, 1)`.

The expected outputs are `3`, `8`, `1`, `4`, `14`.

However, the provided code does not correctly compute these results. For instance, for the query `(1, 4)`, the expected output is `3` (as explained in the problem statement), but the code does not produce this result due to its incorrect implementation.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
