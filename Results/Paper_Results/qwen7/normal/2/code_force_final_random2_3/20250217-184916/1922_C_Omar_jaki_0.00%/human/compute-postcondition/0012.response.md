Output State: **`b` is a list with two elements where the first element is `b[-2] + 0` and the second element is `b[-1] + 0`, `x` is `w`, `y` is `x`, `z` is `y`, `v` is `0`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `v` is `y - x`, `x` is `w`, `y` is `x`, `z` is `y`, and `v` is `x - x` which equals `0`.
- The code updates `b` by adding `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)` and `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`.
- Since `v` is `0`, `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` both evaluate to `False` (since `0` is not greater than any number).
- Therefore, `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)` simplifies to `b[-2] + 0` and `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)` simplifies to `b[-1] + 0`.
- Hence, `b` gets updated to include these new values, while the other variables remain unchanged.
