Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list with at least 5 elements, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()`, `2000000000.0`, `b` is a list where the last two elements are the result of the cumulative additions and comparisons as described, `u` is the return value from function `r()`
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least 5 elements, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()`, `b` is a list where the last two elements are the result of cumulative additions and comparisons as described, `u` is a truthy value decreased by 1. If the current value of `c` is less than the current value of `d`, the last two elements of `b` are the result of certain cumulative additions and comparisons. Otherwise, `u` is a falsy value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a list with at least 5 elements, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()`, `b` is a list where the last two elements are the result of cumulative additions and comparisons as described, `u` is a falsy value. Since both the if and else parts do not change the state of the variables, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `u` is a truthy value - 1, `a` is a list with at least 5 elements, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()`. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of `u`, `a`, `c`, and `d`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
