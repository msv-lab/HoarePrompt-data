Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `r` is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces, `t` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `t, = r()` assigns the first integer from the input split by spaces to the variable `t`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
