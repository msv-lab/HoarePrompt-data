Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least 6 elements, `u` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` remains the return value from function `r()` which is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is the return value from function `r()` and is greater than or equal to `d`.
