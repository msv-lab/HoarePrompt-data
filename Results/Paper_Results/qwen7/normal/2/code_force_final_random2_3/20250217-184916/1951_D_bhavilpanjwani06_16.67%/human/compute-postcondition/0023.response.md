Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes integers t, n, and k. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, it processes these values but does not specify a direct return type or value.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over multiple test cases, each containing t, n, and k, and performs some operation based on these values. However, without further details on the operation or return value, the exact functionality cannot be fully described beyond these parameters and their constraints.
