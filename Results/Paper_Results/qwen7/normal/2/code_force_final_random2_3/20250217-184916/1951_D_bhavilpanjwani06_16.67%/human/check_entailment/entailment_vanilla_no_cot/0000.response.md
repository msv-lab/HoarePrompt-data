Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for all test cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. The program does not consider the scenario where more than two stalls might be needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
2. The logic for determining the number of stalls and their respective prices is incomplete and does not cover all possible cases.

Here is an example where the provided program fails:

### Example Test Case:
```
3
7 3
6 4
255 8
```

### Expected Output:
```
YES
10
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
NO
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```

### Actual Output from Provided Program:
```
YES
2
6 1
NO
NO
```

The provided program incorrectly outputs "NO" for the third test case because it does not properly distribute the prices across the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly 8 jewels. The program only considers scenarios with up to two stalls, which is insufficient for handling all cases as described in the problem.
