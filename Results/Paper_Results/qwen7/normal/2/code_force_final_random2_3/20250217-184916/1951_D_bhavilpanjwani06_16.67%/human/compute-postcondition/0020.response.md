Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to `k`, and `a` is a list of integers. If `n` equals `k`, then `n` remains unchanged and the condition holds as is. Otherwise, if `(k - 1) < (n - k + 1)`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, the condition `(k - 1) ≥ (n - k + 1)` holds.
