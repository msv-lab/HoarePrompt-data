Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), a list \( l \) of \( n \) positive integers, and \( m \) queries. It calculates the cumulative sums of the list \( l \) and then for each query, it determines if the sum of any subarray within the specified range meets a specific condition. If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.**
