Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` remains 0, `p` remains an empty list, `m` is greater than 0, `l` remains a non-empty list, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`, `a` and `b` are updated to the integers inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from its current value, which was previously `p[b - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
