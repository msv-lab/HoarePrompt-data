Output State: **`c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `c`, `p`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. The input integers `a` and `b` are stored in `a` and `b`, respectively.
