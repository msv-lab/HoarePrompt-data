Output State: **`c` is 0, `p` is an empty list, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a non-empty list, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `c`, `p`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
