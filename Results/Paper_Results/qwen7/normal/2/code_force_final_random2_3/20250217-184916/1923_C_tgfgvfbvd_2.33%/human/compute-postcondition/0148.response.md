Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `c` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`, and `p` will be a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. The variable `m` will hold the total number of queries processed across all test cases. For each query, the variable `s` will be calculated as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if applicable, and based on the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))`, either 'YES' or 'NO' will be printed for that specific query.
