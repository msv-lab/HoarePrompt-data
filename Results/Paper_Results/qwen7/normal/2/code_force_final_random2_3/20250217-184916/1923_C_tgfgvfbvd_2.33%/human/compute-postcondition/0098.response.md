Output State: **`c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the last input integers provided during the loop's execution, `m` is `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` with the final adjustments made during each iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The values of `c`, `p`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `m` is incremented by 1 due to the addition operation. The values of `n` and `c` are now dependent on the input, but since the exact input values are not specified, they are left as placeholders. The cumulative sum list `p` and the other variables remain unaffected.
