Output State: **`c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `c` will hold the total sum of all elements in the list `l`. The list `p` will contain each cumulative sum of the elements as the loop progresses through each element in `l`. Specifically, `p[0]` will be the sum of the first element, `p[1]` will be the sum of the first two elements, and so on, until `p[-1]` which will be the sum of all elements in `l`.
