Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first integer from the input split, `m` is the second integer from the input split, `l` is updated to a list of integers from the input split, `p` is an empty list, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop, `a` and `b` are the integers from the next input split, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`**

Explanation: The code `p = []` initializes `p` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `c`, `x`, `a`, `b`, or `s`. Therefore, their previous values remain unchanged. After executing this line, `p` becomes an empty list.
