Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in l:`. The variables involved in this loop head are `x` and `l`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - **Variable `x`**: This variable takes each element from the list `l` in each iteration.
   - **List `l`**: This list must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is increased by `x_next` + `x`.
   - `l` must have at least one element.
   - `p` is a list containing the value of `c` + [c].

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must still have at least one element (since the loop condition is based on the presence of elements in `l`).
   - The variable `x` will take the next element from `l` in the next iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - Since `x` will take the next element from `l`, and `l` must still have at least one element, we need to ensure that `l` has at least two elements for the next iteration.
   - `c` will be updated based on the new value of `x` in the next iteration, but we don't know the exact value yet.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `l` must have at least two elements, and `x` will be the next element from `l`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`c` is increased by `x_next` + `x`, `l` must have at least two elements, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` + [c]**.
