Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in `l` minus the cumulative sum of the first `a-2` elements in `l`.
- The condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))` is true.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
