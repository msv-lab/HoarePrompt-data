Output State: **`c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in `l` minus the cumulative sum of the first `a-2` elements in `l`.**

Explanation: The code `s -= p[a - 2]` subtracts the value of `p[a - 2]` from `s`. Here, `p[a - 2]` is the cumulative sum of the first `a-2` elements in the list `l`. Since `a` is an input integer and initially greater than or equal to 2, `a - 2` is a valid index for the list `p`. The other variables remain unchanged.
