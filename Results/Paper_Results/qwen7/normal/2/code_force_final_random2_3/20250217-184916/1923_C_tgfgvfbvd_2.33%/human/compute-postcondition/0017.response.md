Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as there were iterations, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and splits them. These values are then assigned to `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
