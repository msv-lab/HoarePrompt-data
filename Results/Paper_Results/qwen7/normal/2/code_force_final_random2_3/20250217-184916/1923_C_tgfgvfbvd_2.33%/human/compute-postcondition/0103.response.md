Output State: **`c` is increased by `x`, `l` must have at least one element**

The code `c += x` increments the value of `c` by the value of `x`. The precondition that `l` must have at least one element remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `c` has been increased by `x`, and `l` still must have at least one element.
