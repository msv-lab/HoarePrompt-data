Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 2.
   - `max` is set to the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[1]`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`, the loop will continue if `i < n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must increment to 3 (since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 3 because `i` starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Post-Loop Body State**:
   - The value of `max` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since no such information is provided, we assume `max` stays the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `max` is set to the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[1]`, `n` must be greater than 3**
