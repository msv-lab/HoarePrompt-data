You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        max = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
                max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
        
        print(max)
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `max` contains the maximum value of the minimums between all consecutive elements in the list `a` for each of the `t` test cases, `t` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from input for each test case.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `max` will hold the highest value among all the minimum pairs of consecutive elements across all lists `a` provided by the input. The variable `t` will still be positive as it represents the number of test cases, and `a` will be the list of integers corresponding to each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each test case, it checks if the sum of n is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and if each a_i is within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. It then returns a result based on these conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
