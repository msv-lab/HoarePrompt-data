Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` should start at 1 (as specified in the range function).
   - `n` must be an integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

3. **Consider the given state before the loop**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `max` is 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop requires `n` to be greater than 0, we need to ensure this condition is met.
   - The variable `i` should be set to 1 as per the range function.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
