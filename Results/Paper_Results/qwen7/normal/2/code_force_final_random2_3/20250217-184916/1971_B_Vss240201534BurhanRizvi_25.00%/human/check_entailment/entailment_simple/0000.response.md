Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by generating a random permutation of the input string `s` and checking if it is different from `s`. If a different permutation is found, it prints "YES" followed by the permutation. Otherwise, it prints "NO". 

Given the constraints (where the length of `s` is at most 10), the program should work correctly for all valid inputs. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Random Permutation Generation**: The `random.sample(s, len(s))` function generates a random permutation of the string `s`.
2. **Check for Difference**: The condition `if s != s2:` ensures that the generated permutation is different from the original string.
3. **Output Handling**: The program handles both cases correctly by printing "YES" and the permutation or "NO" when no such permutation exists.

Since the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and the constraints are within the manageable range for random sampling, the program should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
