Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
    if s != s2:
        print('Yes')
        print(s2)
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s2` is a random permutation of the string `s`. If `s` is different from `s2`, the condition holds true. If `s` is equal to `s2`, the condition also holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is the input value from the user; `s2` is a random permutation of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the input value from the user; `s2` is a random permutation of `s`; `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and is decremented by 1 from the previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
