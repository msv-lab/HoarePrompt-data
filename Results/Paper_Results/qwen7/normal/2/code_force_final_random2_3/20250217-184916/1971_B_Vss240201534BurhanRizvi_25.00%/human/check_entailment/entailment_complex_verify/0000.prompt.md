You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning the input integer `n` (which was initially provided by `int(input())`) has been decremented to 0. For each iteration, `s` is the input string, and `s2` is a random permutation of `s`. If `s` is different from `s2`, 'Yes' is printed along with `s2`; otherwise, 'No' is printed. The final state includes the initial input integer `n` being 0, and for each of the input strings `s`, there is a corresponding random permutation `s2` printed as per the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it generates a random permutation of the string `s` and checks if the original string `s` is different from the permutation. If they are different, it prints 'Yes' followed by the permutation; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program uses random sampling to generate a new string `s2` that is a rearrangement of the input string `s`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the generated string `s2` will always be different from the original string `s`. In some cases, especially with small strings, the random sampling might result in the same string being generated, leading to an incorrect output of "Yes" followed by the same string `s`.

For example, consider the input string "aaa":
- The program might randomly sample the string and generate "aaa" again, resulting in the output:
  ```
  Yes
  aaa
  ```

This output is incorrect because the generated string `s2` should be different from `s`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement for every potential case, making it incorrect.
