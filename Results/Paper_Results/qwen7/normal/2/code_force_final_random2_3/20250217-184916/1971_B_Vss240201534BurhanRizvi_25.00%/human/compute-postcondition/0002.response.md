Output State: **`s2` is a random permutation of the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))` generates a random permutation of the string `s` and assigns it to `s2`. The original string `s` remains unchanged. The output state reflects that `s2` now holds a randomly shuffled version of the characters from `s`, while `s` retains its original value.
