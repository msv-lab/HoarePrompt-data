You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it generates a random permutation of the string `s` and checks if the original string `s` is different from the permutation. If they are different, it prints 'Yes' followed by the permutation; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the string `s`.
2. **Shuffling the String**: For each string `s`, the program shuffles the characters using `random.sample(s, len(s))`. This function returns a shuffled version of the string.
3. **Checking for Non-Equality**: The program checks if the shuffled string `s2` is different from the original string `s`.
4. **Output**: If `s2` is different from `s`, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`. Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Reasoning:

- **Shuffling**: The use of `random.sample` ensures that the characters are shuffled randomly, which means we have a good chance of getting a different string unless the original string has very limited permutations.
- **Non-Equality Check**: The check `if s != s2:` ensures that the shuffled string is not the same as the original string.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the string `s` consists of all unique characters, there will always be many different permutations, so it's easy to find a non-equal string.
  - If the string `s` has repeated characters, like "aaaaa", the shuffled version might still be "aaaaa". However, the problem guarantees that if such a string exists, it should be reported as "NO".
  - For strings with fewer than 10 characters, the number of permutations is manageable, and the random shuffle is likely to produce a different string.

### Edge Case Analysis:

- **String with All Unique Characters**: E.g., "abc". Shuffling will almost always produce a different string.
- **String with Repeated Characters**: E.g., "aaaaa". The probability of getting the same string after shuffling is low but not zero. However, the problem states that if no such string exists, it should report "NO".
- **String with Fewer Than 10 Characters**: The number of permutations is manageable, and the random shuffle is likely to produce a different string.

Given these points, the program handles the problem correctly and produces the expected results for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
