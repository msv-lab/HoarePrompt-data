Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is the input value from the user.
- `s2` is a random permutation of `s`.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and is decremented by 1 from the previous value.

The `print(s2)` statement will print the random permutation of the string `s`.

Output: **a random permutation of s**
