Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `a`.

2. **Determine the state changes inside the loop**: From the given information, we know that:
   - `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary.
   - `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations.
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
   - `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_y` retain their original values.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since the loop is iterating over `num` in `a`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `num`. After each iteration, `num` will take the next value from the list `a`. Therefore, `num` will be incremented to the next element in the list `a`.

4. **Maintain other states**: The other states such as `beautiful_count`, `case`, `results`, `freq`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged for the next iteration because they are not directly affected by the loop head.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `num` while keeping the other states the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary; `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`; `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1; `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_y` retain their original values; `num` is the next element in the list `a`**.
