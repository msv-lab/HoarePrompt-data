Output State: **`case` is now `case['params']` (which includes `n`, `x`, and `y`), `n`, `x`, and `y` are specific integers from `case['params']`, `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations, `freq` is a dictionary containing counts for all unique pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` seen throughout the iterations of the loop, `a` is an empty list, and `test_cases` still contains at least one element.**

This means that the `case` variable now holds the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from `case['params']`, and the other variables remain unchanged except for the update in the content of the `case` variable.
