Based on the initial state provided:

- `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
- `mod_x` is calculated as `(x - (num % x)) % x`.
- `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
- `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.
- `freq[(x - (num % x)) % x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
- `required_mod_y` is set to `mod_y`.

The print statement will output the following:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]** 

Here, `[num]` is the next element in the list `a`, `[mod_x]` is the result of `(x - (num % x)) % x`, `[mod_y]` is the result of `num % y`, and `[required_mod_x]` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it remains as a placeholder without a specific value.
