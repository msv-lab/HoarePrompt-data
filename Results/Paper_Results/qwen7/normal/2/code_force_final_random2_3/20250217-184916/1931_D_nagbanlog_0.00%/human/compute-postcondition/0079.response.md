To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
   - `mod_x` is updated to `(x - num % x) % x`.
   - `mod_y` retains its original value.
   - `required_mod_y` is now equal to `mod_y`.
   - `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code prints a formatted string with the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`.

Given the initial state, we need to understand the values of these variables:

- `num`: This is the number being processed in the loop.
- `mod_x`: It is updated to `(x - num % x) % x`.
- `mod_y`: It retains its original value after the loop.
- `required_mod_x`: It is set to `mod_x` at some point.
- `required_mod_y`: It is set to `mod_y` at some point.

Since the exact values of `num`, `x`, `y`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are not explicitly provided, we can only describe them in terms of their definitions.

Therefore, the output will be a formatted string with placeholders for these variables.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y]**
