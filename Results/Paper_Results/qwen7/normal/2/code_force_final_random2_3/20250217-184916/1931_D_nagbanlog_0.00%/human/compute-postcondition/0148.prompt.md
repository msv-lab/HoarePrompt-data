Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `beautiful_count` is 0, `case` is the next dictionary in `test_cases` containing `params`, `results`, `beautiful_count`, etc.; `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, and `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`; `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`; `freq` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    print(
        f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
        )
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`; otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is the next element in the list `a`; `mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `required_mod_y` is `num % y`; `beautiful_count` is increased by 1 if `(mod_x, mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `freq[(x - (num % x)) % x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
