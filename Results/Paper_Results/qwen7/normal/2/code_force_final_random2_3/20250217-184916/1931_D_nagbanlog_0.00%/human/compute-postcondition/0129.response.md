Output State: **`beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `freq` remains unchanged, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The line of code `beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` increases the value of `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The other variables (`mod_x`, `num`, `freq`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
