Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `case['params']` retains its original value, `results` retains its original value, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` retains its original value, and `required_mod_y` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_x` as `num % x`. This value is stored in `mod_x`. Depending on whether the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the `freq` dictionary, `beautiful_count` is either incremented by the corresponding value in `freq` or remains unchanged. The other variables retain their original values.
