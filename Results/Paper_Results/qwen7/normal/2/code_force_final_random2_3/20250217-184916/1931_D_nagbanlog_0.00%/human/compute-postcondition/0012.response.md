Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is not empty (though the value of `a` itself is not relevant to the print statement).
- `mod_x` is `num % x`.
- `mod_y` is `num % y`.
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `num` is the number whose modulus with `x` and `y` is being calculated.
- `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a formatted string with the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x` (which is the same as `mod_x`), and `required_mod_y` (which is the same as `mod_y`).

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [num % x], mod_y: [num % y], required_mod_x: [num % x], required_mod_y: [num % y]**
