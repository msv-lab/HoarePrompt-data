Output State: **`case` is the next dictionary in `test_cases` containing `params`, `results`, `beautiful_count`, etc.; `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, and `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`.**

This means that the dictionary `case` remains unchanged except for the assignment of `n`, `x`, and `y` to the first, second, and third elements of the `params` list within the `case` dictionary, respectively.
