Based on the initial state provided:

- `beautiful_count` contains the total count of numbers from `a` that satisfy the condition `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` existing in `freq`.
- `case['params']` remains as a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`.
- `results` is a list that accumulates the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all unique `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pairs encountered during the loop iterations.
- `freq` is a dictionary that keeps track of the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
- `a` is the array from which numbers are iterated over.
- `test_cases` remains unchanged.

The `print` statement outputs the value of `beautiful_count`.

Since the exact value of `beautiful_count` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its precise numerical value. However, we know it represents the count of numbers from `a` that meet the specified condition.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: beautiful_count (where beautiful_count is the count of numbers from `a` that satisfy the condition `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` existing in `freq`)**
