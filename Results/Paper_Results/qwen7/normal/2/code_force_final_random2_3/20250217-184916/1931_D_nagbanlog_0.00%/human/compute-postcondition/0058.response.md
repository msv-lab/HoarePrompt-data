Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`, `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `a` is updated to be `case['array']`, and `test_cases` still contains at least one element.**

Explanation: The line `beautiful_count = 0` initializes the variable `beautiful_count` to 0. None of the other variables (`case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `results`, `freq`, `a`, `test_cases`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
