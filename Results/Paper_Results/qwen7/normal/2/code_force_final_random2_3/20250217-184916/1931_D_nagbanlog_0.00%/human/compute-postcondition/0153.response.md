Output State: `results` is a list containing the total count of beautiful pairs for all test cases processed. For each test case, `beautiful_count` is calculated based on the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs in the `freq` dictionary. Specifically, `beautiful_count` accumulates the count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` that exist in `freq`. The `freq` dictionary tracks the occurrences of each unique `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair across all numbers in the arrays provided by the test cases. After all iterations of the loop, `results` will contain the final `beautiful_count` for each test case, representing the total number of beautiful pairs found across all test cases.
