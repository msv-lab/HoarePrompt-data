Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `case` is the next dictionary in `test_cases` containing `params`, `results`, `beautiful_count`, etc.; `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, and `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`; `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`; `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The line `beautiful_count = 0` initializes the variable `beautiful_count` to 0. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
