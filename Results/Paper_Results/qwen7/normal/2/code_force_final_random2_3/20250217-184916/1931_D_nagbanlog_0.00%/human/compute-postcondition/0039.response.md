Output State: **`a` is not empty, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1; `num` is the next element in the list `a`; `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`; `mod_y` is equal to `num % y` (now updated); `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y` (now updated); `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mod_y` to `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The updated values of `mod_y` and `required_mod_y` reflect the new value of `num % y`.
