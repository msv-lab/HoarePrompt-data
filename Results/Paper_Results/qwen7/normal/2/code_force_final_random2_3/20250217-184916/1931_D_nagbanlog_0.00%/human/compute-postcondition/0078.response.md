Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary; `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`; `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1; `mod_x` is updated to `(x - num % x) % x`; `mod_y` retains its original value; `required_mod_y` is now equal to `mod_y`; `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`.**

This means that the variable `required_mod_y` has been updated to the current value of `mod_y`, while `mod_x` and `mod_y` themselves have been updated according to their respective formulas. All other variables retain their previous values unless specified otherwise.
