Output State: **`a` is not empty, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1` increments the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1. The value of `a` and `beautiful_count` remain unchanged unless `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, in which case `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Since the initial conditions state that `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not necessarily in `freq`, `beautiful_count` may or may not be incremented, but `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is definitely incremented by 1.
