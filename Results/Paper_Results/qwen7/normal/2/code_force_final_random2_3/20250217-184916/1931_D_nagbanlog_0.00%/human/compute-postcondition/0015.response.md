Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `a` is not empty, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`**.

This means that the value of `beautiful_count` has been increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
