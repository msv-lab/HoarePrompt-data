Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`, `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`, `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x**.

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. However, since `mod_x` is defined as `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is effectively `(x - (num % x)) % x`. This calculation does not affect the values of the other variables, so they remain unchanged.
