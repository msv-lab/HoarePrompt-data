Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `case['params']` retains its original value, `results` retains its original value, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 1, and `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_y` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1. Since the initial postcondition specifies that `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary, and otherwise remains unchanged, the only change here is in `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` which is set to 1. All other variables retain their original values as per the initial postcondition.
