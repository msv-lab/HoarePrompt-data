Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case in test_cases is a list containing three integers n, x, and y such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= x, y <= 10^9; and each test case also includes a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for case in test_cases:
    n, x, y = case['params']
    a = case['array']
    freq = {}
    beautiful_count = 0
    print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
    for num in a:
        mod_x = num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
        required_mod_y = mod_y
        print(
            f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
            )
        if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
            beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
        if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
    print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
    results.append(beautiful_count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`, `beautiful_count` is the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations, `freq` is a dictionary containing counts for all unique pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` seen throughout the iterations of the loop, `a` is an empty list, and `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are no longer defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `beautiful_count` contains the total count of numbers from `a` that satisfy the condition `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` existing in `freq`; `case['params']` remains as a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`; `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count`; `freq` is a dictionary that keeps track of the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair; `a` is the array from which numbers are iterated over, and `test_cases` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` contains the value of `beautiful_count`, which is the total count of pairs \((mod_x, mod_y)\) found in the frequency dictionary `freq`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
