Postcondition: `num` is the next element in the list `a`; `mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`; `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `freq` remains unchanged; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `required_mod_y` is `num % y`.
