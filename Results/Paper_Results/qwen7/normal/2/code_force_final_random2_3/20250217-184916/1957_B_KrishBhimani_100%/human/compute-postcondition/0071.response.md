Output State: **`i` is the number of times `temp * 2` was less than `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`; `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is still equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing one element, which is `(1 << i) - 1`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code appends `(1 << i) - 1` to the list `ans`. Here, `(1 << i)` represents `2^i`, and subtracting 1 gives us a number with `i` bits set to 1 (e.g., if `i` is 3, then `(1 << 3) - 1` is `7`). Since `i` is the number of times the loop executed, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
