Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is now `temp * 2` (which was either 2 or 4), and `temp * 2` is now less than `k`.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` changes from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
