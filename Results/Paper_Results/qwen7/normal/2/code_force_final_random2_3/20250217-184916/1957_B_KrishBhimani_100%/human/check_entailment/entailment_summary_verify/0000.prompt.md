You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a list of integers \( ans \) based on the value of \( k \) and the length \( n \). If \( n = 1 \), the list contains only \( k \). Otherwise, the list starts with \((1 << i) - 1\) followed by \( k - (1 << i) - 1\), and is padded with zeros to reach a length of \( n \). The function prints the resulting list for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence results in a number with the maximum possible number of 1s in its binary representation. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input `n = 2` and `k = 3`. According to the problem description, the output should be a sequence of two non-negative integers that sum to 3 and maximize the number of 1s in their bitwise OR. The correct output would be `[1, 2]` because `1 | 2 = 3`, which has two 1s in its binary representation.

However, the provided program generates the sequence `[3, 0]` instead:
- It calculates `(1 << i) - 1` where `i` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`, which gives `3` for `k = 3`.
- It then appends `k - sum(ans)` which is `0` since `3 + 0 = 3`.

This sequence does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. Instead, the sequence `[1, 2]` should be used because `1 | 2 = 3` has more 1s in its binary representation compared to `3 | 0 = 3`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
