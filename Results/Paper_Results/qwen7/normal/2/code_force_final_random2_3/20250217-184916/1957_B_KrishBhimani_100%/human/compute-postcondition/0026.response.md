The `while True` loop will continue to execute as long as it is not explicitly broken out of. Given the condition inside the loop body (`temp * 2 < k`), we need to ensure that this condition is met for the loop to continue.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is such that either `temp * 2 < k` was true, or the loop was broken due to the condition not being met. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `temp * 2 < k` must be true.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `temp * 2 < k` holds true.

State: **`temp` is such that temp * 2 < k**
