Postcondition: `i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either `temp * 2` (if `temp * 2 < k` is true) or remains unchanged (if `temp * 2 < k` is false).
