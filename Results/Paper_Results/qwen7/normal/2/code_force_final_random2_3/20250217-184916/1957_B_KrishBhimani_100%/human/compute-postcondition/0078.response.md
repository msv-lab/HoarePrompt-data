Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` converts the first and second elements of the list `l1` into integers and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The other parts of `l1` remain unchanged.
