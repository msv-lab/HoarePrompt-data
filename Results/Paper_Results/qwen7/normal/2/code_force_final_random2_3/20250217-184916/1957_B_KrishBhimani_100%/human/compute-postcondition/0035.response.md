Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list containing two elements \((1 << i) - 1\) and `k - (1 << i) - 1`, and `temp` is such that `temp * 2 \>= k`**.

Explanation: The code appends `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains one element, which is \((1 << i) - 1\). Therefore, `sum(ans)` is \((1 << i) - 1\). So, `k - sum(ans)` becomes `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, which is appended to `ans`. Thus, `ans` now contains two elements: \((1 << i) - 1\) and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
