Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code `l1 = input().split()` reads an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to `l1`. It does not modify the existing values of `n` and `k`, which are derived from the first and second elements of `l1`, respectively. Therefore, the initial conditions remain valid, and the updated state includes the new assignment of `l1`.
