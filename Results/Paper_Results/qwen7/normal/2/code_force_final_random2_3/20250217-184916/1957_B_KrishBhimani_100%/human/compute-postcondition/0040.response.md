Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. This means the loop will iterate based on the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute again if the input value (let's call it `input_value`) is greater than 0.
   - We need to update the state of the variable that controls the loop, which is the number of iterations left.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`.
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `i` is a non-negative integer.
   - `ans` is a list containing three elements \([0, (1 << i) - 1, k - (1 << i) - 1]\).
   - `temp` is such that `temp * 2 \>= k` if `n` is not equal to 1. If `n` is 1, then `k` is either 1 or 0.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will take another input, so the current value of `input_value` will determine how many more times the loop will run.
   - After each iteration, the value of `input_value` decreases by 1 until it reaches 0.
   - Therefore, the new value of `input_value` will be the original value minus 1.

5. **New State**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the new state will depend on the input value after the current iteration.
   - Let's assume the original input value was `x`. After one iteration, the new input value will be `x - 1`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `l1` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `k` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `k0` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `arr` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `i` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `ans` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `temp` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.

The only thing that changes is the number of iterations left, which is determined by the input value.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list containing three elements \([0, (1 << i) - 1, k - (1 << i) - 1]\), and `temp` is such that `temp * 2 \>= k` if `n` is not equal to 1. If `n` is 1, then `k` is either 1 or 0. The loop will execute one more time if the input value is greater than 0.**
