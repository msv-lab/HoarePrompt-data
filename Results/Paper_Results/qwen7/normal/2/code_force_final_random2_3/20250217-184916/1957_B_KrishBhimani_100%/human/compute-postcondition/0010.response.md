Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes the list `ans` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the new condition that `ans` is now an empty list.
