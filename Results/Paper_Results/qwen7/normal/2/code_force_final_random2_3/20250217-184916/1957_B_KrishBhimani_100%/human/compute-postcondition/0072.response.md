Output State: **`i` is the number of times `temp * 2` was less than `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`; `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is still equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code appends `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains one element `(1 << i) - 1`. After appending `k - sum(ans)`, `ans` now contains two elements: `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, which simplifies to `k - (1 << i) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
