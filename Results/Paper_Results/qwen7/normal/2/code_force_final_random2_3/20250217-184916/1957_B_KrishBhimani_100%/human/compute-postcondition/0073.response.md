Output State: **`i` is the number of times `temp * 2` was less than `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`; `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is still equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)` followed by 0s to make its length equal to `n`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length matches `n`. Since `ans` initially contains two elements, `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, appending zeros to make its length equal to `n` means adding `n - 2` zeros to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
