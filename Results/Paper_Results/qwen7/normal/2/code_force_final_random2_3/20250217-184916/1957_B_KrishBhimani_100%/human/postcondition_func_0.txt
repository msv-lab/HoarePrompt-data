The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a list of integers \( ans \) based on the value of \( k \) and the length \( n \). If \( n = 1 \), the list contains only \( k \). Otherwise, the list starts with \((1 << i) - 1\) followed by \( k - (1 << i) - 1\), and is padded with zeros to reach a length of \( n \). The function prints the resulting list for each test case.
