Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `l1 = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace by default, and assigns this list to `l1`. Since the exact input is not specified, we can only describe `l1` as a list of strings resulting from the split operation. All other variables remain in their initial state, but since no other variables are mentioned, we only update `l1`.
