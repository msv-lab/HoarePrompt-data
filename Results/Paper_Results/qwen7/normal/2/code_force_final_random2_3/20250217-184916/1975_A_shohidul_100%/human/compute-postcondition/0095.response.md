Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `new` is an empty list, `check_all_new` is `True`, and `new_all` is `True`.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
