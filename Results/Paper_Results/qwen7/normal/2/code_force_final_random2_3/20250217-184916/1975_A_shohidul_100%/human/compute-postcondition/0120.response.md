Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is True if all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without referencing any variables or objects that need to be evaluated, the output is straightforward.

Output: **NO**
