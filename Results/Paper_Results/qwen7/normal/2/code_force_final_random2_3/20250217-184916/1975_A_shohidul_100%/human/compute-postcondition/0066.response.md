Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and in either case (whether the condition `check_all_new and new_all` is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
