Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive). This means `i` starts from 1 and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`.
   - `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`.
   - `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2.

5. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - The conditions for `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` remain the same because they are not directly modified by the loop itself; they depend on the values within the loop body, which we are not given.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order**.
