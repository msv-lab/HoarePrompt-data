Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `check_all_new` remains unchanged, `new_all` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to `n`, `new` is a slice from index `n` to the end of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` creates a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is equal to `n`) to the end of the list. The values of `t`, `n`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`, and `i` remain unchanged.
