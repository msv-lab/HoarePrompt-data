Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, and after executing the if-else block, if `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, the loop or if statement will break, with `check_all_new` and `new_all` being boolean values indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]` and if the elements in `new` from index 0 to len(new)-1 are in non-decreasing order, respectively. If the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is not met, the postcondition remains unchanged as there is no additional information provided in the else part.
