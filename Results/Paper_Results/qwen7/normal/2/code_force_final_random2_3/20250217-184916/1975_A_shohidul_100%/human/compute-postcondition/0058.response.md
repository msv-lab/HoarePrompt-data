Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.**

Explanation: The code calculates `new_all` which checks if all consecutive elements in the list `new` are in non-decreasing order. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the elements in `new`, `new_all` will be a boolean value based on the comparison of each pair of consecutive elements in `new`. The other variables remain unchanged.
