Output: **NO**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided:
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether not all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether not all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'. There are no conditions or calculations involved in this print statement, so it directly outputs the string as specified.
