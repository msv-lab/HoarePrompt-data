Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `check_all_new` is True indicating all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is True indicating the elements in `new` from index 0 to len(new)-1 are in non-decreasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
