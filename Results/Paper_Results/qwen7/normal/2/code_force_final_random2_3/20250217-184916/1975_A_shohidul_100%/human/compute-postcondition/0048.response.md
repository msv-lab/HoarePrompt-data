The only objects in the loop head are `_` (which is just a placeholder), `t`, and `n`. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, we only need to consider `t` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that `i` is now equal to `n`, and `t` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these conditions.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**
