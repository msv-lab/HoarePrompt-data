Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`
   - `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`
   - `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `2`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2.

6. **Other states remain unchanged**:
   - The list `new` remains the same.
   - The boolean values `check_all_new` and `new_all` remain the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order**.
