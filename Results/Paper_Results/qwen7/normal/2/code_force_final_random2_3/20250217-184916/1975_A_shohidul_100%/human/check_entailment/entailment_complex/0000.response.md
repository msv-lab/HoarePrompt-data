Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads the length `n` of the array and the array `a` itself for each test case.

2. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the array `a` is already non-decreasing using the `all` function with the condition `a[i-1] <= a[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`. If this condition holds true, it prints 'YES' immediately.

3. **Splitting and Checking**: If the initial check fails, the program iterates through the array to find a point where the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing. This is done by checking the conditions `a[0] >= new[i]` for the first part and `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for the second part after splitting at index `i`.

4. **Early Termination**: If a valid split is found, the program prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. If no valid split is found after checking all possible splits, the program prints 'NO'.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case as required.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the implementation matches the requirements and logic described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
