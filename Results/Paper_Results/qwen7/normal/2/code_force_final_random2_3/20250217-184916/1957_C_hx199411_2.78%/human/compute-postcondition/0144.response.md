Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be 0 because the loop continues while `t` is non-zero, decrementing `t` by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0. At this point, there will be no further iterations. The value of `n` will be the initial value minus the cumulative `num` from all iterations. The variable `k` will be the last value provided in the input for the final iteration of the loop. The variable `num` will be the total count accumulated over all iterations, representing the sum of 2 for each pair where `c` does not equal `r`, plus 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r`. The variable `m` will be `n - num`. Depending on the value of `m`, either `0`, `1`, or the computed value from the dynamic programming array `dp` will be printed. If `m` is 0, `0` will be printed. If `m` is 1, `1` will be printed. Otherwise, the value from `dp[m]` will be printed, computed using the recurrence relation \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
