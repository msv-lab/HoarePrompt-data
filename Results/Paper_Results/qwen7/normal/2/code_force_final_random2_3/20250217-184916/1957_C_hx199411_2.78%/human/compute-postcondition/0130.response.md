Output State: **`m` is `n - num`, `i` is `k`, `num` is the sum of increments based on the condition in the loop, and `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted during the final iteration of the loop, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. This list does not affect the values of `m`, `i`, `num`, `c`, and `r`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
