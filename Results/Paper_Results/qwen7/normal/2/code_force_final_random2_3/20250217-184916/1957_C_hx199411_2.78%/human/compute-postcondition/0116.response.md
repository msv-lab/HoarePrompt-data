Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is `num + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Since `num` was previously either `num + 1` if `c` equals `r`, or `num + 2` if `c` does not equal `r`, after executing the code, `num` will be one more than its previous value. All other variables (`i`, `k`, `c`, `r`) remain unchanged.
