Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted by the user during the loop's final iteration, `num` is the sum of 2 added for each pair of inputs where `c` does not equal `r`, plus 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r`, and `m` is calculated as `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `dp` with zeros, where the length of the list is `m + 1`. The values of `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
