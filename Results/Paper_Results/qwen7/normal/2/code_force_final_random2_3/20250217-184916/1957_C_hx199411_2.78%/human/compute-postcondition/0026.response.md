Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between 0 and 2*k, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `k-1`. The variable `num` will be the sum of increments based on the conditions inside the loop. Since the loop runs `k` times, `num` can take any value from 0 (if `c` always equals `r`) to 2*k (if `c` never equals `r`). The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body or head.
