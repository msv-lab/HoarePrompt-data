Reasoning:

1. The problem requires calculating the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, considering the constraints and the mirroring rule.
2. The provided code correctly handles the input and processes each test case:
   - It reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(n\) and \(k\), and the moves made.
   - It counts the number of diagonal moves (\(r_i = c_i\)) and non-diagonal moves separately.
   - It calculates the remaining number of valid positions (`m`), which is \(n - \text{num}\).
3. The logic for handling the remaining positions is correct:
   - If `m` is 0, there are no valid moves left, so it prints 0.
   - If `m` is 1, there is exactly one valid move left, so it prints 1.
   - Otherwise, it uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations for the remaining positions.
4. The dynamic programming approach is correct for calculating the number of configurations for the remaining positions:
   - The base cases and transitions are handled correctly.
   - The results are computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as required.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
