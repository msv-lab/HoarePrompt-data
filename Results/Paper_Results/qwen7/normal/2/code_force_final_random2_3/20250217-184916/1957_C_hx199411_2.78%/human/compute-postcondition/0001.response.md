Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is non-zero (i.e., `t != 0`).
3. **Current state before the loop**: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\). This means `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer within this range.

Given that `t` is already an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it is non-zero and thus the loop will definitely execute at least once.

Since the loop condition is met and no adjustments are needed to make the loop execute the first time, we do not need to modify any states.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**.

This is the same as the current state because the loop will definitely execute the first time given the constraints on `t`.
