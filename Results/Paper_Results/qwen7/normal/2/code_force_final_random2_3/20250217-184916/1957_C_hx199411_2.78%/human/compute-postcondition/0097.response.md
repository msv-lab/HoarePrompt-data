Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `i` equals `k`, `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted during the loop's final iteration, `num` is the sum of 2 added for each pair of inputs where `c` does not equal `r`, plus 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r`, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `t` is decreased by 1.**

In this case, the code `t -= 1` decreases the value of `t` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
