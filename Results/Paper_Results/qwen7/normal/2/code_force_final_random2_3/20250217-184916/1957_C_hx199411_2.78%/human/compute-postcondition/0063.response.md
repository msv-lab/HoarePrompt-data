Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an integer from the input split, `c` and `r` are both integers**.

Explanation: The code takes two inputs separated by a space and splits them into two integers, assigning them to `c` and `r`. The values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged. The initial state of `c` being an input integer and `r` being an input integer is preserved, and now they are explicitly stated to be integers after the split operation.
