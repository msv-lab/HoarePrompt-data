Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between 0 and 2*k, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is equal to 0, then no changes are made. If `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for `i` from 3 to `m`, `dp[i]` has been updated according to the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)`.**
