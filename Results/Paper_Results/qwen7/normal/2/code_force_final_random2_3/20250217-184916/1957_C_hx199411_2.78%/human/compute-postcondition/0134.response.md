Output State: **`dp[i]` is `(dp[k - 1] + (k - 1) * dp[k - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` where `k` is at least 3**, `i` is `k`.

This means that `dp[i]` (where `i` is `k`) is updated to the value of `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Given that `i` (or `k`) must be at least 3, the formula uses `dp[k - 1]` and `dp[k - 2]` to compute the new value of `dp[k]`. The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure it fits within standard integer limits.
