Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `c` is not equal to `r`; `num` is `num` + 2.**

The value of `num` is incremented by 2, while the values of `i`, `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged. The condition that `k` must be greater than 0 and `c` is not equal to `r` are still valid.
