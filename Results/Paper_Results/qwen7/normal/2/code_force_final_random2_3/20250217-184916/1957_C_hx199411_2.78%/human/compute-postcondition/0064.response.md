Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an integer from the input split, `c` and `r` are both integers**

Explanation: The variable `num` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Since the initial value of `num` was not specified, we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. However, we know that `num` has been incremented by 1. The other variables (`k`, `i`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is now 3 (since it was incremented from 2), while `k` must still be greater than 0, and `c` and `r` remain as input integers.
