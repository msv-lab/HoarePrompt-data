Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(3, m + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.
   - `m` is defined as `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to 1.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop starts from `3` and increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `5`.

4. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Given that `i` is now `5` and `m` is `n - num` (which is greater than or equal to 3), the loop will continue if `5 <= m`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `5`.
   - `m` remains unchanged unless there is additional logic affecting it within the loop body, but based on the given information, it stays as `n - num`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between 0 and 2*k, `i` is 5, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + (2 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)**
