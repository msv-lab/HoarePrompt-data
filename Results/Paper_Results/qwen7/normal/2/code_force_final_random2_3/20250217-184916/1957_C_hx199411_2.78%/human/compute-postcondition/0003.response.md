Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 0 and 10000-1.
