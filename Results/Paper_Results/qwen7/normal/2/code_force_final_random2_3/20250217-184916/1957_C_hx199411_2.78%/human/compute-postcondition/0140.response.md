Output State: The list `dp` will contain values from `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` such that each value `dp[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `m`) is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The initial conditions are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. The variable `i` starts at `k` and increases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `m`. After the loop completes, `dp[i]` will reflect the computed values up to `dp[m]` according to the given formula, and `m` will be the final upper limit of the range for which `dp[i]` has been computed.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, the `dp` list will have its values updated according to the provided formula for each index from 3 to `m`, starting with the initial values `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
