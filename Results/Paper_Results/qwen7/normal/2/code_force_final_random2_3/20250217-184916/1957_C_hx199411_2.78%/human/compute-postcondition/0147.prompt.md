You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The moves are represented as pairs of integers (r_i, c_i) for i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. No two rooks share the same row or column before each move, and the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        num = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        
        m = n - num
        
        if m == 0:
            print(0)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be 0 because the loop continues as long as `t` is non-zero, decrementing `t` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. At this point, no further iterations will occur. The values of `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `c`, and `r` will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. Specifically, `num` will be the cumulative sum of 2 for each pair where `c` does not equal `r`, plus 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r`. The variable `m` will be `n - num`. If `m` is 0, `m` will remain 0; if `m` is 1, `m` will remain 1; otherwise, `dp` will be a list of length `m + 1` where each element is computed using the recurrence relation \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)\), starting with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
    #
    #The final output will be determined by the value of `m`:
    #- If `m` is 0, the output will be `0`.
    #- If `m` is 1, the output will be `1`.
    #- Otherwise, the output will be the value of `dp[m]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by t pairs of integers (n, k) (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n). It also receives a list of k moves, each represented as a pair of integers (r_i, c_i) (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n). The function validates that no two rooks share the same row or column before each move and that all moves are valid. For each test case, it returns whether the given sequence of moves is valid based on the initial conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
