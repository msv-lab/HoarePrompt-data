Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the current value of `c` is equal to the current value of `r`; `num` is increased by 1.**

The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Since `num` was not previously defined, it is initialized to 1 (as it is the typical behavior when using `+= 1` without an initial value). The values of `i`, `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state.
