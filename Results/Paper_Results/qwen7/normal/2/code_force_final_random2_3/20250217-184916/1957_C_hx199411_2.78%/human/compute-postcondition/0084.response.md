Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `k`, `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted by the user during the loop's final iteration, `num` is the sum of 2 added for each pair of inputs where `c` does not equal `r`, plus 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r`, and `m` is calculated as `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` filled with zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3.**

The code `dp[2] = 3` updates the value of `dp[2]` to 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
