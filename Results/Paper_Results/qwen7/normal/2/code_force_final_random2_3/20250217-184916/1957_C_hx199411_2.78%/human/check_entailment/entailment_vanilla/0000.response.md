Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of coordinates `(r, c)` representing the positions of the rooks placed so far.

2. **Calculating the Number of Unaffected Positions:**
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of positions that are mirrored (i.e., `c == r`).
   - For each non-mirrored move, `num` is incremented by 2 because both a white and a black rook are placed.
   - This calculation ensures that the number of unique positions that are still available for rooks is `m = n - num`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `m` is 0, there are no positions left, so the program prints 0.
   - If `m` is 1, there is exactly one position left, so the program prints 1.

4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining positions.
   - The array `dp` is initialized to store the number of configurations for up to `m` positions.
   - The base cases are set: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For each subsequent value of `i` from 3 to `m`, the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations.
   - This formula accounts for the fact that each new position can either be empty or contain a rook, and the previous configurations are combined accordingly.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `dp[m]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Verification:

- The logic for counting the number of unaffected positions is correct.
- The dynamic programming approach correctly calculates the number of configurations for the remaining positions.
- The edge cases are handled appropriately.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:

The given Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
