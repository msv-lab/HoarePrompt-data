Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an integer from the input split, `c` and `r` are both integers, `num` is 4**.

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 2, starting from its initial value which is implied to be 2 (since no initial value is given and it's incremented by 2, the only logical initial value in this context would be 2). Therefore, `num` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
