Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `i` is `k`, `num` is the sum of increments based on the condition in the loop, and `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted during the final iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code sets `dp[2]` to 3. This updates the list `dp` at index 2. All other variables (`i`, `num`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
