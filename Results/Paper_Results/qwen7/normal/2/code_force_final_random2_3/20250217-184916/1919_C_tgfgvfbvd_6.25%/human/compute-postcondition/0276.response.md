Postcondition: `x` is `x + 1`, `n` must be greater than `x + 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` is the element at index `x` in list `l` if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, or `b` is the value at index `x` of list `l` if `l[x] - a` is less than `l[x] - b`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `a` is the element at index `x` in list `l`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged and `b` is set to the value of `l[x]`.
