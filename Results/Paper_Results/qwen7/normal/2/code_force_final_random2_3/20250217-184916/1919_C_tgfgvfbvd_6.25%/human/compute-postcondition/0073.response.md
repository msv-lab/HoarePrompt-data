Postcondition: `y` is `n`, and `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`. Specifically, if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1, and `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`; otherwise, `b` remains the maximum value. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`; otherwise, `b` remains the maximum value. If neither of these conditions is met, `b` remains unchanged.
