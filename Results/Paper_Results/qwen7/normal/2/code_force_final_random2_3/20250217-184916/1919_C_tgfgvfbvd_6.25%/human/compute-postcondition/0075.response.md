Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `x`. The loop iterates over the range from `y + 1` to `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is within the range `y + 1` to `n - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `y` is `n`.
   - `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating from `y + 1` to `n - 1`, the next value of `x` will be `y + 2` (assuming `y = n`).
   - The loop condition `x < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `y` remains `n` because it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `b` remains the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1` because it is not modified inside the loop either.
   - `x` will be incremented to `y + 2` (which is `n + 2`).

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`y` is `n`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`, `x` is `n + 2`**.
