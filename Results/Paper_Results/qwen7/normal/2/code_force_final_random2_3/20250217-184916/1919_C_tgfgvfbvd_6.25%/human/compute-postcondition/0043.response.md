Postcondition: `y` is `n - 1`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`. If the condition `(a - l[x] <= b - l[x])` is true for all `x` in the range from `y + 1` to `n - 1`, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is updated to the current value of `l[x]` where the condition is false for the first time.
