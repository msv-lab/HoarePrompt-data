Postcondition: `y` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l[1]` is greater than `l[0]`, and `b` is equal to `l[3]`. If `l[3]` is greater than `l[2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `l[3] > l[2]` is not met.
