Output State: **`y` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l[1]` is greater than `l[0]`, and `b` is equal to `l[3]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `y`, `n`, `l[1]`, `l[0]`, `b`, and `l[3]` remain unchanged, and we simply indicate that we break out of the loop or conditional statement.
