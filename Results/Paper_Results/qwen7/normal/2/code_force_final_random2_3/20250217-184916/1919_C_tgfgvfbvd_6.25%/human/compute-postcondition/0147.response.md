Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `y` is 3
   - `n` is greater than 4
   - The loop condition is `x in range(y + 1, n)`, which means `x` ranges from `4` to `n-1`.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop runs as long as `x` is less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the last value it had before the loop condition failed.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1.
   - Since `x` was previously `n-1` (the largest value it could have been before the loop condition failed), the next value for `x` would be `n`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `y` remains unchanged at 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged (it must still be greater than 4).
   - `x` is incremented to `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`y` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `x` is `n`**
