Postcondition: `y` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `x` is `n`. If the element at index `n` in list `l` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[n]` is less than or equal to `b - l[n]`, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, `b` is set to the element at index `n` in list `l`. If the element at index `n` in list `l` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[n]` is not less than or equal to `b - l[n]`, then `a` remains unchanged.
