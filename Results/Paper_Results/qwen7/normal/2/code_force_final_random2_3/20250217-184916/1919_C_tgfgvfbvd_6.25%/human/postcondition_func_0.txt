The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It identifies the smallest and second smallest unique elements in the list and counts the number of elements that are either greater than both these elements or closer to the smaller element than to the larger one when they are not greater than both. The function prints the count of such elements for each test case and does not return any value.
