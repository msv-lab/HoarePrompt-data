Postcondition: `l[x]` is an integer, `a` is an integer, and `b` is an integer. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` is true, then `a` is equal to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is equal to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x] > b - l[x]` is true, then `b` is set to `l[x]`.
