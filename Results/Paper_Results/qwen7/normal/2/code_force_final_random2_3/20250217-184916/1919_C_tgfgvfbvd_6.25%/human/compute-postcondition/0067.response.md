Output State: **`y` is `n`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`, `a` is the value of `l[x]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `l[x]` to the variable `a`. The values of `y` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `y` is still `n`, `b` is still the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`, and `a` now holds the value of `l[x]`.
