Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: y is 3, n is greater than or equal to 4, l[1] is greater than l[0], and b is equal to the maximum value among l[1], l[2], and l[3].
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `y` is 3 and `n` is greater than 4. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is increased by 1. Otherwise, either `a` is equal to `l[x]` and the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, or `b` is equal to `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `y` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `x` is `n`. If the element at index `n` in list `l` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` is 1. Otherwise, if the element at index `n` in list `l` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[n]` is less than or equal to `b - l[n]`, then `b` is set to the element at index `n` in list `l`. If the element at index `n` in list `l` is less than both `a` and `b`, but `a - l[n]` is greater than `b - l[n]`, then `a` is set to the element at index `n` in list `l`. If the element at index `n` in list `l` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `a` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `y` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, and `x` is `n + 1`. If the condition `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b` is true, then `c` is incremented by 1. If the condition is false, and `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` is true, then if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b` is false, then if `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `x` in list `l`, no change is made to `a` and `b` remains as the element at index `x` in list `l`. Otherwise, `a` remains as the element at index `x` in list `l` and `b` remains as the element at index `x` in list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
