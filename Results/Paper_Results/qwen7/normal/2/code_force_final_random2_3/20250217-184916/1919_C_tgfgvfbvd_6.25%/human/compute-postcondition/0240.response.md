Postcondition: `l[x]` is an integer, `a` is an integer, and `b` is an integer. If the value at index `x` in list `l` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then the value at index `x` in list `l` is adjusted to be the maximum of `a` and `b`. If the value at index `x` in list `l` is less than both `a` and `b`, and the difference between `a` and the value at index `x` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and the value at index `x`, then the value at index `x` in list `l` is set to `a`. Otherwise, the value at index `x` in list `l` is set to `b`. If the value at index `x` in list `l` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `a` is set to the value at index `x`. Otherwise, `l[x]` remains equal to `b`.
