Output State: **`l[x]` is an integer and greater than or equal to `a`; `a` is now equal to `l[x]`; `b` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the value of `l[x]` to `a`. Since `l[x]` is initially greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, after the assignment, `a` now holds the value of `l[x]`. The values of `l[x]` and `b` remain unchanged.
