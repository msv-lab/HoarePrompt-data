Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than `k`, and `soma_b` is equal to `lista_B[0] + lista_B[1]`**

Explanation: The code `soma_b += lista_B[i]` increments `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `soma_b` which was previously equal to `lista_B[0]` (from the initial condition) is now updated to `lista_B[0] + lista_B[1]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
