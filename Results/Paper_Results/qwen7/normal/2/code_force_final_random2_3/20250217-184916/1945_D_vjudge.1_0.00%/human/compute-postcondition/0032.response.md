Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be `n - k - 1`, `pref` will be the sum of all `lista_A[i]` where `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` plus the cumulative sum of `lista_B[i]` where `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` from `i=0` to `i=n-k-1`, and `soma_b` will be 0 if there was no `lista_A[i]` that was greater than or equal to `lista_B[i]` from `i=0` to `i=n-k-1`.

This means that `pref` accumulates the values from `lista_A` when the corresponding elements in `lista_A` are smaller than those in `lista_B`, and also adds the cumulative sum of `lista_B` when `lista_A` elements are not smaller. `soma_b` remains 0 because it gets reset to 0 whenever a condition is met in the if statement.
