Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `numero_testes` ≤ 10^4, and it is set to the integer value entered by the user.**

The code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `numero_testes`. This changes the value of `numero_testes` to the integer entered by the user while keeping the constraint 1 ≤ `numero_testes` ≤ 10^4. All other preconditions remain unchanged.
