Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n - k` to `n-1` (inclusive). The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - k`
   - `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[n - k + 1]`
   - `resultado` remains the same

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n - k` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n - k + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be `n - k + 1` and it must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `n - k + 1`.
   - `soma_b` will be increased by `lista_B[n - k + 2]` (since `i` was `n - k` and now it is `n - k + 1`, the next element to be added to `soma_b` is `lista_B[n - k + 2]`).
   - `resultado` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n - k + 1`, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[n - k + 2]`, `resultado` remains the same**
