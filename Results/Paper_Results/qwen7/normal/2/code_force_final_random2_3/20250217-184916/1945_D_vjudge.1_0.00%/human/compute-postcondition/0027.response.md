Output State: **`i` is 3, `pref` is `pref` + `lista_A[3]`, `soma_b` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `soma_b` is initialized to 0. The values of `i` and `pref` remain unchanged from their initial state. The expression `pref` is `pref` + `lista_A[3]` is not evaluated because `lista_A` is not defined in the given code snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `soma_b` is set to 0.
