Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reverses the input lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` before processing them. This reversal allows the algorithm to process the elements from the end of the list towards the beginning, which is necessary for calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` people.
   - The logic inside the loop correctly accumulates the cost based on the conditions provided in the problem statement. Specifically, it calculates the minimum cost by considering the cost of moving Kirill past each person in the queue and updating the cumulative sum of costs (`soma_b`) and the prefix sum of `lista_A` (`pref`).
   - The final loop iterates through the last `k` elements of the reversed lists, ensuring that the minimum cost is calculated for each possible position within the first `m` people.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case. It reads the number of test cases (`numero_testes`), and for each test case, it reads the necessary inputs and calls `func_1()` appropriately.
   - The function ensures that `func_1()` is called the correct number of times, which is essential for processing all test cases.

Given the analysis, both functions together correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. They handle the input, process the data according to the rules, and produce the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
