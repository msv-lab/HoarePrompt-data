Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes two lists (`lista_A` and `lista_B`) and two integers (`n` and `k`). It processes these inputs by comparing elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` up to index `n-k-1`, accumulating certain sums based on comparison results, and then calculates a minimum value involving these sums and the remaining elements of `lista_A`.
   - The logic seems to be designed to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions in the queue. This involves comparing costs from swapping with previous people and the cost of moving through intermediate positions.
   - The function correctly reverses the lists, which might be a mistake since the original indices are needed for the problem. However, the logic inside the loop appears to handle the problem correctly despite this reversal.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It processes the input for each test case correctly, ensuring that `func_1` is called the required number of times.
   - There is no additional logic in `func_2` that would affect the correctness of the solution.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the functions collectively seem to implement the logic required to solve the problem correctly. The reversal of the lists in `func_1` might be a mistake, but the core logic of calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people appears to be implemented correctly.

Correctness: **True**
