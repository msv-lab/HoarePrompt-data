### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Analysis:**
   - The function reads the input values for `n` and `k`, and the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
   - It reverses both lists, which is unnecessary since the problem does not specify that the order of elements matters. However, reversing them does not affect the logic of the algorithm.
   - It initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.
   - The first `for` loop iterates from `0` to `n - k - 1` and calculates the prefix sum of `lista_B` (`soma_b`) and the cumulative sum of `lista_A` where `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` (`pref`).
   - The second `for` loop iterates from `n - k` to `n - 1` and calculates the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions, updating `resultado` accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost (`resultado`).

2. **Function `func_2()` Analysis:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases (`numero_testes`).
   - It calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The function ensures that `func_1()` is called the correct number of times based on the number of test cases.

3. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - The logic in `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The code handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as the range of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`.
   - The code ensures that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
