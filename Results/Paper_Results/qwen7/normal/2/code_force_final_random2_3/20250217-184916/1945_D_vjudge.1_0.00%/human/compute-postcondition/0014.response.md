Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than `k`, and `soma_b` is equal to `lista_B[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `soma_b += lista_B[i]` increments `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `soma_b` is updated to be the value of `lista_B[0]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
