Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n - k` to `n-1` (inclusive). This means `i` starts at `n - k` and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - k`
   - `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]`
   - `resultado` is updated to be the minimum between `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n - k` and increments by 1, the next value of `i` will be `n - k + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new state should reflect `i` as `n - k + 1`.

5. **Maintain the other states**:
   - `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]`, so the new value of `soma_b` will depend on the current value of `i` (which is `n - k`).
   - `resultado` is updated based on the previous value of `i` (which is `n - k`), so its value remains the same for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `i` is `n - k + 1`
- `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[n - k]`
- `resultado` remains the same

So, the final state is:

**State: `i` is `n - k + 1`, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[n - k]`, `resultado` remains the same**
