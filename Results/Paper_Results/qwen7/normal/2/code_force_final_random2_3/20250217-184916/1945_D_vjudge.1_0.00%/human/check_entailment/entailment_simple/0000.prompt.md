Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

# Annotated Program:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, lista_A is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and lista_B is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be `n - k - 1`, `pref` will be the sum of all `lista_A[i]` where `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` plus the cumulative sum of `lista_B[i]` where `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` from `i=0` to `i=n-k-1`, and `soma_b` will be 0 if there was no `lista_A[i]` that was greater than or equal to `lista_B[i]` from `i=0` to `i=n-k-1`.
    #
    #This means that `pref` accumulates the values from `lista_A` when the corresponding elements in `lista_A` are smaller than those in `lista_B`, and also adds the cumulative sum of `lista_B` when `lista_A` elements are not smaller. `soma_b` remains 0 because it gets reset to 0 whenever a condition is met in the if statement.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `n - 1`; `soma_b` is the sum of `lista_B` from index `n - k` to `n - 1`; `pref` is the cumulative sum of `lista_A` from index `n - k` to `n - 2`; `resultado` is the minimum value obtained from the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In this final state, the loop has executed for all iterations from `i = n - k` to `i = n - 1`. The variable `i` has reached its maximum value of `n - 1`. The variable `soma_b` contains the sum of all elements in `lista_B` from the start of the loop until the last iteration. The variable `pref` holds the cumulative sum of `lista_A` from the start of the loop until the second-to-last iteration. The variable `resultado` retains the minimum value calculated during any iteration of the loop using the formula `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: resultado (the minimum value obtained from the expression pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] for each iteration of the loop)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numero_testes is an integer such that 1 ≤ numero_testes ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `func_1()` has been called `numero_testes` times.
    #
    #Explanation: Since the loop runs `numero_testes` times and `func_1()` is called in each iteration, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `func_1()` will have been called exactly `numero_testes` times. The value of `numero_testes` remains within the range \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^4\) as no operations inside or outside the loop change its value.
