Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that start <= end, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial values of `start`, `end`, and `t` remain unchanged.
