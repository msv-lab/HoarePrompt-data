Reasoning:
The given program consists of two separate parts: one that generates files for HTML in a specified directory range, and another that processes test cases involving binary strings. The execution summary describes the behavior of the second part of the program, which is a standalone function `func_1` and its usage within `__main__`.

The first part of the program, `generate_files_for_html_in_range`, is not described in the execution summary. However, the execution summary focuses on the behavior of `func_1`, which is unrelated to the file generation logic. Since the execution summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1`, we can conclude that the second part of the program is correct according to the provided information.

The correctness of the program is determined based on the provided execution summary, which accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. Therefore, the correctness of the program in terms of the described functionality is True.

Correctness: **True**
