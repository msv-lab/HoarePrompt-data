Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s`. **`cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or `cnt1` is odd**.
