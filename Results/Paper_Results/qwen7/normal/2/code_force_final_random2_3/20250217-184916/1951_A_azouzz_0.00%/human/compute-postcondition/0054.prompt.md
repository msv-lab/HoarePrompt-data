You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers such that start <= end, and both represent valid directory names without leading or trailing spaces.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt1 = s.count('1')
        
        if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
            print('NO')
        elif '11' in s:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The final state after the loop executes all its iterations will have the following characteristics:
    #
    #- `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
    #- `t` is the input integer that was initially provided and has been decremented by the number of times the loop ran until it reaches 0.
    #- `n` is the last input integer received during the loop's execution.
    #- `s` is the last input string received during the loop's execution.
    #- `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the last input string `s`.
    #
    #In this final state, the value of `t` will be 0 because the loop runs for `t` times and `t` is decremented by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `n` and `s` will be the inputs received during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `cnt1` will hold the count of '1' in the string `s` from the last iteration. The `start` and `end` values will remain as they were initialized since they are not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns None.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
