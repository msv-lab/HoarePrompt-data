Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is the input integer that must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the updated string `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is updated to the input string from the user, and `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the updated string `s`. If the string `s` contains '11', `cnt1` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `cnt1` remains unchanged.**
