Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine the outcome of a game between Alice and Bob based on their initial positions on a checkered board. The logic in the program seems to handle different scenarios and conditions correctly to determine the winner or if the game results in a draw. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key parts of the program and the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**: 
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is in a higher row than Alice's chip. If so, it immediately prints "Draw" because Alice cannot catch up to Bob.
   - If Bob's chip is in a lower row, the program proceeds to check further conditions.

3. **Movement and Winning Conditions**:
   - The program checks if the vertical distance between the two chips is even or odd.
   - Depending on the parity of the vertical distance, the program adjusts the positions of Alice and Bob's chips and checks if Alice can win by moving diagonally to Bob's position.
   - If Alice can't win, the program checks if Bob can win similarly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the chips are on the boundary of the board and ensures that the movements stay within the board boundaries.

Given the detailed comments and the logical flow of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the rules and logic described in the problem statement. The conditions and movements are handled appropriately, and the outcomes ("Alice", "Bob", or "Draw") are determined based on the optimal moves for both players.

Correctness: **True**
