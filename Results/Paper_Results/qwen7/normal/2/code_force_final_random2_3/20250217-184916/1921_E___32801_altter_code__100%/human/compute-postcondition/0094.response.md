Based on the initial state and the conditions provided, let's break down the values of the relevant variables:

1. **`t`**: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`r`**: A list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
3. **`n`**: The first element of `r`.
4. **`m`**: The second element of `r`.
5. **`x1`**: The third element of `r` increased by `a`.
6. **`y1`**: Either 1 or the fourth element of `r`.
7. **`x2`**: The fifth element of `r`.
8. **`y2`**: The sixth element of `r` decreased by `a`.
9. **`b`**: `x2 - x1`.
10. **`t`**: The absolute value of `y2 - y1`.
11. **`x2`**: Decreased by `a`.
12. **`x2`**: Greater than or equal to `x1`.
13. **`x1`**: Greater than or equal to 1.
14. **`x2`**: Less than or equal to `n`.
15. **`c`**: `m - y2`.

Given the else block condition:
- `b // 2 <= a`
- `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`
- `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m`
- `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`

Since these conditions must be true for the else block to execute, we need to determine if they hold based on the given constraints.

### Analysis:
1. **`b // 2 <= a`**: This means that half of `b` (which is `x2 - x1`) is less than or equal to `a`.
2. **`abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`**: This means the absolute difference between `x2` and `c` is less than the sum of `x1` and `c`.
3. **`y1 < 1` or `y1 > m`**: This means `y1` is either less than 1 or greater than `m`.
4. **`x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`**: This means `x1` is either less than 1 or greater than `n`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('draw')` will execute because the else block's conditions are satisfied.

Output: **draw**
