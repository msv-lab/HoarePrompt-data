Output State: **`r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `y1` is decreased by 1, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is `m`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, and the condition `(x2 > x1 and x1 ≥ 1 and x2 ≤ n and y2 > y1)` holds.**

Explanation: The code assigns `m` to `y2`. Since `m` is the second element of the list `r`, `y2` now equals `m`. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged.
