Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `y1` is decreased by `1 + a`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is either `m` or `1` depending on the condition, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, `c` is `m - y1` or `y1 - 1` depending on the condition, and the condition `(b // 2 ≤ a or abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c or (y1 < 1 or y1 > m) or (x1 < 1 or x1 > n))` holds.
