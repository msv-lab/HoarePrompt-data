Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is the third element of r, y1 is the fourth element of r, x2 is the fifth element of r, y2 is the sixth element of r, and y1 is not equal to y2, where y2 is less than y1, a is m - y1.**

In this output state, the variable `a` is assigned the value `m - y1`. All other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
