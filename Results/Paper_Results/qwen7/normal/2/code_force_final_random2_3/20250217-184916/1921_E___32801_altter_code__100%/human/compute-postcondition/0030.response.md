Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `y1` is decreased by 1, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is decreased by `a`.**

Explanation: The code `x2 -= a` decreases the value of `x2` by `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
