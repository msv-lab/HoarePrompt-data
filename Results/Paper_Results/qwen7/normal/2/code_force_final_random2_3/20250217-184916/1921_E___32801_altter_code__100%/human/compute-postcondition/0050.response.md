Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `y1` is decreased by `1 + a`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is either `m` or `1` depending on the condition, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, `b // 2 > a` holds, `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c` holds, `(1 <= y1 <= m)` holds, `(1 <= x1 <= n)` holds, where `c` is `m - y1` if `y2 == m` or `y1 - 1` if `y2 == 1`.
