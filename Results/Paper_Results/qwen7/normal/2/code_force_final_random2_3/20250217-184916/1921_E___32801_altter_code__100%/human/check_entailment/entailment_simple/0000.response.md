Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tt`) and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly extracts the board dimensions and initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Game Logic Analysis**:
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is in a higher row than Alice's chip (`x2 <= x1`). If true, it prints "Draw" and returns, which is correct because Alice cannot catch up to Bob.
   - If the difference in row positions between Bob and Alice is odd, it further checks if Alice's and Bob's chips are in the same column (`y1 == y2`). If true, it prints "Alice" because Alice can move diagonally to catch Bob.
   - The program then proceeds to simulate the movement of Alice and Bob to see if Alice can catch Bob. This involves adjusting the positions of Alice and Bob based on certain conditions and checking if Alice can win.

3. **Edge Cases and Conditions**:
   - The program handles various edge cases, such as when Alice and Bob are in the same column but different rows, and when the difference in row positions is even. It correctly simulates the movements and checks if Alice can catch Bob within the constraints.
   - The logic for determining if Alice can catch Bob is sound and follows the rules of the game.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the outcome of the game, which aligns with the problem description.

Given the analysis above, the program correctly implements the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given rules and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
