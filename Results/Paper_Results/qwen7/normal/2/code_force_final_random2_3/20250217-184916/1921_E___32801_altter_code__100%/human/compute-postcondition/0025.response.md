Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is increased by 1, y1 is decreased by 1, x2 is the fifth element of r, y2 is the sixth element of r, x2 is greater than x1, y1 is less than y2, a is m - y2**

Explanation: The code `a = m - y2` assigns the value of `m - y2` to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged from their previous states. The conditions that `x2` is greater than `x1` and `y1` is less than `y2` are still valid.
