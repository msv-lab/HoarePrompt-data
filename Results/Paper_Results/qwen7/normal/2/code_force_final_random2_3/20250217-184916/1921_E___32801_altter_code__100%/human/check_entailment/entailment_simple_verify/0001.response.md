### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Initial Setup**: The function `func_1()` correctly extracts the board dimensions and initial positions of Alice and Bob's chips. This part is also correct.

3. **Immediate Draw Condition**: The program checks if Bob's chip is initially in a lower row than Alice's. If so, it immediately prints "Draw". This condition is handled correctly.

4. **Odd Difference Check**: The program checks if the difference in rows between Bob's and Alice's chips is odd. If it is, it proceeds to check further conditions for Alice's win. This logic is correct.

5. **Even Difference Check**: If the difference in rows is even, the program checks for Bob's win. This logic is also correct.

6. **Movement Logic**:
   - **Alice's Moves**: The program attempts to simulate Alice's moves but does not correctly update the positions of Alice and Bob's chips. The logic for checking if Alice can force a win is flawed. Specifically, the program does not consider all possible moves and outcomes correctly.
   - **Bob's Moves**: Similarly, the logic for Bob's moves and win conditions is also flawed and does not correctly simulate the game.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, such as when Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board, or when the positions are very close to each other. The current implementation does not fully account for these scenarios.

Let's break down the specific issues:

- **Incorrect Movement Simulation**: The program incorrectly updates the positions of Alice and Bob's chips. For example, the lines `y1 += 1` and `x1 += 1` are applied in a way that does not reflect all possible moves. The program should consider all possible diagonal moves (down-right, down-left) and ensure that the new positions are within the board boundaries.
  
- **Win Conditions**: The win conditions are not correctly evaluated. The program does not properly simulate the game to determine if Alice or Bob can force a win. The current logic does not account for all possible sequences of moves and outcomes.

- **Boundary Conditions**: The program does not handle boundary conditions correctly. For instance, if Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board, the current logic does not account for this scenario and may lead to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly simulate the game and does not handle all possible scenarios and edge cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
