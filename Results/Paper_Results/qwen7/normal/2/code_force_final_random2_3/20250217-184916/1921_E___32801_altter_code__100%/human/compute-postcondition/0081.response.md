Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` increased by `a`, `y1` is 1, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r` decreased by `a`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `c` is `y2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `y2 - 1` to `c`. Since `y2` is the sixth element of `r` decreased by `a`, `c` is now `y2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
