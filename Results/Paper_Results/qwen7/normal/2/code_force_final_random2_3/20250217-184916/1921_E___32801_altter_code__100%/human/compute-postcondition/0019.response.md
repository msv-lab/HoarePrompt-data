Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `n` is the first element of `r`.
- `m` is the second element of `r`.
- `x1` is increased by 1.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `x2` is the fifth element of `r`.
- `y2` is the sixth element of `r`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The current value of `y1` is the same as its original value because the if condition `y1 == y2` is true.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement will simply print the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
