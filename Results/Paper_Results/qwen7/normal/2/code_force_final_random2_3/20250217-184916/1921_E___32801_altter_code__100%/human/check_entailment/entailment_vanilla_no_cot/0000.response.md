Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the outcome of the game. Here are some issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is incomplete**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called properly within the loop where it should process each test case. The correct implementation should call `func_1()` inside the loop that processes each test case.

2. **Incorrect handling of the game rules**: The logic for determining the winner is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for Alice and Bob winning are not correctly implemented. The program does not correctly handle the game states and the optimal moves for both players.

3. **Unnecessary complexity**: The program includes unnecessary complexity and checks that do not align with the game rules. For instance, the program unnecessarily calculates distances and makes assumptions about the relative positions of the chips that do not correctly reflect the game's logic.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
tt = int(input())
for _ in range(tt):
    r = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2) = (r[0], r[1], r[2], r[3], r[4], r[5])

    # If Alice is in the last row, it's a draw
    if x1 == n:
        print("Draw")
        continue

    # If Bob is in the first row, it's a draw
    if x2 == 1:
        print("Draw")
        continue

    # If Alice can reach Bob's position in one move, Alice wins
    if (x1 + 1, y1) == (x2, y2) or (x1 + 1, y1 + 1) == (x2, y2) or (x1 + 1, y1 - 1) == (x2, y2):
        print("Alice")
        continue

    # If Bob can reach Alice's position in one move, Bob wins
    if (x2 - 1, y2) == (x1, y1) or (x2 - 1, y2 + 1) == (x1, y1) or (x2 - 1, y2 - 1) == (x1, y1):
        print("Bob")
        continue

    # If Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, it's a draw
    if x1 == n or x2 == 1:
        print("Draw")
        continue

    # If the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves
    if (x2 - x1) % 2 == 0:
        print("Bob")
    else:
        print("Alice")
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic and directly checks the conditions for winning or drawing based on the game rules.
