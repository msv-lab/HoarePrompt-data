Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r`, `y1` is the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between `x2` and `x1` and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `b` is updated to `x2 - x1`.
