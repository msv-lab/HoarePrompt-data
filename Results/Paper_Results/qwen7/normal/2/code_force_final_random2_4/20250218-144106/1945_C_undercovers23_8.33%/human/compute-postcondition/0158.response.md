Postcondition: **`mini` will be the minimum value between its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` remains 5. `final` is an empty list, and `final` contains all elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference as `mini` with respect to `pk`, and `final` is sorted.**
