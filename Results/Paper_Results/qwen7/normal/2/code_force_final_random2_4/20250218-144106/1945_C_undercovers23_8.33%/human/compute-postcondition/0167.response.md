Postcondition: **`mini` will be the minimum value between its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` remains 5. `final` contains all elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference as `mini` with respect to `pk`, and `final` is sorted. If `len(final)` is 0, `final` will contain either [0] if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or it will include the value of `n` otherwise.**
