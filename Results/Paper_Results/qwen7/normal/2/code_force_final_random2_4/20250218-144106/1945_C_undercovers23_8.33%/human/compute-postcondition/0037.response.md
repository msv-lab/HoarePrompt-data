Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, if the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 2, otherwise `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, `lst` contains the element 3**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` equals 3. The values of `n`, `s`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, `lst` now contains the element 3.
