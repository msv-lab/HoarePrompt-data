Output State: **`o` is the count of '1' in the string `s`; `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `pk` is defined as `n // 2`; `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `lst`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
