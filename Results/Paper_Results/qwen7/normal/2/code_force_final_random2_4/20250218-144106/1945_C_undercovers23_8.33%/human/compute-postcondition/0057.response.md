Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Since `ele` is not defined in the initial state, it remains a placeholder for the current element in the list during iteration. The output state reflects that `mini` has been updated according to the given condition, while `lst` retains its initial condition of containing at least one element.
