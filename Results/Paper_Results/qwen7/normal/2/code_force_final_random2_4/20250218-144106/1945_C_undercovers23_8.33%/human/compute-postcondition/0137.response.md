Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is `ele`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The variable `ele` remains unchanged and is still equal to `next_ele`. Therefore, `mini` is updated based on the new comparison, and `ele` retains its previous value.
