Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` and the list `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `mini` remains the same (its state does not need to be adjusted).
   - `final` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `lst`. If `lst` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `lst`, `lst` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - No adjustments are needed for `mini` as it is stated to remain the same.
   - No adjustments are needed for `final` as it is already an empty list and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`lst` must have at least one element**
