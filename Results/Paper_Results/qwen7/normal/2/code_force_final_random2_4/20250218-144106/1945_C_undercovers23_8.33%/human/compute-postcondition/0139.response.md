Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in `lst`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The variable `ele` remains as the next element in the list `lst`. The initial state of `mini` being updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` is preserved, and `ele` continues to be the next element in `lst`.
