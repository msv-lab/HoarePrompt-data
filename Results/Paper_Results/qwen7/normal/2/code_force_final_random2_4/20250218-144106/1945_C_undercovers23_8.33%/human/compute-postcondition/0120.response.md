Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 0, and `lst` contains the values 3 and 4.**

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 3, `i + 1` equals 4. Therefore, the list `lst` now contains both 3 and 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
