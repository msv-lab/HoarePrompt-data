Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 2
   - `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[2]` is '0' or not
   - `zero_perc` is 33
   - `one` is 1
   - `one_perc` is 33
   - `lst` contains the value 3

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue if `i < n - 1`. Given that `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 3.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration (assuming the loop body does not change `i`), at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
- `i` is 3
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 3
- `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[2]` is '0' or not
- `zero_perc` is 33
- `one` is 1
- `one_perc` is 33
- `lst` contains the value 3

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[2]` is '0' or not, `zero_perc` is 33, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is 33, `lst` contains the value 3**
