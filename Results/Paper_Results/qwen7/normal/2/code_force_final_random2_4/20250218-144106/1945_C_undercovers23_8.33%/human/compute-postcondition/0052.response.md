Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `ele` and the list `lst`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition and Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the list `lst`.
   - After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
   - `zero` will be the count of '0's in the string `s`.
   - `one` will be the count of '1's in the string `s`.
   - `zero_perc` will be calculated based on the final value of `zero` and `i+1`.
   - `one_perc` will be calculated based on the final value of `one` and `n-i-1`.
   - `lst` will contain all indices `i+1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are 50 or more.

3. **Determine the Initial State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop continues until `lst` is empty, we need to ensure that `lst` is non-empty initially.
   - We don't need to adjust `i`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, or `lst` because these will be updated within the loop and their initial values do not affect whether the loop can execute.

4. **Finalize the State Adjustment**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `lst`, ensuring it contains at least one element before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`lst` must contain at least one element**.
