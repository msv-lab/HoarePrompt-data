Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `zero` is 1
   - `zero_perc` is 100
   - `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(100 / (n - 1))`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Given `i` is currently 1, `n - 1` must be greater than 1, meaning `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `n` must remain a positive integer greater than 2.
   - `zero`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` are not part of the loop head and thus do not change for the next iteration.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(100 / (n - 1))**
