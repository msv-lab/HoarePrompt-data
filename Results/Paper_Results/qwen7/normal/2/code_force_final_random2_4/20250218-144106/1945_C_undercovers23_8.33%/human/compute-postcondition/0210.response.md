Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[2]` is '0' or not, `zero_perc` is 33, `one` is either 1 or 2 depending on the execution path, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` contains the value 3.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `one_perc` to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Given the initial conditions, `o` (which is `one`) can be either 1 or 2, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 3. Since `i` is 3, the denominator `(n - i - 1)` simplifies to `(n - 4)`. The numerator `(o - one)` will be 0 if `o` equals `one`, and -1 or 1 otherwise. However, since `math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, `one_perc` will be 0 if `o` equals `one`, and 25 or 75 if `o` does not equal `one`. But given the initial condition that `one_perc` is 33, it implies that `o` does not equal `one`, and thus `one_perc` is recalculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - 4))` which results in `one_perc` being 33. All other variables remain unchanged.
