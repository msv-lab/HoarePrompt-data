Output State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `pk` and `mini` are such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, `final` contains the element `elem`.**

Explanation: The line `final.append(elem)` adds the element `elem` to the list `final`. The conditions regarding `pk` and `mini` remain unchanged, and `lst` still has at least one element. The only new information is that `final` now contains the element `elem`.
