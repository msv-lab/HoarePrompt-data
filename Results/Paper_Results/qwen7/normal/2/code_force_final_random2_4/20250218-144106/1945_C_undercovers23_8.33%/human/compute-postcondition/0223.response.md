Output State: **The value of `mini` remains the same, `final` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The given code initializes an empty list `final`. This operation does not affect the value of `mini` or any other variables from the initial state. Therefore, `mini` retains its initial value, which is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any of the elements in `lst` that satisfy the condition `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`. The list `final` is now an empty list.
