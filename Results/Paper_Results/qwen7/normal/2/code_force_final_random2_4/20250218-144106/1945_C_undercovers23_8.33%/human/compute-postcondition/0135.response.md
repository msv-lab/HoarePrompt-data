Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.**

This means that the variable `mini` is reassigned to the smaller value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The exact numerical value of `mini` depends on the current value of `mini` and the value of `abs(pk - ele)`.
