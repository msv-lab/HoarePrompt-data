Output State: `lst` contains all indices `i+1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are 50 or more; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its final value and `abs(pk - ele)` for every iteration of the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `lst` will include all indices `i+1` from the string `s` where the percentage of zeros (`zero_perc`) and ones (`one_perc`) are each 50% or more. Additionally, `mini` will hold the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` computed during the loop's execution.
