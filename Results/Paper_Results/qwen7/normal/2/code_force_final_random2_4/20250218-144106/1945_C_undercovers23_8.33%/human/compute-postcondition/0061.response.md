Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` and the list `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `final` is an empty list.
   - `mini` is defined as the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` for each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `lst`. For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `final` is an empty list, it doesn't affect the loop's execution directly.
   - `mini` is initialized before the loop starts, and its value will be updated during the loop iterations based on the elements in `lst`. However, for the loop to start, `lst` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `lst`, ensuring it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`final` is an empty list, `lst` must contain at least one element**
