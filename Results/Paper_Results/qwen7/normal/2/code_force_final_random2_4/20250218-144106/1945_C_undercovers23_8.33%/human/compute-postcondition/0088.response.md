To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. **`final` is a list**: This means `final` contains elements, but we don't know what those elements are yet.
2. **`mini` remains unchanged**: This indicates that `mini` is a variable that is not involved in the current logic and its value is irrelevant to the `final` list.
3. **`pk` remains unchanged**: Similarly, `pk` is another variable that is not relevant to the current logic.
4. **Condition for `final`**:
   - If `len(final)` is 0, then:
     - If `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` becomes `[0]`.
     - If `c1` is less than 50, `final` becomes `['n']`.

Given this information, we need to consider the condition for `final` to be set. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `o`, `n`, or `c1`, we must rely on the condition provided.

- If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` will be `[0]`.
- If `c1` is less than 50, `final` will be `['n']`.

Since the exact values of `o`, `n`, and `c1` are not provided, we can only describe the possible outcomes based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `c1`:
- If `c1 >= 50`, the output will be `0`.
- If `c1 < 50`, the output will be `'n'`.

Given the lack of specific values, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the conditions.

Output: **0 or 'n' (depending on the value of c1)**
