Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 0, and if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains the value 3**

Explanation: The value of `zero` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `lst` remains the same since no changes were made to `zero_perc` or `one_perc`.
