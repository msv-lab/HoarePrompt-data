Output State: **`mini` is 100000000, `o` is the count of '1' in the string `s`, `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `pk` is defined as `n // 2`, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `mini` to the value `10^8`, which is represented as `100000000`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
