Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, if the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 1, otherwise `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 0, `one_perc` is 50, and the condition `(zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50)` is true.**

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is initially 0, `i + 1` equals 1. The values of `n`, `s`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The condition `(zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50)` also remains true since no changes were made to `zero_perc` or `one_perc`.
