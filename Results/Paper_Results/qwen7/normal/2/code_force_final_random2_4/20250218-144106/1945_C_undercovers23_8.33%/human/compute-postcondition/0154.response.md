Postcondition: `lst` contains all its original elements plus the next element. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` contains all its original elements plus `elem`, and `pk` and `mini` remain the same. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged and `pk` and `mini` remain the same.
