Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((1 - 0) * 100 / (n - 0 - 1)) which simplifies to math.ceil(100 / (n - 1)).**

This means that `one_perc` is the ceiling value of 100 divided by `(n - 1)`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 0, `n - 1` is a positive integer less than `n`. The exact value of `one_perc` depends on the value of `n`.
