Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(100 / (n - 1))**.

Explanation: The code `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1. This value is appended to `lst`, but since the question only asks for the updated values of the variables, `i` is updated to 1. The values of `n`, `zero`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
