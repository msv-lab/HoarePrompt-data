Output State: **`final` is a list, `mini` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`final`, `mini`, `pk`, and `t`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
