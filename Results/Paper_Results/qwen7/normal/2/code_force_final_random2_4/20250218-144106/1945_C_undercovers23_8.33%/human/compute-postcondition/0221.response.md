Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the third element in `lst`**

Explanation: The code updates `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. Here, `ele` is specified to be the third element in `lst`. The value of `mini` is now adjusted based on this comparison, but `ele` remains the third element in `lst`.
