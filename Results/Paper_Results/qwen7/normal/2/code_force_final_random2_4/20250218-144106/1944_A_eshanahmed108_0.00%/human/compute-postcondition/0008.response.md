To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer.
   - `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
   ```

This code snippet uses a conditional expression to decide what to print based on the value of `n - k`:
- If `n - k <= 1`, it prints `n`.
- Otherwise, it prints `1`.

Let's analyze the condition `n - k <= 1`:
- This condition checks if `n` is at most one more than `k`.

Given that `n` and `k` are integer inputs, the value of `n` could be any integer, but `k` is also an integer input. Therefore, without specific values for `n` and `k`, we need to consider the general case.

### General Case Analysis:
- If `n` is exactly `k + 1` or less, then `n - k <= 1` is true, and the code will print `n`.
- If `n` is greater than `k + 1`, then `n - k > 1`, and the code will print `1`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, the output depends on their relationship. However, we can express the output in a general form.

### Output:
The output will be either `n` if `n` is at most one more than `k`, or `1` otherwise.

Output: **n if n is at most one more than k, otherwise 1**
