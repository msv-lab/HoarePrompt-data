Functionality: **The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks if \( n - k \leq 1 \). If true, it prints \( n \); otherwise, it prints \( 1 \). The function does not return any value but produces a series of outputs, either the original \( n \) or \( 1 \), based on the condition.**
