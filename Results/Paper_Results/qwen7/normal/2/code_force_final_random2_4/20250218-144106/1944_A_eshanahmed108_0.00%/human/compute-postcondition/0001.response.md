Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged from its initial state.
