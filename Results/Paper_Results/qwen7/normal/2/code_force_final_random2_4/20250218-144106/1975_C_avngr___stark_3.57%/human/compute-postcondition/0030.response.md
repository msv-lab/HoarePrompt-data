Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
   ```
   The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Analyze the Given States:**
   - `t` is an integer between 2 and 500.
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, and this minimum value is greater than the original `max`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` will now be 2).

Given these points, we need to update the states accordingly:

- `i` will be incremented to 2.
- `n` must remain greater than 2.

The other states (`t`, `a`, and `max`) do not change because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated states are:
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, and this minimum value is greater than the original `max`.**
