Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program only considers adjacent elements to find the maximum minimum pair in the array, but it does not account for the operations that Mocha can perform on any subarray to make all elements equal to the median of that subarray.

To solve this problem correctly, one should consider the median of the entire array and ensure that through the allowed operations, the array can be made uniform with all elements equal to this median. The current implementation does not achieve this and thus is incorrect.
