Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `max` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 with each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t` remains an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `i` changes to 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `a` remains a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `max` remains the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]`.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]`**
