Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the maximum value between any two consecutive elements in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The variables `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `max` is not yet defined or updated by this line of code, so its state remains as described in the initial state.
