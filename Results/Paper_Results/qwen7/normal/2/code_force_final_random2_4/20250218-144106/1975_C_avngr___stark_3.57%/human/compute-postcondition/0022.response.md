Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `max` is the maximum value between any two consecutive elements in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `max` remain unchanged from their initial states.
