Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `h` is an integer (but its value is not relevant to the print statement).
   - `w` is an integer (but its value is not relevant to the print statement).
   - `xa` is an integer (but its value is not relevant to the print statement).
   - `ya` is an integer (but its value is not relevant to the print statement).
   - `xb` is an integer (but its value is not relevant to the print statement).
   - `yb` is an integer (but its value is not relevant to the print statement).
   - `x` is calculated as `(abs(xa - xb) / 2)`.
   - `l` is calculated as `max(1, yb - x)`.
   - `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])`
   - This statement uses a conditional expression to decide between `'Draw'` and `'Alice'`.

3. **Conditional Expression:**
   - The condition is `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`.
   - Let's analyze this condition:
     - `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
     - `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` checks if the absolute difference between `r` and `ya` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.

4. **Values of `l` and `r`:**
   - `l = max(1, yb - x)`
   - `r = min(w, yb + x)`
   - Since `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) / 2)`, both `l` and `r` are dependent on `yb` and `x`.

5. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - If both conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` are true, then the result of the conditional expression will be `'Draw'`.
   - If either condition is false, then the result will be `'Alice'`.

6. **Output Determination:**
   - Without specific values for `yb`, `xa`, `xb`, `w`, and `ya`, we cannot definitively determine if the condition will be true or false.
   - Therefore, the output will depend on the values of these variables.

Given the lack of specific values for `yb`, `xa`, `xb`, `w`, and `ya`, the output is conditional and depends on those values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `'Draw'` or `'Alice'`.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Alice'] (depending on the values of `yb`, `xa`, `xb`, `w`, and `ya`)**
