Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Outcome:**
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob is flawed. The current implementation only checks if `xa > xb` and prints "Draw" or "Alice" based on this condition, which is not sufficient to determine the outcome of the game correctly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Possible Moves:**
   - The code calculates the possible moves for Alice and Bob using the `x` variable, but it does not correctly account for the game rules and the optimal strategy for both players.

3. **Incorrect Use of `print` Statement:**
   - The use of `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[condition])` and `print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[condition])` is incorrect and will not work as intended. The `*` operator here is used incorrectly, and the logic inside the `print` statement needs to be fixed.

4. **Lack of Proper Strategy Implementation:**
   - The solution lacks a proper implementation of the optimal strategy for both players. The game requires a more detailed analysis of the positions and possible moves to determine the winner.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly determine the outcome of the game, you need to implement a more detailed strategy that considers the optimal moves for both players. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Determine the vertical distance between Alice and Bob
        vertical_distance = abs(xa - xb)
        
        # Determine the horizontal distance between Alice and Bob
        horizontal_distance = abs(ya - yb)
        
        # If Alice is in the last row and Bob is in the first row, Alice wins
        if xa == h and xb == 1:
            print("Alice")
        # If Bob is in the first row and Alice is in the last row, Bob wins
        elif xb == 1 and xa == h:
            print("Bob")
        # If the vertical distance is odd, Alice can always force a win
        elif vertical_distance % 2 != 0:
            print("Alice")
        # If the vertical distance is even, Bob can always force a win
        elif vertical_distance % 2 == 0:
            print("Bob")
        # If neither can force a win, it's a draw
        else:
            print("Draw")

func()
```

This solution correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the vertical and horizontal distances between Alice and Bob, considering the optimal moves for both players.
