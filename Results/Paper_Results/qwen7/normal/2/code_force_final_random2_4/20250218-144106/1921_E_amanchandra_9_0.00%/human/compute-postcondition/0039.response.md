Output State: **`i` is 2, `h` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `xa` is an integer, `ya` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`**

Explanation: The variable `x` was previously calculated as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`. The code assigns `l` the value of `max(1, yb - x)`, which means `l` will be the maximum of 1 and the value of `yb - x`. The values of `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` remain unchanged.
