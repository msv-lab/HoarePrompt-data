Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases entered as input. For each iteration, the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` will hold the values obtained from the input for that specific test case. The variable `x` will be calculated based on the conditions within the loop body, either as `abs(xa - xb) // 2` or 0, depending on whether the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even or odd. The variables `l` and `r` will also be updated according to the conditions specified in the loop body, ensuring they are within the valid ranges defined by the problem constraints.

The final output of the program will consist of either 'Draw' or the name of the player ('Alice' or 'Bob') who wins the game, based on the calculations performed in each iteration of the loop.
