Output State: **`i` is 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers obtained from the input split, `x` is equal to the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is equal to 0, `l` is `ya - x` and its value is at least 1, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(w, yb + x)` to the variable `r`. Since `x` is already defined as `abs(xa - xb) / 2` and `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is equal to 0, `x` is an integer. The value of `r` is determined by comparing `w` and `yb + x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
