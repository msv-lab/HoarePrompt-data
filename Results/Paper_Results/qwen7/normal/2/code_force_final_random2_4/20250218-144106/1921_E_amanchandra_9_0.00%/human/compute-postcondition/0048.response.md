Postcondition: `i` is 2, `h` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `xa` is an integer, `ya` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `l` is an integer, and `r` is an integer. If `xa > xb` is true, then `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) / 2)`, `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`, and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`. If `xa <= xb` is true, then `x` is either `abs(xa - xb) // 2` (if `abs(xa - xb)` is odd) or 0 (if `abs(xa - xb)` is even), `l` is `max(1, yb - x)` when `x` is 0 and `max(1, ya - x)` otherwise, and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`.
