Output State: **`i` is 1, `h` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `xa` is an integer, `ya` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `x` is (abs(xa - xb) / 2), `l` is max(1, yb - x), `r` is min(w, yb + x)**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(w, yb + x)` to the variable `r`. The values of `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `x`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
