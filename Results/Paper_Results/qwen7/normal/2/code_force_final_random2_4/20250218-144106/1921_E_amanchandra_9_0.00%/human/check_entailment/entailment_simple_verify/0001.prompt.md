You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases entered as input. For each iteration, the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` will hold the values obtained from the input for that specific test case. The variable `x` will be calculated based on the conditions within the loop body, either as `abs(xa - xb) // 2` or 0, depending on whether the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even or odd. The variables `l` and `r` will also be updated according to the conditions specified in the loop body, ensuring they are within the valid ranges defined by the problem constraints.
    #
    #The final output of the program will consist of either 'Draw' or the name of the player ('Alice' or 'Bob') who wins the game, based on the calculations performed in each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`.

2. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `xa > xb`. If true, it prints "Draw". This condition is incorrect because the initial positions of the chips do not necessarily determine the outcome. We need to consider the optimal moves of both players.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the vertical distance between Alice's and Bob's initial positions using `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
   - This calculation is only relevant if the vertical distance is odd. If the distance is even, it uses a different approach.

4. **Horizontal Range Calculation:**
   - For odd distances, it calculates the horizontal range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
   - It then checks if the vertical distance between Alice's and Bob's initial positions is within this range plus one (`abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`).

5. **Decision Making:**
   - If the above condition is met, it prints "Alice".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

6. **Even Distance Handling:**
   - For even distances, it calculates a similar horizontal range but uses Alice's initial position `ya` instead of Bob's `yb`.
   - It checks if the vertical distance between Alice's and Bob's initial positions is within this range (`abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x`).

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Initial Condition:**
   - The condition `if xa > xb: print('Draw')` is incorrect. The initial positions alone do not determine the outcome; the optimal moves of both players are crucial.

2. **Horizontal Range Calculation:**
   - The logic for determining the horizontal range and checking the positions is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of both players.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the chips are very close to the boundaries of the board.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The given program does not correctly simulate the game dynamics and does not account for the optimal moves of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
