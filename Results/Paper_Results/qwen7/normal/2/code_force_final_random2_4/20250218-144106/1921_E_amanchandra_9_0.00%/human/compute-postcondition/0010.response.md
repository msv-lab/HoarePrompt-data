Output State: **`i` is 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers obtained from the input split, `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, and the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd; `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `yb + x` to `r`, where `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2. Since the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `x` is not an integer, but the division by 2 will truncate towards zero. The value of `r` is then the smaller of `w` and `yb + x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
