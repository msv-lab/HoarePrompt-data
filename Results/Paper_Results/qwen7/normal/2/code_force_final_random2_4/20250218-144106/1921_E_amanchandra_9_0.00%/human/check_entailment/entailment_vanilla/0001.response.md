Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`.

2. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `xa > xb`. If true, it prints "Draw". This condition is incorrect because the initial positions of the chips do not necessarily determine the outcome. We need to consider the optimal moves of both players.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the vertical distance between Alice's and Bob's initial positions using `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
   - This calculation is only relevant if the vertical distance is odd. If the distance is even, it uses a different approach.

4. **Horizontal Range Calculation:**
   - For odd distances, it calculates the horizontal range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
   - It then checks if the vertical distance between Alice's and Bob's initial positions is within this range plus one (`abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`).

5. **Decision Making:**
   - If the above condition is met, it prints "Alice".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

6. **Even Distance Handling:**
   - For even distances, it calculates a similar horizontal range but uses Alice's initial position `ya` instead of Bob's `yb`.
   - It checks if the vertical distance between Alice's and Bob's initial positions is within this range (`abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x`).

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Initial Condition:**
   - The condition `if xa > xb: print('Draw')` is incorrect. The initial positions alone do not determine the outcome; the optimal moves of both players are crucial.

2. **Horizontal Range Calculation:**
   - The logic for determining the horizontal range and checking the positions is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of both players.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the chips are very close to the boundaries of the board.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The given program does not correctly simulate the game dynamics and does not account for the optimal moves of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
