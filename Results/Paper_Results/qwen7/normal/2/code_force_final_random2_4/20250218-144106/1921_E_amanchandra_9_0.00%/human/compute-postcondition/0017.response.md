Postcondition: `i` is 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers obtained from the input split, `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. If the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `l` is `ya - x` and its value is at least 1, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
