Output State: **`i` is 0, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into six integers and assigns them to the variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 0. The input values for `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the split operation, and they are within the range specified (positive integers between 1 and \(10^4\)).
