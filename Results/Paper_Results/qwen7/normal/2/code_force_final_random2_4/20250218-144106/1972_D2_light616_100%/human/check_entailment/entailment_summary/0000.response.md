Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- The given solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` is designed to solve a single instance of the problem by iterating over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checking the conditions.
- `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
- The execution summary of `func_1` correctly describes its behavior and logic, ensuring that it counts valid pairs based on the given constraints.
- The execution summary of `func_2` correctly indicates that it processes multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

Given that both functions work as intended and cover all aspects of the problem, the overall program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
