### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` is initialized to 1.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` and `m` are read from input.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop runs while `x * x <= n`.
   - Inside this loop, `y` is initialized to 1.
   
3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop runs while `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - For each valid pair `(x, y)`, it checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`.
   - If the gcd condition is satisfied, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.

4. **State Analysis**:
   - After the outer loop, `x` will be incremented until `x * x > n`.
   - The inner loop will run for each valid `y` until the conditions are no longer met.
   - The final value of `cnt` is printed.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is read from input, representing the number of test cases.
   
2. **Loop Over Test Cases**:
   - The function calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Annotations Analysis:
- The annotation states that after the loop in `func_1`, `x` will be at least 5, `y` will be 5, `n` will be at least 10, `m` will be at least 20, and `cnt` will be 1. However, this is incorrect because the actual behavior of the program is more complex and depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **GCD Condition**:
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that `x` and `y` are coprime.
   - This is crucial for the gcd condition in the problem statement.

2. **Division Conditions**:
   - The conditions `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` ensure that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.
   - These divisions are used to count the number of valid pairs.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly and should work for all valid inputs within the specified range.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program logic is sound and correctly implements the problem requirements.
   - The annotations are misleading and do not reflect the actual behavior of the program.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
