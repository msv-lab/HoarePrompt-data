Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

### Loop Head
- The for loop is defined as: `for _ in range(t):`

### Analysis
- The loop variable `_` is an underscore, which means it is a placeholder and does not have a specific name. However, the loop itself depends on the value of `t`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.

### Adjusting the State
- Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is still a positive integer and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1 (since `range(t)` will generate `t` iterations, and each iteration reduces `t` by 1).

### New State
- After one iteration, `t` will be reduced by 1. Therefore, if `t` was initially a positive integer, after one iteration, `t` will still be a positive integer but decreased by 1.

### Conclusion
- The new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is now one less than its previous value, but still within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` is decreased by 1 from its previous value**. 

In a more concrete form, if the previous value of `t` was `k`, then the new value of `t` would be `k - 1`. However, since the exact previous value is not specified, we can simply state that `t` is a positive integer within the given range and has been decremented by 1.
