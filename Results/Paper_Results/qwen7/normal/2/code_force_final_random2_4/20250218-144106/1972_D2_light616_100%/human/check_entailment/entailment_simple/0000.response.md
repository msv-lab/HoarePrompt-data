### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - It iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(1 \leq x \leq \sqrt{n}\) and checks if the conditions \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) are met.
   - The logic inside the nested loops ensures that the gcd condition is checked and the count is updated accordingly.
   - The final output matches the expected results for the given examples.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2()` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The state after the loop in `func_2()` indicates that `t` is correctly set to 1 after processing all test cases, and `func_1()` is called the appropriate number of times.

3. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The main function `if __name__ == '__main__':` calls `func_2()`.
   - This ensures that the program processes all test cases correctly and prints the expected output.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem statement and matches the provided example outputs.
