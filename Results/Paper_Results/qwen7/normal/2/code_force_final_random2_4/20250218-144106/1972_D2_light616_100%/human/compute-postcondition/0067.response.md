Functionality: **The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the standard input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \) and \( n \times m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \). It then iterates over pairs of integers \( (x, y) \) starting from \( (1, 1) \) up to the point where \( x^2 > n \) and \( (x + y) \times x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \times y \leq m \). For each valid pair \( (x, y) \) where \( \text{gcd}(x, y) = 1 \), it increments a counter \( cnt \) by the minimum of \( \frac{n}{(x + y) \times x} \) and \( \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y} \). Finally, it prints the value of \( cnt \), which is guaranteed to be 1 based on the given constraints and logic. The function does not return any value.**
