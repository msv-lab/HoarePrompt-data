Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is 1
   - `y` is 3
   - `n` must be at least 3
   - `m` must be at least 6
   - The greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` remains 1.

3. **Evaluate the loop condition with current values**:
   - Calculate `(x + y)`: \(1 + 3 = 4\)
   - Check `(x + y) * x <= n`: \(4 * 1 = 4 \leq n\) (This requires `n` to be at least 4)
   - Check `(x + y) * y <= m`: \(4 * 3 = 12 \leq m\) (This requires `m` to be at least 12)

4. **Determine what needs to change for the loop to continue**:
   - For the first part of the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` to be true, `n` must be at least 4.
   - For the second part of the condition `(x + y) * y <= m` to be true, `m` must be at least 12.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `n` must be at least 3 and now we need it to be at least 4, we need to ensure `n` is at least 4.
   - Similarly, since `m` must be at least 6 and now we need it to be at least 12, we need to ensure `m` is at least 12.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 1, `y` is 3, `n` must be at least 4, `m` must be at least 12, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` remains 1**
