Output State: `x` is greater than the square root of `n`, `y` is 5, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20, and `cnt` is 1.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `x` will be greater than the square root of `n`. This is because the loop continues as long as `x * x <= n`. Since the loop has completed all its iterations, `x` must now be greater than the square root of `n`. The value of `y` remains 5 as it is incremented within the inner loop but does not exceed 5 based on the given conditions. The values of `n` and `m` must remain at least 10 and 20 respectively, as these were the minimum values required for the loop to execute up to three times. Finally, `cnt` remains 1 because no additional terms were added to `cnt` in the last iteration since `x` was already greater than the square root of `n`, preventing further iterations of the outer loop.
