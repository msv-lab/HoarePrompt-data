Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignment or modification of variables like `t`), the value of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only information that is updated is the fact that `func_1()` was called, but the value of `t` stays the same as it was in the initial state.
