Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is a positive integer initially and it is decreased by 1 after each iteration, the loop will continue until `t` becomes 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `t` is decreased by 1 from its previous value.
   - `func_1()` has been called.

4. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `t` is decreased by 1 after each iteration, if `t` was greater than 1 before the last iteration, it will now be `t-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Therefore, `t` should be greater than or equal to 1 (since it was greater than 1 before the last iteration and is now `t-1`).

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
   - `func_1()` will be called again in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` is greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called.**
