### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program implements the solution to the problem accurately. Let's break down the key points to confirm this:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), which is a necessary condition for the pair \((a, b)\) to be valid.
   - It then checks if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\), which is the main condition specified in the problem.
   - The count `cnt` is incremented appropriately based on the valid pairs found.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly processes up to 10,000 test cases as stated in the problem description.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided examples and the general logic of the code ensure that the program works correctly for various inputs, including edge cases like \(n = 1\) and \(m = 1\).

Given the detailed analysis and the function summaries, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
