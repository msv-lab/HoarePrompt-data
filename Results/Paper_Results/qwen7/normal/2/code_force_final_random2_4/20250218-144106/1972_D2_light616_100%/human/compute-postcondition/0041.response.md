Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 5, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20, and `cnt` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Initially, `x` is 2. After executing `x += 1`, the value of `x` becomes 3. The values of `y`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states. Therefore, `y` is still 5, `n` is still at least 10, `m` is still at least 20, and `cnt` is still 1.
