Output State: **`x` is 1, `y` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `m` must be at least 6, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` remains 1**.

The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n` and `m` (being at least 3 and 6 respectively) and the greatest common divisor condition for `x` and `y` remain valid.
