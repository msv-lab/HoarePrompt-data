Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 2, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20, and `cnt` is 1**

Explanation: The code `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. Initially, `y` is 1, so after executing the code, `y` becomes 2. The values of `x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
