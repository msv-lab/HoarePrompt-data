Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9). m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, x_i and y_i are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n.**
