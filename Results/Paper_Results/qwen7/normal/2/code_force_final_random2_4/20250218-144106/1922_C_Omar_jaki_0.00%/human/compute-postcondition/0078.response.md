Postcondition: **`total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, the first element of `a` is -1000000000.0, the second, third, and fourth elements of `a` are any values, `b` is a list where each element is the sum of the previous two elements plus `v` if certain conditions are met during each iteration of the loop, `u` is `False`, `c` and `d` are the results of the function `r()`, and `c` is updated based on the comparison with `d`. If `c < d`, then `c` is updated accordingly; otherwise, `c` remains unchanged.**
