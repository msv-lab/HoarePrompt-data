You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: Output State: `t` is a non-empty value decreased by the total number of iterations of the loop, `r()` has been called `m` times, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements where the first element is -1000000000.0 and the next three elements can be any values, `b` is a list where each element is the sum of the previous two elements plus `v` if certain conditions are met during each iteration of the loop, `u` is `False`, `c` and `d` are the return values of `r()` after the loop has executed all its iterations.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be the initial non-empty value decreased by the total number of iterations (which is `m` in this case). The function `r()` is called `m` times during these iterations. The list `a` remains unchanged as it was initialized to `[0, 0, 0, 0]` and is not modified within the loop. The list `b` is constructed based on the conditions inside the loop, and since the loop runs `m` times, `b` will have `2m` elements. The variable `u` is the return value of `r()` and is decreased to `0` after `m` iterations, making it `False`. The variables `c` and `d` are updated to the return values of `r()` at each iteration but their final values are the result of the last call to `r()` within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Let's analyze the code and the problem requirements:

1. **Problem Requirement**: The task is to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities, where the cost of moving to the closest city is 1 coin, and moving to any other city costs the absolute difference in their positions.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses a lambda function `r` to read input values.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the positions of the cities `a`, the number of queries `m`, and the pairs of cities for the queries.
   - The array `a` is modified to include `-1000000000.0` at the start and `2000000000.0` at the end to handle boundary conditions.
   - The array `b` is initialized to store intermediate results.
   - The `for` loop iterates through the modified array `a` and calculates some values, but these calculations do not seem to align with the problem's requirements.
   - The final part of the code processes the queries and prints the results using the precomputed values in `b`.

3. **Issue Identification**:
   - The core issue lies in the calculation within the `for` loop. The values being added to `b` do not represent the correct distances or the minimum cost to reach the closest city.
   - Specifically, the expression `v ** (v > x - w)` and similar expressions do not correctly compute the minimum cost to move to the closest city.
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost to travel between two cities is not implemented correctly. The code seems to be attempting to calculate something related to the differences between consecutive elements, but it does not account for the unique closest city property and the cost of moving to the closest city.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
