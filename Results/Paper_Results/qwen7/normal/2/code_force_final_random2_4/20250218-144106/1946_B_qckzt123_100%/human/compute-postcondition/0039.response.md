Output State: **`ans` is `ans` modulo `MOD` plus `t`, `t` is `t % MOD`, `i` is `i_end + 2`, and `k` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `ans += t` adds the value of `t` to `ans`. Since `t` is already defined as `t % MOD`, its value remains unchanged. The other variables (`i` and `k`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `ans` is updated to be its current value plus `t`, while `t` remains `t % MOD`.
