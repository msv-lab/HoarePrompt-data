Output State: **`ans` is `ans` modulo `MOD` plus `t`, `t` is `t % MOD`, `i` is `i_end + 1`, and `k` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `ans += t` adds the value of `t` to `ans`. Since `ans` was initially `ans` modulo `MOD`, and `t` is `t % MOD`, the new value of `ans` will be the old value of `ans` modulo `MOD` plus `t`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.
