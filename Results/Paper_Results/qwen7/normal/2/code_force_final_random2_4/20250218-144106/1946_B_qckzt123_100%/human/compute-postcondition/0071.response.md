Output State: **`i` is 0; `k` must be greater than 1; `t` is 2**.

Explanation: The variable `t` is multiplied by 2. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `t`, and no initial value is given, we assume `t` was initially 1 (a common default value for multiplication operations when no other value is specified). After the operation, `t` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
