Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 2, `t` is 4 % MOD, `ans` is (ans + t) % MOD**

Explanation: The code `ans += t` increments `ans` by the value of `t`. Given that `t` is equal to `4 % MOD`, the updated value of `ans` is `(ans + t) % MOD`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and `t` is still `4 % MOD`.
