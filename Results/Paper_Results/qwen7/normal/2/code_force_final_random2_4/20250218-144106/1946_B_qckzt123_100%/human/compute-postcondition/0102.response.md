Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `tmp` is equal to `tmp + x`, `t` is equal to `max(0, t)`**.

Explanation: The code `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`, which is the second element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `a` remains a list of integers with at least one element, `x` remains the second element in the list `a`, and `t` remains equal to `max(0, t)`.
