Output State: **`i` is 0; `k` must be greater than 1; `t` is 2 % MOD**

The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t % MOD`. Given that `t` is initially 2, the value of `t` after the operation will be `2 % MOD`. Since `MOD` is not specified, we keep it as `MOD` in the output state. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
