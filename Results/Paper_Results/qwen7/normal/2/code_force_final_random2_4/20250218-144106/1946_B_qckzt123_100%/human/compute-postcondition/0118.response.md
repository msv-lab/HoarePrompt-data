Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2 % MOD, `i` must be less than `k - 1`**

The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to `t % MOD`. Given that `t` was initially 2, the new value of `t` is `2 % MOD`. Since the initial value of `t` is 2, and no specific value for `MOD` is given, the output state retains the condition that `i` must be less than `k - 1`.
