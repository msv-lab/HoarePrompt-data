Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `tmp` is the sum of `tmp` and the third element in `a`, and `t` is equal to `max(tmp, t)`. If `tmp` is less than 0, then `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged, and `t` is still equal to `max(tmp, t)`.
