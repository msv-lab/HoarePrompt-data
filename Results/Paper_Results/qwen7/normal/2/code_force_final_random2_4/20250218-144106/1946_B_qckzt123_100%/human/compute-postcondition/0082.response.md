Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 3, `t` is 8 % MOD, `ans` is `ans` % MOD, `t` is now `t % MOD`**

Explanation: The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t % MOD`. Since the initial state of `t` is `8 % MOD`, after executing the code, `t` remains `8 % MOD`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation.
