Output State: **`i` is 2; `t` is 0; `ans` is 4 % MOD**

The code `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` by performing a modulus operation with `MOD`. Given that the initial value of `ans` is `4 % MOD + 0`, which simplifies to `4 % MOD`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged after the operation. Therefore, `ans` is still `4 % MOD`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unaffected.
