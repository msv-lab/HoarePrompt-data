Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k-1`, `t` will be \(2^{k-1} \mod \text{MOD}\), and `ans` will be the sum of all `t` values from \(2^0 \mod \text{MOD}\) to \(2^{k-1} \mod \text{MOD}\) modulo `MOD`.**

To break it down further:
- `i` will be `k-1` because the loop runs `k-1` times.
- `t` will be \(2^{k-1} \mod \text{MOD}\) because it doubles each time until just before it would exceed the limit, then stops.
- `ans` will be the cumulative sum of all these values of `t` taken modulo `MOD`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will reflect the total number of iterations minus one, `t` will hold the maximum value it reached (which is \(2^{k-1} - 1\) modulo `MOD`), and `ans` will be the sum of all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{k-1}\) modulo `MOD`.
