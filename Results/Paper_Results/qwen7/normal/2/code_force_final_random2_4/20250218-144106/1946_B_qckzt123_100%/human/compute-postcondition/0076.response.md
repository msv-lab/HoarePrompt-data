Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 2, `t` is 4 % MOD, `ans` is `ans` % MOD**

Explanation: The code `t *= 2` multiplies the current value of `t` by 2. Given that `t` was initially `2 % MOD`, after executing the code, `t` becomes `4 % MOD`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
