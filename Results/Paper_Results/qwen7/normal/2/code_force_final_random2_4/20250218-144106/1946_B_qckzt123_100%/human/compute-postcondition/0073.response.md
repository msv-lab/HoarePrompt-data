Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 1, `t` is 2 % MOD, `ans` is `ans` + 2 % MOD**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `t`, which is `2 % MOD`. The other variables (`i` and `k`) remain unchanged. The value of `t` is kept as `2 % MOD` since `MOD` is not specified and remains as is.
