Output State: **`t` is the maximum value that `tmp` ever reached (or 0 if `tmp` never exceeded 0), `tmp` is 0, `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `ans` is \(((s + t) \% MOD + MOD) \% MOD\)**.

Explanation: The code snippet calculates `ans` using the formula `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. Here, `s` is 0, and `t` is the maximum value that `tmp` ever reached. Since `tmp` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration of the loop and is only incremented by the values in `a`, and since `a` is an empty list, `tmp` will never be incremented and thus remains 0 throughout the loop. Therefore, `s + t` is `0 + 0`, which is 0. Applying the modulo operation with `MOD` to 0 results in 0. Adding `MOD` to 0 and then taking modulo `MOD` again still results in 0. Thus, `ans` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
