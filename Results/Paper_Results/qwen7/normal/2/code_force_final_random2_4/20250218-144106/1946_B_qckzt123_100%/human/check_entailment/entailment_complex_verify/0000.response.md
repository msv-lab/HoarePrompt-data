### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a`.
   - It calculates the sum `s` of the array `a`.
   - It also calculates the maximum prefix sum `t` where negative sums are discarded. This is done using a simple loop where `tmp` accumulates the sum of elements, and if `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to zero. The maximum value of `tmp` is stored in `t`.

2. **First Operation**:
   - The initial value of `t` is added to `s`, giving the best possible sum after the first operation.

3. **Subsequent Operations**:
   - For each additional operation, the program doubles the current maximum sum (`t`), ensuring that the sum grows exponentially. This is done by multiplying `t` by 2 and taking the result modulo `MOD`.
   - The doubled value is then added to `ans`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large sums, as required by the problem statement.

### Key Points to Verify:

- **Handling Negative Sums**: The program correctly discards negative sums by resetting `tmp` to zero when it becomes negative. This ensures that only positive contributions are considered.
- **Exponential Growth**: Doubling `t` in each iteration ensures that the sum grows optimally with each operation.
- **Modulo Operation**: The use of modulo ensures that the result fits within the required range and avoids overflow issues.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: `T = 1`, `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `a = [-4, -7]`
     - `s = -11`
     - `t = 0` (since the maximum prefix sum without negative contributions is 0)
     - After first operation: `ans = (-11 + 0) % 1000000007 = -11 % 1000000007 = 999999996`
     - After second operation: `t = 0 * 2 % 1000000007 = 0`, `ans = (999999996 + 0) % 1000000007 = 999999996`
     - Output: `999999996` (Correct)

   - **Case 2**: `T = 1`, `n = 3`, `k = 3`, `a = [2, 2, 8]`
     - `s = 12`
     - `t = 12` (since the maximum prefix sum is 12)
     - After first operation: `ans = (12 + 12) % 1000000007 = 24`
     - After second operation: `t = 12 * 2 % 1000000007 = 24`, `ans = (24 + 24) % 1000000007 = 48`
     - After third operation: `t = 24 * 2 % 1000000007 = 48`, `ans = (48 + 48) % 1000000007 = 96`
     - Output: `96` (Correct)

   - **Case 3**: `T = 1`, `n = 1`, `k = 7`, `a = [7]`
     - `s = 7`
     - `t = 7` (since the maximum prefix sum is 7)
     - After first operation: `ans = (7 + 7) % 1000000007 = 14`
     - After second operation: `t = 7 * 2 % 1000000007 = 14`, `ans = (14 + 14) % 1000000007 = 28`
     - After third operation: `t = 14 * 2 % 1000000007 = 28`, `ans = (28 + 28) % 1000000007 = 56`
     - After fourth operation: `t = 28 * 2 % 1000000007 = 56`, `ans = (56 + 56) % 1000000007 = 112`
     - After fifth operation: `t = 56 * 2 % 1000000007 = 112`, `ans = (112 + 112) % 1000000007 = 224`
     - After sixth operation: `t = 112 * 2 % 1000000007 = 224`, `ans = (224 + 224) % 1000000007 = 448`
     - After seventh operation: `t = 224 * 2 % 1000000007 = 448`, `ans = (448 + 448) % 1000000007 = 896`
     - Output: `896` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after performing the specified operations. It handles both positive and negative elements in the array and ensures that the sum grows optimally with each operation. The use of modulo ensures that the result fits within the required range and avoids overflow issues.
