Output State: **`i` is 2; `t` is 0; `ans` is 4 % MOD**

Explanation: The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t` modulo `MOD`. Given that `t` is initially `8 % MOD`, and since `8 % MOD` is simply `8` (assuming `MOD` is at least 9), the operation `t %= MOD` effectively sets `t` to `0` because `8 % MOD` is `8` and `8 % MOD` is `0` when `MOD` is greater than `8`. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged.
