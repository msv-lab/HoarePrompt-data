Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `c` is updated to `c + 1`.
- `n` is an input integer.

The print statement is simply printing the string `'##..##'`.

Since no specific values are assigned to `casos`, `t`, `c`, or `n`, and the print statement does not depend on these variables, the output will be the string `'##..##'`.

Output: **'##..##'**
