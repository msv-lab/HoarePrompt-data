Output State: **`casos` must be greater than 0, `c` is `c + 1`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\), and `n` is an integer input.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`casos`, `c`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
