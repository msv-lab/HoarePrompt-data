Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to generate a 2n × 2n checkerboard pattern for any given n. The program uses hardcoded patterns for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4, but fails to provide a general solution for other values of n. Specifically:

- For n > 4, the program prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range"), which is incorrect since the problem description states that the input n should be in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
- Even for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4, the program does not follow the checkerboard pattern as described in the problem statement. The provided patterns do not alternate between '#' and '.' in a checkerboard fashion.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
