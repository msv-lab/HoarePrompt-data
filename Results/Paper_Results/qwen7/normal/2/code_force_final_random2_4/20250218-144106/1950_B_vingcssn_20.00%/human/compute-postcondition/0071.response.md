Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is `c + 1`, but since `c` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its value.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is an integer input.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `..##`.

Since no specific values for `c` or `t` are given, and these do not affect the output of the `print` statement, the output remains as specified.

Output: **..##**
