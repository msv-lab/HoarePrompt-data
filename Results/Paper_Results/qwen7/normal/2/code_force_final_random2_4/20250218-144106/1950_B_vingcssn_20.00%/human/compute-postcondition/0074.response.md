Output: **##..##**

Explanation: The initial state does not provide any specific values for the variables `casos`, `c`, `t`, or `n`. The only print statement given is `print('##..##')`, which directly outputs the string `##..##`. Since no other variables or objects are involved in this print statement, the output remains as the string provided in the print statement itself.
