Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `c` is updated to `c + 1`.
- `n` is an input integer.

The print statement is simply `print('##..##')`.

Since the print statement does not reference any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, and it directly prints the string `'##..##'`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **##..##**
