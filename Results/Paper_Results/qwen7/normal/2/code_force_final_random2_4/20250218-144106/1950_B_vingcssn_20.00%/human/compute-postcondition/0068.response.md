Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is `c + 1`, but the value of `c` before this operation is not specified.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is an integer input.

The print statement is simply `print('##')`.

Since the print statement does not reference any of the variables `casos`, `c`, `t`, or `n`, and it only prints the string `'##'`, the output will be:

Output: **##**
