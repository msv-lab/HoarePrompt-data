You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

    #State: Output State: `casos` is decremented by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0, `c` equals `casos` after all iterations, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\), and `n` is an integer input for each iteration from the user. After all iterations, the loop will have printed patterns based on the value of `n` for each iteration, and `casos` will be 0.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `casos` will be 0 (since it starts as an input integer between 1 and 20 and is decremented by 1 each time through the loop), `c` will equal the original value of `casos` (as it is incremented once per iteration), `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop, and `n` represents the integer inputs provided by the user for each iteration of the loop. The loop will have printed the corresponding patterns based on the value of `n` for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. The function `func()` reads the number of test cases (`casos`) from input.
2. It then iterates over each test case using a loop.
3. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
4. The program checks specific values of `n` (1, 2, 3, 4) and prints the corresponding 2x2, 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 checkerboards respectively.
5. If `n` does not match any of the specified values, it prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range" in Spanish).

Now, let's consider the requirements of the problem:
- We need to generate a 2n x 2n checkerboard.
- The top-left cell should be '#'.
- The pattern should alternate between '#' and '.'.
- The checkerboard should be generated for any `n` within the range 1 to 20.

The program only handles specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and does not provide a general solution for any `n` within the required range. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem's requirements for arbitrary values of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct because it does not handle all possible values of `n` within the specified range.
