The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is 3.
- \(n \neq 2\).

The `print` statement in the code snippet simply prints the string `##..##`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `##..##` without any reference to the other variables since they are not used in the print statement.

Output: **##..##**
