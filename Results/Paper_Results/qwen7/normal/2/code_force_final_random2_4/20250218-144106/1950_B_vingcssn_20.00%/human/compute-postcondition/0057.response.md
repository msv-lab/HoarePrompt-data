Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `c` is updated to `c + 1`.
- `n` is an input integer.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'##..##..'`.

Since no specific value for `c` or `n` is mentioned, they do not affect the output of the print statement.

Output: **##..##..**
