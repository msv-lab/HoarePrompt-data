Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a 2n Ã— 2n checkerboard for arbitrary values of n within the given constraints. It only handles specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and prints hardcoded patterns for these cases. For any other value of n, the program will print "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range"), which is incorrect according to the problem description. The program should generate a checkerboard pattern for any valid n, not just the specified cases.
