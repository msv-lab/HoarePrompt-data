Postcondition: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is either 25001 or 50001, `R` is either 50002 or 25001, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, and `x` is now (`L` + `R`) // 2.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. It covers both cases: when the condition `numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x)` is true and when it is false.
