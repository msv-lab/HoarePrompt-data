Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001**

Explanation: The value of `x` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the expression `(L + R) // 2` evaluates to `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which is `100002 // 2`, resulting in `50001`. The values of `L`, `R`, and `numCuts` remain unchanged.
