Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` simply reassigns the value of `numCuts` to 0. This does not affect the values of `leftover` or `x`. Therefore, the values of `leftover` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
