Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `R` is 50002, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the function `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`. However, since the function `dfs` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact value of `leftover`. The values of `numCuts`, `L`, `R`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
