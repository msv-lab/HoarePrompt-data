Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `b` is an integer equal to the second number inputted, `adj[b]` now contains `a` and includes the appended value `a`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n - 1`, two integers `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into a list and converted to integers, `adj[a]` now contains the value `b` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into a list and converted to integers, `adj[a]` now includes the value `b` appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
