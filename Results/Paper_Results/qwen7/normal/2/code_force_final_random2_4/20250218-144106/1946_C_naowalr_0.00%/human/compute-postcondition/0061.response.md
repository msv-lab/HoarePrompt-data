Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is the first integer from user input.
   - `b` is the second integer from user input.
   - `adj[b]` now contains `a` appended to it.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1):`.
   - This means the loop will iterate from `0` to `n-2`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n - 2`, the next value of `i` would be `n - 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will increment by 1, so `i` will become `n - 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `a`, `b`, and `adj[b]` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the first integer from user input; `b` is the second integer from user input; `adj[b]` contains `a` appended to it; `i` is `n - 1`**.
