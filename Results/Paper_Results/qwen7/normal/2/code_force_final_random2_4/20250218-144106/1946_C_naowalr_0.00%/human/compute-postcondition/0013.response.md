Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is 2, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b, a]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, b]`**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and assigns them to `a` and `b`. It does not affect the values of `n` and `i`, nor does it modify the lists `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` beyond what was already specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state.
