Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `b` is an integer equal to the second number inputted, `adj[b]` now contains `a` and includes the appended value `a`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[b]`. Since `a` was already in `adj[b]` (from the initial state), appending `b` again does not change the fact that `a` is in `adj[b]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and it remains less than `n - 1`.
