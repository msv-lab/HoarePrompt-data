Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `k` is an integer equal to the second number inputted, and we read two integers from the standard input separated by space.**

This means that the code reads two integers from the standard input (usually the console), splits them by space, and converts them to integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
