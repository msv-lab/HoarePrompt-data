Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1), `L` is `x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x` to the variable `L`. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes these updated values for all variables involved.
