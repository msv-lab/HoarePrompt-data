Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `k` is an integer equal to the second number inputted.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings. Then, `map(int, ...)` converts these strings into integers. Finally, `n, k = ...` assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `k`. Therefore, `n` is set to the first integer inputted, and `k` is set to the second integer inputted. All other variables remain in their initial state, which is not specified but can be assumed to be unchanged.
