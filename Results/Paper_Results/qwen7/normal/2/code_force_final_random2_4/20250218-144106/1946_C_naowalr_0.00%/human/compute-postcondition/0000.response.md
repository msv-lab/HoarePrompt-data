Output State: **`t` is an integer read from stdin, representing the number of test cases; n and k are positive integers such that 1 â‰¤ k < n â‰¤ 10^5 for each test case; adj is a list of lists where adj[i] contains the list of vertices adjacent to vertex i.**

The code reads an integer from standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This changes the value of `t` to the integer read from stdin, while the values of `n`, `k`, and `adj` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
