Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `R` is `x`.**

Explanation: The variable `R` is assigned the value of `x`. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `(numCuts <= k and leftover < x)` is not directly affected by this assignment, so it remains part of the postcondition as given.
