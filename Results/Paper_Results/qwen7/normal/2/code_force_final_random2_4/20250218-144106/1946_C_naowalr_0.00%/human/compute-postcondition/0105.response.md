Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number inputted; `b` is an integer equal to the second number inputted; `adj[a]` now contains `b`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` and `b` are integers inputted earlier, the list `adj[a]` now includes the value of `b`. The initial values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
