Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**.

This means that the variable `x` has been assigned the value of `(L + R) // 2`, while the values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `R - L` must still be greater than 1.
