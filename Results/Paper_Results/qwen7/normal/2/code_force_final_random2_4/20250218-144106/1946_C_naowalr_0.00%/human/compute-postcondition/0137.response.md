Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is either 25001 or 50001, `R` is either 50002 or 25001, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is now (L + R) // 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. Since `L` can be either 25001 or 50001, and `R` can be either 50002 or 25001, the value of `x` will be either 37501 or 37501. However, since both possible values of `x` are the same, we can simply state that `x` is now (L + R) // 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
