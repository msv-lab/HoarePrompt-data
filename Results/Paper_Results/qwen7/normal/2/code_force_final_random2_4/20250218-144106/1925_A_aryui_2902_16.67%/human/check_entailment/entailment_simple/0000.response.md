Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
2. The proposed solution initializes a string `s` containing the first 20 lowercase English alphabets (`'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`) and then returns a string that is the concatenation of the substring of `s` from index 0 to `k-1` repeated `n` times.
3. This approach does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets will be subsequences of `s`. For example, if `n=2` and `k=3`, the string `s` would be `'abcabcabc...'`, but this does not contain all possible subsequences like `ac` or `bc`.
4. The correct approach should ensure that the constructed string `s` includes all required subsequences. One way to achieve this is by creating a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence that contains every possible subsequence of a given length over a specified alphabet.

Given the current implementation, it does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
