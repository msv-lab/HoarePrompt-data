Output State: **`s` is a new string input by the user, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or unchanged, `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be the same as before.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = 'SQUARE'` simply reassigns the value of `b` to 'SQUARE'. This does not affect the values of `s`, `a`, `j`, or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions except for the explicit reassignment of `b`.
