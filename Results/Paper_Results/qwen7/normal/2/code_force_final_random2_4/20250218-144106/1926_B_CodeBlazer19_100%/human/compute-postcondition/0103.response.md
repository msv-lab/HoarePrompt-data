Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a new string input by the user.
   - `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or unchanged.
   - `b` is 'SQUARE'.
   - `j` is `j + 1`.
   - `n` must be the same as before.
   - If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE', otherwise `a` is 'TRIANGLE'.
   - `b` is either 'SQUARE' or unchanged.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs for each value of `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration (`j = j + 1`), at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains unchanged because it is defined outside the loop.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged unless the loop body changes them, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they stay as they are.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `j` will be `j + 1` (since it was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `a` remains either 'TRIANGLE' or unchanged.
   - `b` remains 'SQUARE' or unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a new string input by the user, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or unchanged, `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be the same as before**.
