Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, `a` is 0 otherwise, `b` is an empty string if the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, `b` is either 'SQUARE' or remains unchanged if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, and `s` is an input string.
