Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0.
- `b` is 'SQUARE'.
- `j` is 3.
- `s` is the final input string from the user, and if the input string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` remains 'TRIANGLE'; otherwise, the conditions for `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.

The print statement is `print(a)`. To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the condition for `a`.

- If the input string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` remains 'TRIANGLE'.
- Otherwise, the conditions for `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged, meaning `a` could be either 'TRIANGLE' or 0.

Since the problem does not specify the exact input string `s`, we cannot definitively determine whether `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' or 0. However, based on the given conditions, `a` can only be one of these two values.

Output: **'TRIANGLE' or 0**
