Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is the last string input by the user.
- `a` is the string 'TRIANGLE'.
- `b` is the string 'SQUARE'.
- `j` is `n + 2`, where `n` is the same as the initial input.
- `i` is unchanged, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `a` is not 0, but this condition is irrelevant since `a` is a string, not a number.

The print statement is `print(b)`, which means it will print the string `b`.

Output: **SQUARE**
