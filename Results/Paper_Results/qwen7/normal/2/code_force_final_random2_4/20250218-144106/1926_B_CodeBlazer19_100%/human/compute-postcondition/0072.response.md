Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is 2, `s` is the input string from the user, and if the input string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` remains 'TRIANGLE'; if `s` does not contain more than one '1', the conditions for `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.
