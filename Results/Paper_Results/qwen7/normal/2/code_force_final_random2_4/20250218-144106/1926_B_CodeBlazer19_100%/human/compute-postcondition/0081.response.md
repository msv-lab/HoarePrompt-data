Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t)`. The only variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, and `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the new state of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if the loop is to continue, `i` must become `n + 2`.

4. **Determine the new state of `t`**: For the loop to continue, `t` must remain greater than 0. However, since no information suggests that `t` changes within the loop, `t` should remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the other states**: The other states (`a`, `b`, `j`, and `s`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition alone.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

**Final State**:
- `i` becomes `n + 2`
- `t` remains greater than 0 (no specific value given, just the condition)

So, the updated state is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is 3, `s` is the final input string from the user, and `a` remains 'TRIANGLE' regardless of whether the input string `s` contains exactly one '1' or not.**
