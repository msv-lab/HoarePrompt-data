Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n)`. The only variable here is `j`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values are as follows:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0
   - `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'
   - `j` is 0
   - The input string `s` from the user has exactly one '1' if `a` is 'TRIANGLE', otherwise `s` contains more than one '1'.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the only variable in the loop head, it needs to be adjusted.
   - Initially, `j` is 0. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1.

4. **Maintain Other States**: The other states (`t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `s`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `j` is 1, and the input string `s` from the user has exactly one '1' if `a` is 'TRIANGLE', otherwise `s` contains more than one '1'.**
