Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, and `s` is the final input string after all iterations, `n` is the new input integer from user input.**

The code snippet `b = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
