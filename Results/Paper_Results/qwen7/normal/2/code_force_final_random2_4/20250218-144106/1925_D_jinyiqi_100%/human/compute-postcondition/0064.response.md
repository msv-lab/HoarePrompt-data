Output State: All the iterations of the loop have been executed, meaning the variable `i` will take on all values from `0` to `t-1`. For each iteration, the following calculations are performed:

1. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are read from the input.
2. A sum `sum_f` is computed by iterating over `m` values of `f`.
3. The value of `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
4. The value of `p` is computed as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, then reduced by dividing by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).
5. The value of `q` is set to `2 * cn2`, also reduced by dividing by the same `gcd`.
6. The final result is printed as `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`.

The loop will continue until all `t` iterations are completed, with each iteration processing different inputs for `n`, `m`, and `k`, and computing the final output based on those values. The variables `t`, `M`, and any previously computed values outside the loop (like `gcd`, `cn2`, etc.) will retain their last computed or assigned values after the loop completes.
