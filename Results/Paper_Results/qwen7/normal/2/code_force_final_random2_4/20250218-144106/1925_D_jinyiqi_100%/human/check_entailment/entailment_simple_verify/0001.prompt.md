You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #State: Output State: All variables outside the loop remain unchanged, including `t`, `M`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd`. After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `t-1`, and the final values of `p` and `q` will be simplified by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`). The expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` will be printed for each iteration, resulting in `t` outputs, each representing the simplified fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) modulo \( M \).
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, the loop will have processed all inputs specified by `t`, and for each input set, it will compute and print the result of the expression \( \frac{p}{q} \mod M \), where `p` and `q` are the final values after all iterations, simplified by their greatest common divisor.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, pairs of friends, and the number of excursions respectively.
   - It also reads the pairs of friends and their friendship values.

2. **Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates the sum of all friendship values (`sum_f`).
   - It computes the total number of unique pairs of children (`cn2`), which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`.
   - The formula used to calculate the expected value is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \times k \times cn2 \times sum_f + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{2 \times cn2^2}
     \]
   - This formula seems to be derived from the problem statement but needs verification.

3. **Simplification and GCD Calculation:**
   - The numerator and denominator are simplified using the greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - The result is then converted to the required form \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

### Verification of the Formula:
The formula provided in the program:
\[
\text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \times k \times cn2 \times sum_f + m \times k \times (k - 1)}{2 \times cn2^2}
\]
needs to be verified against the problem statement.

- The term \(2 \times k \times cn2 \times sum_f\) accounts for the initial contribution of friendship values.
- The term \(m \times k \times (k - 1)\) accounts for the increase in friendship values due to repeated selections of friend pairs.
- The denominator \(2 \times cn2^2\) normalizes the expected value.

However, the problem statement suggests that the expected value should be calculated considering the probability of selecting each pair and the effect of increased friendship values. The provided formula might not fully capture these probabilities and effects.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify with the given example:

- **Test Case 2:**
  - \(n = 5\), \(m = 2\), \(k = 4\)
  - Pairs: (1, 2, 25) and (3, 2, 24)

  - Sum of friendship values: \(25 + 24 = 49\)
  - Total unique pairs: \(5 \times 4 / 2 = 10\)
  - Expected value calculation:
    \[
    \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \times 4 \times 10 \times 49 + 2 \times 4 \times (4 - 1)}{2 \times 10^2} = \frac{3920 + 24}{200} = \frac{3944}{200} = 19.72
    \]

  - The expected value should be an integer, and the provided formula does not seem to match the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The provided formula in the program does not accurately reflect the expected value as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
