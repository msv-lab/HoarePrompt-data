Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(m)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial States**:
   - `a` is an integer from the input.
   - `b` is an integer from the input.
   - `sum_f` is equal to `f` since `sum_f` was not initialized before and `f` is an integer from the input.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is some value (let's call it `j_prev`) and `m` is the same as it was before.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if the loop is to execute again, `j` must be `j_prev + 1`.
   - `m` remains unchanged unless there is an assignment inside the loop that changes its value, but based on the given information, it does not change.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `a` remains the same since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `b` remains the same since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `sum_f` remains the same since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `j_prev + 1`.
   - `m` remains the same as it was before.

Given that `j` was `j_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be `j_prev + 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `sum_f` is equal to `f` since `sum_f` was not initialized before and `f` is an integer from the input, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `m` is the same as it was before**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j_prev`, we can represent it as `j_prev` for clarity, but the key point is that `j` is incremented by 1.

So, the final state is:
State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `sum_f` is equal to `f` since `sum_f` was not initialized before and `f` is an integer from the input, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `m` is the same as it was before**.
