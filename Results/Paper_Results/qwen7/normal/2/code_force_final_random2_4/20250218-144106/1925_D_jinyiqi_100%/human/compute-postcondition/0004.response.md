Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `sum_f` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `sum_f` to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state since no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet.
