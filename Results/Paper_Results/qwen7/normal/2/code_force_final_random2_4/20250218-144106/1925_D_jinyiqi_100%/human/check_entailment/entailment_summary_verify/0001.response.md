### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the provided formula in the program does not accurately reflect the expected value as per the problem statement. Let's re-evaluate the problem and the program to confirm this conclusion.

#### Problem Restatement:
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. The expected value should be computed for each test case and returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following points:
1. **Probability of Choosing Each Pair**: Each pair is chosen equiprobably and independently for each excursion.
2. **Effect of Increased Friendship Values**: If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

Given these points, the expected value for each pair of friends can be calculated as follows:
- The probability of choosing a specific pair in any given excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
- The expected value contribution of a pair of friends in the first excursion is their initial friendship value.
- For each subsequent excursion, the expected value contribution of a pair of friends increases by 1.

Thus, the expected value for a pair of friends after k excursions can be derived as:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \left(\text{Initial Friendship Value} + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}\right) \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

Summing this up for all pairs of friends will give us the total expected value.

#### Correct Formula:
The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions is:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left(f_i + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}\right) \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

This formula takes into account the initial friendship values and the increase in values due to repeated selections.

#### Program Evaluation:
The provided program does not correctly implement this formula. Specifically:
- The formula used in the program does not account for the increase in friendship values due to repeated selections.
- The normalization factor \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) is missing in the program.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the expected value as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
