### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the sum of friendship values `sum_f` from the input pairs.
3. **Combination Calculation**: It calculates `cn2` which is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`.
4. **Incorrect Calculation of `p` and `q`**:
   - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
   - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`
5. **GCD Simplification**: It simplifies `p` and `q` using the greatest common divisor.
6. **Output**: It prints the result of `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` for each test case.

#### Corrected Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: Similar to the given program.
2. **Friends List**: It stores the pairs and their friendship values in a list `friends`.
3. **Combination Calculation**: Same as the given program.
4. **Correct Calculation of `p` and `q`**:
   - `p = sum(f * k for _, _, f in friends)`
   - `q = cn2`
5. **GCD Simplification**: Same as the given program.
6. **Output**: Same as the given program.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The assessment claims that the program incorrectly calculates `p` and `q` without considering the probability of choosing each pair of friends.

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment is accurate because:
- The given program calculates `p` and `q` incorrectly. It uses a formula that does not account for the probability of choosing each pair of friends.
- The corrected program provided in the assessment correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair of friends.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem, and the corrected program provided in the assessment does.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
