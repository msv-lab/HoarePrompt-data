Output State: **`j` is `j_prev + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `j_prev + 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`**.

In this case, the code `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by `f`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
