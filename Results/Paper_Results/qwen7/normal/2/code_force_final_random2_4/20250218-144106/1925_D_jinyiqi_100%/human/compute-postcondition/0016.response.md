Output State: **All iterations of the loop have completed, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `j` is `m-1`, `a` is an integer entered by the user for each iteration, `b` is an integer entered by the user for each iteration, `f` is an integer entered by the user for each iteration, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the `m` iterations, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `cn2` as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is the number of combinations of `n` items taken 2 at a time. This calculation does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `j`, `f`, `sum_f`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
