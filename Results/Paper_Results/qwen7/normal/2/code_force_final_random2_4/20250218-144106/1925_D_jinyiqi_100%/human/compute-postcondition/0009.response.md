Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `f` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. Since the actual values are not provided, we represent them as integers entered by the user. All other information from the initial state remains unchanged.
