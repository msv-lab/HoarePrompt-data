Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `q` is equal to 2 * `cn2`; `p` is `p` divided by `gcd`.**

Explanation: The code divides `p` by `gcd`, updating the value of `p` to its greatest common divisor with `q`. The value of `q` remains unchanged as it is equal to `2 * cn2`. The value of `gcd` also remains unchanged as it was already the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
