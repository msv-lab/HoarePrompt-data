Output State: **`cn2` is equal to `n * (n - 1) // 2`, all other variables (`a`, `b`, `f`, `j`, `sum_f`, `p`, `q`, `cn2`, `gcd`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`) retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code calculates `cn2` as `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This formula is used to compute the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items, which is also known as "n choose 2". The values of all other variables remain unchanged from their final values in the last loop iteration.
