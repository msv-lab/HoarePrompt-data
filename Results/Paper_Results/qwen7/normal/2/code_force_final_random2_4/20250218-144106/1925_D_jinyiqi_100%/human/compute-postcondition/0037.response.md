Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `-1`, `sum_f` is the total sum of all integers `f` entered by the user, and all other variables (`a`, `b`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, `k`, `i`, `m`) retain their values from the final iteration or remain unchanged.**

In Natural Language: After executing the code, the value of `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`. The variable `j` is set to `-1`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `sum_f` contains the total sum of all integers `f` entered by the user during the loop iterations. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, `k`, `i`, `m`) retain their values from the last iteration or remain unchanged.
