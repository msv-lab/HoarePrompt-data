Output State: **`sum_f` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `j` is `m-1`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `p` is updated to `p // gcd`, `q` is updated to `q // gcd`**

Explanation: The line `sum_f = 0` initializes `sum_f` to 0. All other variables retain their initial states as specified in the precondition.
