Output State: **`a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, `f` is the third integer entered by the user, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`, `j` is `j + 2`, `m` is the same as before**.

This means that the values of `a`, `b`, `f`, `sum_f`, `j`, and `m` have been updated. Specifically, `a`, `b`, and `f` now hold the integers entered by the user. `sum_f` is updated to include the value of `f`. `j` is incremented by 2. The values of `m` and the initial state of `j` remain unchanged.
