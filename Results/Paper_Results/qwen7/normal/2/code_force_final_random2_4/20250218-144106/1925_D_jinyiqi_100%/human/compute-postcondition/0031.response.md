Output State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`, `j` is `j + 1`, `m` is the same as before, `a` is updated to the first integer entered by the user, `b` is updated to the second integer entered by the user, `f` is updated to the third integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `sum_f += f` updates the value of `sum_f` by adding the current value of `f` to it. The values of `a`, `b`, `j`, `m`, and `f` are updated according to the initial state description.
