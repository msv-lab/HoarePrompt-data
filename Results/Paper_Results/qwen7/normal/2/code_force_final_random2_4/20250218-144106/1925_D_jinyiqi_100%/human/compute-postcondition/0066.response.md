Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4), followed by integers n, m, and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5). Additionally, it processes m lines of input containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i (a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9) representing pairs of friends and their associated values. The function returns different outputs based on the processed data for each test case.**

This means the function handles a series of test cases, each with specific constraints on the values of t, n, m, and k, along with additional data points (a_i, b_i, f_i). The exact nature of the return value isn't specified in the problem statement, so the functionality focuses on processing the given inputs according to the described constraints.
