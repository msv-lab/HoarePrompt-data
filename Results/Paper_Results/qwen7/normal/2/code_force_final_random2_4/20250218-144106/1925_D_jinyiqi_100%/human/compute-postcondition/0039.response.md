Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is -1, `sum_f` is the total sum of all integers `f` entered by the user, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`, and all other variables (`a`, `b`, `gcd`, `k`, `i`, `m`) retain their values from the final iteration or remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `q` is assigned the value `2 * cn2 ** 2`. Given that `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, the new value of `q` becomes `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`. All other variables (`cn2`, `j`, `sum_f`, `p`, `a`, `b`, `gcd`, `k`, `i`, `m`) retain their previous values.
