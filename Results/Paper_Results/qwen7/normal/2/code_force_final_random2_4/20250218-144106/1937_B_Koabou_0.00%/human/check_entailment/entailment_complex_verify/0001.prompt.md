You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are provided, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `a` is a list with two elements: the first element is the original element from the initial state, and the second element is the input from the user entered during the third iteration of the loop.
    s = []

            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is 2, `s` is a string slice from `a[0]` from index 0 to index 3 (inclusive) concatenated with a slice from `a[1]` starting from index 2, and `n` is at least 4.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and two binary strings \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \). For each test case, it finds a substring in \( a_1 \) that matches a prefix in \( a_2 \) and returns the length of the longest matching prefix. If no match is found, it returns 1. The function prints the matched substring and the length of the longest matching prefix.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Grid Input**: For each test case, it correctly reads the dimensions `n` and the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid.
3. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Path**:
   - The program checks if there's a point where the top row has a '1' and the bottom row has a '0'. If such a point exists, it constructs the lexicographically smallest path up to that point and continues from the bottom row.
   - If no such point exists, it simply appends the last character of the bottom row to the top row.
4. **Counting Paths**:
   - After constructing the lexicographically smallest path, the program counts the number of identical prefixes between the constructed path and the top row.
   - This count gives the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program appears to handle all cases correctly. However, let's verify the logic with a few more test cases to ensure correctness.

Correctness: **True**

Here is a brief verification using the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = ['00', '00']`
  - Lexicographically smallest path: `000`
  - Number of paths: 2

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 4`, `a = ['1101', '1100']`
  - Lexicographically smallest path: `11000`
  - Number of paths: 1

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 8`, `a = ['00100111', '11101101']`
  - Lexicographically smallest path: `001001101`
  - Number of paths: 4

The program handles these cases correctly, so the final answer is:

Correctness: **True**
