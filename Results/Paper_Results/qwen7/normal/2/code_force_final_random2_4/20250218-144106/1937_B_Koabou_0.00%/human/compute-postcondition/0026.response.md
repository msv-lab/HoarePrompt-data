Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` is 1 (though `x` is not part of the loop head, we will keep it as given)
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - The first element of `a` at index 0 has its second element equal to '01'
   - The first element of `a` at index 1 has its 0-th element equal to '0'

3. **Loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1, let's assume `n` is at least 3 (the smallest value that allows the loop to run at least once).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Increase `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - Ensure `n` remains greater than 1 (since `n` was greater than 1 initially, it can remain the same or increase, but we don't know the exact value, so we just ensure it's still valid).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `x` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
