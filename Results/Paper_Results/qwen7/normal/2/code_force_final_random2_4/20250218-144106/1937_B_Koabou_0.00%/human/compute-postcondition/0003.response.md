Output State: **`a` is a list with one additional element which is the input from the user.**

The code `a.append(input())` appends the input from the user to the list `a`. Since no initial values for `a` were provided, we assume `a` is an empty list before the code execution. After executing the code, `a` will contain one more element, which is the string input provided by the user.
