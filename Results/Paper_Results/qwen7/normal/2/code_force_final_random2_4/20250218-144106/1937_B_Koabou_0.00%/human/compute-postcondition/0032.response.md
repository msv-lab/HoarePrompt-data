Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is 2, `s` is a string slice from `a[0]` from index 0 to index 3 (inclusive) concatenated with a slice from `a[1]` starting from index 2, and `n` is at least 4.**

Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop runs three times, and each time it updates `i` and `x` to 2. The variable `s` is set to a specific concatenation of slices from `a[0]` and `a[1]` when the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met. Since the loop runs exactly three times and `i` reaches 2, the final value of `i` and `x` will be 2. The value of `n` must be at least 4 because the loop iterates up to `n-1`, and `i` reaches 2, meaning the loop must have at least 3 iterations, so `n` must be at least 4.
