Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, the first element of `a` at index 0 has its second element equal to '01', and the first element of `a` at index 1 has its 0-th element equal to '0'. If the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
