You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are provided, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `a` is a list with two elements: the first element is the original element from the initial state, and the second element is the input from the user entered during the third iteration of the loop.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is 2, `s` is a string slice from `a[0]` from index 0 to index 3 (inclusive) concatenated with a slice from `a[1]` starting from index 2, and `n` is at least 4.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: i is 5, x is 5, s is 'aaa2', t is 1.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: aaa2
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings a_1 and a_2 of length n, where each character in the strings is either '0' or '1'. It returns a result based on the comparison of the two binary strings for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
