Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. The program attempts to construct the string by merging the two rows under certain conditions, but it does not always produce the correct result.

Consider the following test case:
```
3
2
01
10
```

The expected output for this case should be:
```
00
2
```

However, the program will produce:
```
01
1
```

This happens because the program checks for a specific condition (`a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`) to decide how to merge the rows, which does not cover all possible scenarios to achieve the lexicographically smallest string. In this case, the correct approach would be to always take the minimum value at each step, which the current implementation does not do.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case.
