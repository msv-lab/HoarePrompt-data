Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` must be greater than 4, `t` is `x - 4 + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `x`, and `t`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
