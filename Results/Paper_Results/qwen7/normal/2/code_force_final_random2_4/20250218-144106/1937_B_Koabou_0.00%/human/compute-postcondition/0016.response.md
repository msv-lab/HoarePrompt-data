Output State: **`i` is 0; `x` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; the first element of `a` at index 0 has its second element equal to '0'; the first element of `a` at index 1 has its 0-th element equal to '0'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `x`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
