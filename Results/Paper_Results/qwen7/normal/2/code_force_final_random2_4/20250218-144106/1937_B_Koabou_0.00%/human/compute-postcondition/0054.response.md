Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings a_1 and a_2 of length n, where each character in the strings is either '0' or '1'. It returns a result based on the comparison of the two binary strings for each test case.**

Note: The actual logic to compare the binary strings and generate the result is not described here as per the instruction.
