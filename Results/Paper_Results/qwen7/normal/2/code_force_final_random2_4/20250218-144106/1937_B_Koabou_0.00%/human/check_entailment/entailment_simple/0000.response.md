Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function reads the dimensions \( n \) and the two binary strings from the input.
   - It then iterates through the strings to find the lexicographically smallest path.
   - However, the logic within the function is flawed:
     - The variable `s` is constructed by concatenating parts of `a[0]` and `a[1]` under a specific condition.
     - The variable `t` is set based on whether the prefix of `a[0]` matches the prefix of `s`.
     - The function prints `s` and `t`, but these values do not correctly represent the lexicographically smallest path or the count of such paths.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest path, we need to ensure that the path taken respects the constraints of moving right or down and results in the smallest possible binary string.
   - The function should consider all possible paths and determine the smallest one and its count.

3. **Given Code Flaws**:
   - The code does not correctly handle all possible paths.
   - The construction of `s` and the value of `t` are not aligned with the problem requirements.
   - The function does not account for all possible paths leading to the lexicographically smallest string.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to compute the lexicographically smallest path and the count of such paths accurately.

Correctness: **False**
