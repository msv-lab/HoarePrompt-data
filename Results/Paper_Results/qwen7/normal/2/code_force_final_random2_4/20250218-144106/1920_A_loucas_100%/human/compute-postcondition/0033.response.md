Output State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is an input integer, `big` now contains this integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
