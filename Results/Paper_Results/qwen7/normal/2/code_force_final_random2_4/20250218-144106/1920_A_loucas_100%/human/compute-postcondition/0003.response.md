Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is an input integer, `iterable` must be within the range defined by `loop` (i.e., 0 ≤ iterable < loop), `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `big`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `loop`, `iterable`, or `less`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
