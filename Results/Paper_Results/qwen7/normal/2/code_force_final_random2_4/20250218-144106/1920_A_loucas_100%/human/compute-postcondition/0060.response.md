Postcondition: `i` is the next element in the list `no`, `no` must contain at least one element, `less` is a list with a minimum value, `big` is a list with a maximum value, and `num` is decremented by 1. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` remains `num - 1`.
