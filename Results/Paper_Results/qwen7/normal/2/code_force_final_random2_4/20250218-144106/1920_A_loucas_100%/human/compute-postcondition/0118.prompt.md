Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is equal to `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2 during the loop iterations, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1 during the loop iterations, `no` contains all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2 during the loop iterations, the variable `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, the variable `x` is the last value read from the loop and it is not 1 or 2, the variable `a` is the last value read from the loop and it is not in `less` or `big`, and the current value of `num` is either greater than or equal to 1, or `num` is less than 1 and `x` is not 1 or 2 and `a` is not in `less` or `big`.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num` is equal to `min(less) - max(big) - 1`, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2 during the loop iterations, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1 during the loop iterations, `no` must contain at least one integer, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `x` is the last value read from the loop and it is not 1 or 2, `a` is the last value read from the loop and it is not in `less` or `big`, and the current value of `num` is either greater than or equal to 0, or `num` is less than 0 and `x` is not 1 or 2 and `a` is not in `less` or `big`. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to `min(less)` and greater than or equal to `max(big)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `num` is the value of its original value minus 1. This holds true if `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the original value of `i` minus 2, `num` is the original value of `num` minus 2, `less` and `big` remain the same, if `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
