Output State: **`num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `no` is a list containing all values of `a` that were not 1 or 2, `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where the corresponding `x` was 2, and `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where the corresponding `x` was 1. The value of `num` is less than 1 and we continue the loop or iteration we were in.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only moves the control flow to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `num`, `no`, `less`, and `big` remain unchanged, and the condition that `num` is less than 1 also remains true.
