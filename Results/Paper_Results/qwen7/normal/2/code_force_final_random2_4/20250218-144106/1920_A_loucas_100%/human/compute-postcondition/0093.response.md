Output State: **`less` is a list with `a` appended, `num` is an integer, `big` is a list, `no` is a list, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `iterable2` is incremented by 1, `innerLoop` remains the same**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `less`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
