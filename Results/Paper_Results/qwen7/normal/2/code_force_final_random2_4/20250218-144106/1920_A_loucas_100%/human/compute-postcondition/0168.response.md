Output State: **`no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2, `i` is a value that is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, `num` is decreased by 1.**

This means that the value of `num` has been decreased by 1, while the conditions for the lists `no` and the value of `i` remain unchanged from the initial state.
