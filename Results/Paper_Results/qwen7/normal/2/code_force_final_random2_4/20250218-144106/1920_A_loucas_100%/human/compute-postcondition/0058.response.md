Output State: **`i` is the next element in the list `no`, `no` must contain at least one element, `less` is a list with a minimum value, `big` is a list with a maximum value, and `num` is decremented by 1, so `num` is now `num - 1`.**

The code `num -= 1` decrements the value of `num` by 1. All other variables (`i`, `no`, `less`, `big`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
