Postcondition: **`num` is equal to `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2 during the loop iterations, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1 during the loop iterations, `no` contains all integers `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2 during the loop iterations, the variable `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, the variable `x` is the last value read from the loop and it is not 1 or 2, the variable `a` is the last value read from the loop and it is not in `less` or `big`, and the current value of `num` is less than 1.**
