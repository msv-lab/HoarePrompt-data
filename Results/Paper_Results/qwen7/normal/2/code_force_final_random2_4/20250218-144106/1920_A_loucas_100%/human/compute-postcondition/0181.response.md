Output State: **The list `no` is empty, and `num` is less than or equal to its initial value minus the number of times the loop executed.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the list `no` will be empty because each element that satisfied the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)` would have caused `num` to be decremented. Since the loop continues as long as `num` is greater than 0, once `num` reaches 0 or below, the loop stops. Therefore, `no` will be empty, and `num` will be reduced by the number of times the condition was met during the loop's execution.
