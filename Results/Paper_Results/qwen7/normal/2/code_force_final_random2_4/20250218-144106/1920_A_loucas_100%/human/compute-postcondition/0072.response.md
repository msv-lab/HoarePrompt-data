Output State: **`less` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `big` is [a], `no` is an empty list, `x` is 1**

Explanation: The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` (which is an input integer) to the list `big`. The other variables (`less`, `num`, `no`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `big` now contains the value of `a` in a list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
