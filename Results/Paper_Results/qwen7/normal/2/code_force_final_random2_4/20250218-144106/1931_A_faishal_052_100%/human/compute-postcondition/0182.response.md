Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is an empty string.**

The code `temp = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `temp`. This overwrites the previous value of `temp`, which was a concatenation of characters derived from `info`. All other variables (`i`, `j`, and `cases`) remain unchanged.
