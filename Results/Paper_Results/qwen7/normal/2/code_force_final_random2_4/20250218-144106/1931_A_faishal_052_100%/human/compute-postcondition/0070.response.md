Postcondition: `lex` is an integer with a value greater than or equal to 28. If `lex` is less than 52, then `arr` is a list containing the element 26. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, then if `lex` is less than or equal to 78, `arr` remains a list containing the element 26. If `lex` is greater than 78, the value of `lex` and the state of `arr` remain unchanged.
