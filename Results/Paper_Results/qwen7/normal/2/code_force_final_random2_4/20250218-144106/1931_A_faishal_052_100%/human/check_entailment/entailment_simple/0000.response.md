Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing `arr`:**
   - The program attempts to construct `arr` based on the value of `lex` using conditions that do not accurately represent the encoding process. Specifically, the conditions `if lex < 28:` and `elif lex < 52:` are incorrect for constructing the word. These conditions do not reflect the actual encoding logic where the sum of the positions of the characters is calculated.

2. **Sorting and Appending `lex`:**
   - The program sorts `arr` and appends `lex` to it, which is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem at hand. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest word, not to sort the indices and then map them back to characters.

3. **Character Mapping:**
   - The program uses `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` to map the indices back to characters, which is correct, but the indices themselves are incorrectly constructed.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Determine the possible characters for each position in the word based on the sum `n`.
- Ensure that the word is lexicographically smallest by starting with the smallest possible characters.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        result = ['a', 'a', 'a']
        for i in range(2, -1, -1):
            if n >= 27:
                result[i] = chr(ord(result[i]) + 1)
                n -= 26
        print(''.join(result))

# Example usage
func()
```

Explanation:
- We initialize `result` as `['a', 'a', 'a']` to start with the smallest possible word.
- We iterate from the end of the word (last character) to the beginning, decrementing `n` by 26 each time we encounter a character that can be incremented.
- This ensures that we always use the smallest possible character that fits within the remaining sum `n`.

Given the above corrections, the original annotated program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
