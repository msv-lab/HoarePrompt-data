Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly decode the encoded values into the lexicographically smallest word. Let's break down why:

1. **Logic Error**: The logic used to determine the character positions (`arr`) is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that the first two characters can only be 'a' or 'z', which is not always the case.
2. **Incorrect Decoding**: The code does not handle the general case where the sum `lex` can be split into three valid character positions. Instead, it tries to force the first two characters to be 'a' or 'z', which is not always possible or optimal.
3. **Sorting Logic**: Sorting the array `arr` before converting it to characters does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.

To correctly solve this problem, you should:
- Iterate through possible values for the first character.
- For each possible value of the first character, iterate through possible values for the second character.
- Calculate the remaining value for the third character and check if it is a valid character position.
- Track the lexicographically smallest word found during this process.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        min_word = 'zzz'
        for i in range(1, 27):  # First character
            for j in range(1, 27):  # Second character
                k = lex - i - j
                if 1 <= k <= 26:  # Third character must be a valid position
                    word = chr(i + 96) + chr(j + 96) + chr(k + 96)
                    if word < min_word:
                        min_word = word
        print(min_word)

func()
```

This version iterates over all possible combinations of the first two characters and calculates the third character. It ensures that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest by comparing with the current minimum word found.
