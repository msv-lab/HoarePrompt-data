Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all iterations depends on the initial value of `lex`.**

Given the conditions inside the loop, each iteration of the loop reduces `lex` by either 1 or 26 until `lex` is no longer less than or equal to 78. Since the loop runs for a fixed number of times (3 times based on the provided information), we can deduce the final state of `lex` and `arr`.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

1. **If `lex` is initially less than 28:**
   - The loop will append 1 to `arr` once and reduce `lex` by 1.
   - If `lex` is still less than 28 after the first iteration, it will continue appending 1 and reducing `lex` by 1.
   - After 3 iterations, `lex` will be reduced by 3, so `lex` will be `lex - 3`.
   - `arr` will contain `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` was initially less than 28 and reduced to a value less than 28 after 3 iterations.

2. **If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive):**
   - The loop will append 26 to `arr` once and reduce `lex` by 26.
   - If `lex` is still between 28 and 51 after the first iteration, it will continue appending 26 and reducing `lex` by 26.
   - After 3 iterations, `lex` will be reduced by 78, so `lex` will be `lex - 78`.
   - `arr` will contain `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex` was initially between 28 and 51 and reduced to a value less than 28 after 3 iterations.

3. **If `lex` is between 52 and 77 (inclusive):**
   - The loop will append 26 to `arr` once and reduce `lex` by 26.
   - If `lex` is still between 52 and 77 after the first iteration, it will continue appending 26 and reducing `lex` by 26.
   - After 3 iterations, `lex` will be reduced by 78, so `lex` will be `lex - 78`.
   - `arr` will contain `[26, 26, 26]` if `lex` was initially between 52 and 77 and reduced to a value less than 28 after 3 iterations.

4. **If `lex` is greater than 78:**
   - The loop will not change the value of `lex` or modify `arr` since the condition `lex <= 78` is not met.
   - `arr` will remain unchanged, and `lex` will remain the same.

In summary, after all iterations of the loop, `arr` will contain a list of 3 elements, each being either 1, 26, or unchanged, depending on the initial value of `lex`. `lex` will be reduced by a multiple of 1 or 26, up to a maximum reduction of 78, and will be an integer.
