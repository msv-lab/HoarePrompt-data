Output State: **`j` is 2; `lex` is either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26`; `arr` contains the elements 26 and 1.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contained the element 26. After appending 1, `arr` now contains the elements 26 and 1. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
