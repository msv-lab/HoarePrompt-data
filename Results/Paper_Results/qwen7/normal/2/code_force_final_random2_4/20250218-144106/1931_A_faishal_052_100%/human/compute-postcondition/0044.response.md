Postcondition: `j` is 1, `lex` is either less than 26 or between -26 and 26 (inclusive), and `arr` contains the elements 26, 26, 26. If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, then `lex` remains unchanged and `arr` still contains the elements 26, 26, 26. If `lex` is greater than 78, then `lex` remains unchanged and `arr` still contains the elements 26, 26, 26.
