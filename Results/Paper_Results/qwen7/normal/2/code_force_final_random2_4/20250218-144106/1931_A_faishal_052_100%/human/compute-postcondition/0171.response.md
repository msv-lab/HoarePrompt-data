Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is an empty string**.

The code `temp = ''` initializes `temp` as an empty string. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `j`, `cases`, or the content of `temp` except setting `temp` to an empty string. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.
