Output State: **`j` is 0, `lex` is between 28 and 78 (exclusive), `arr` contains the element 26, `lex` is now `lex - 26`.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was originally between 28 and 78 (inclusive), after subtracting 26, `lex` will now be between 2 and 52 (inclusive). The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
