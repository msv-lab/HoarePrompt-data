Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `arr` will contain the elements `[1, 26, 26, lex - 2]` or `[1, 26, 26, lex - 27]`, depending on the value of `lex` after the last iteration, and `arr` will be sorted in ascending order. `info` will be a list containing the final state of `arr` after sorting for each iteration.

This means that for each case (`i` in `range(cases)`), the loop constructs an array `arr` based on the value of `lex`, appends `lex` to `arr`, sorts `arr`, and then adds it to the `info` list. After all cases have been processed, `info` will contain a list of lists, where each inner list represents the final state of `arr` for each respective case, sorted in ascending order.
