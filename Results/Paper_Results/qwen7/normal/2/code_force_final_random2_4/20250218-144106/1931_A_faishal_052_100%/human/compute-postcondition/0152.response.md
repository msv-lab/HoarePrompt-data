Output State: **The loop executes 3 times in total, with `j` being 2. `lex` is either `lex - 2` or `lex - 27`. The list `arr` contains the elements [26, 26, 1] or [26, 26, 26].**

Explanation: After the loop executes 3 times, `j` will be 2 because the loop runs twice based on the given conditions. Depending on the value of `lex`, it will either decrease by 1 or 26 each time the loop runs. Specifically:
- If `lex` was less than 28 initially, it will have decreased by 2 (either 1 from the first iteration and 1 from the second, or 26 from the second and 1 from the third).
- If `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive) initially, it will have decreased by 26 twice and possibly 1 once, resulting in `lex` being `lex - 27`.
- The list `arr` will contain the elements appended during the loop, which can be either [26, 26, 1] or [26, 26, 26], depending on whether `lex` was less than 28 or between 28 and 52 initially.
