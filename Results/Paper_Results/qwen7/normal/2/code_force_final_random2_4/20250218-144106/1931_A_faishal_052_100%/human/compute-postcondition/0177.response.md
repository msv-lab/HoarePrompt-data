Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is equal to `chr(info[0][0] + 96) + chr(info[0][2] + 96) + chr(info[0][3] + 96)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `temp` by adding `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` to it. Initially, `temp` is set to `chr(info[0][0] + 96) + chr(info[0][2] + 96)`. After executing the line `temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)`, since `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, `temp` becomes `chr(info[0][0] + 96) + chr(info[0][2] + 96) + chr(info[0][3] + 96)`. The values of `i`, `j`, `cases`, and the original value of `temp` remain unchanged.
