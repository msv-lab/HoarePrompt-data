State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is an empty string, `j` must be less than 3** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `j` which is used in the `range` function.
2. For the loop to execute, `j` must satisfy the condition `j < 3`.
3. The initial value of `j` is 0, which satisfies the condition `j < 3`.
4. The other variables (`i`, `cases`, and `temp`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `j` is less than 3.
