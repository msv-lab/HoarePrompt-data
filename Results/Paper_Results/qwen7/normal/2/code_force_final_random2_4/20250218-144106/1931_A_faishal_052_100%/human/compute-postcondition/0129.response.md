Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is an integer, `arr` contains the element 26, and `lex` remains unchanged if it is less than 52.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr.append(26)` appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`. This operation does not affect the values of `j` or `lex`. Therefore, the value of `j` remains 1, `lex` remains unchanged (as per the initial conditions), and `arr` now contains the element 26.
