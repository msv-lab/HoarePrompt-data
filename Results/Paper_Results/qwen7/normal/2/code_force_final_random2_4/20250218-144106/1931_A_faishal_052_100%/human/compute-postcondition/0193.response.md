Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer n where 3 <= n <= 78, given that for each test case, t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**

This means the function does not take any external parameters but operates within a specific range for the integer `n`, which is between 3 and 78 inclusive.
