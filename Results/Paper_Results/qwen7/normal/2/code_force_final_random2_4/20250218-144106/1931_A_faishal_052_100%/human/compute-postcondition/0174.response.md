Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(3):`. This means `j` is the loop variable.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is 0
   - `cases` must be a positive integer
   - `temp` is equal to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`
   - `j` is less than 3

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `j < 3`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `j` is incremented to 1.
   - `cases` remains a positive integer.
   - `temp` remains equal to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`.
   - The condition `j < 3` must still hold true, which it does since `j` is now 1 and less than 3.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is equal to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`, `j` is less than 3**
