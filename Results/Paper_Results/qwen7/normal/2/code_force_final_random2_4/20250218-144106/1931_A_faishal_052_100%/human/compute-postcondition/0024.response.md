Output State: **`j` is 1; `lex` is either less than 52 or between 28 and 78 (inclusive); `arr` contains the elements 26 and 1.**

The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the element `26`. After executing the code, `arr` now contains both `26` and `1`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
