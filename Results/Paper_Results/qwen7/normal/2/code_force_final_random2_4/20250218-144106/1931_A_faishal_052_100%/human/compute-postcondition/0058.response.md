Output State: **`lex` is an integer less than 28, `arr` is a list containing the element 1**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `arr`. Since `lex` is unaffected by this operation, its value remains an integer less than 28. The list `arr` now contains at least one element, which is 1.
