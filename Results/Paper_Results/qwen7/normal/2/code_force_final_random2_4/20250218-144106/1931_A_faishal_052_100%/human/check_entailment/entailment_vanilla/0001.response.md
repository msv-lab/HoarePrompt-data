Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - It then reads `cases` lines, each containing an integer `lex`, which is the encoded value.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `lex` into a three-letter word.
   - It uses a list `arr` to store the decoded values of the letters.
   - The logic for decoding seems flawed and does not correctly handle the range of possible values for `lex`.

3. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The program checks if `lex` is less than 28, 52, or 78, which is incorrect for the given problem constraints.
   - If `lex` is less than 28, it incorrectly appends 1 and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is less than 52, it incorrectly appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it again incorrectly appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - Finally, it appends the remaining value to `arr` and sorts `arr`.

4. **Sorting and Output:**
   - The program sorts the list `arr` and converts each element to the corresponding character using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` and concatenates them to form the word.

### Correctness Check

Given the flawed logic in the decoding process, let's consider the correct approach:

1. **Correct Decoding:**
   - For a three-letter word `abc`, the encoded value is `a + b + c`.
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start with the smallest possible values for `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Revised Logic:**
   - Start with `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `c = 1`.
   - Increment `c` until the sum reaches the given encoded value.
   - If `c` exceeds 26, reset `c` to 1 and increment `b`.
   - If `b` exceeds 26, reset `b` to 1 and increment `a`.

### Revised Program

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        a, b, c = 1, 1, 1
        while a + b + c < lex:
            if c < 26:
                c += 1
            else:
                c = 1
                if b < 26:
                    b += 1
                else:
                    b = 1
                    a += 1
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has a flawed decoding logic and does not correctly produce the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
