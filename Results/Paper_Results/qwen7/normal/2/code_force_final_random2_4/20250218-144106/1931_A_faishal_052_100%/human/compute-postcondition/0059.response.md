Output State: **`lex` is an integer less than 27, `arr` is a list containing the element 1**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. Since `lex` was initially an integer less than 28, after decrementing by 1, it becomes an integer less than 27. The value of `arr` remains unchanged as the code only affects `lex`.
