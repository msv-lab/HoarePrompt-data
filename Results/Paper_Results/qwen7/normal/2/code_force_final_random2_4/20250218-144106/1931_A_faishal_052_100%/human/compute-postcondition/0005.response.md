Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(2)`. The objects involved here are `j`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: Since `j` is being initialized within the loop, its initial value before entering the loop is irrelevant. However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute.

3. **Check the range condition**: The loop `for j in range(2)` will execute if `j` is in the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive). This means `j` must be less than 2.

4. **Adjust the state**: Given that `j` is being initialized within the loop, the only state we need to ensure is that the loop can start. This means `j` should be in the valid range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `j` is in the range that allows the loop to execute.

**State: **`j` must be less than 2**
