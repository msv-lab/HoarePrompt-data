Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(3):`. The only variable here is `j`.

2. **Determine the current state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 3.

4. **Adjust the state of `j`**: Since `j` is currently 2, it needs to be incremented to 3 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Check other variables**: The variables `i`, `cases`, and `temp` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is equal to `chr(info[0][0] + 96) + chr(info[0][2] + 96)`**
