Output State: **`j` is 2; `lex` is either `lex - 2` or `lex - 27`; `arr` contains the elements 26 and 1.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. Since `lex` was either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26`, after decrementing by 1, it becomes either `lex - 2` or `lex - 27`. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
