Output State: **`j` is 1; `lex` is either less than 51 or between -27 and 51 (inclusive); `arr` contains the elements 26, 26, and 1.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. Since `lex` was either less than 52 or between -26 and 52 (inclusive), after decrementing by 1, `lex` will now be either less than 51 or between -27 and 51 (inclusive). The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
