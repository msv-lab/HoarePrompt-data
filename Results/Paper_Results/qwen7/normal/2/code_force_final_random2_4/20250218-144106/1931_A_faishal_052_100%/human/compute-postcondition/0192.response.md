Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[2][3] + 96)` repeated three times, and `info` contains a list of lists where each inner list represents the final state of `arr` after sorting for each respective case.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be 2 because the loop runs for `j` in `range(3)`, and `i` starts from 0, so it increments by 1 for each iteration of `j`. Since `j` ranges from 0 to 2, `i` will be 2 after the loop completes. `j` will be 3 because the loop condition is `j < 3`, and after the loop, `j` will be incremented one more time. `cases` remains a positive integer as it is not modified within the loop. `temp` will be a string containing the character corresponding to `info[2][3] + 96` repeated three times, as the loop appends this character to `temp` in each iteration of `j`. Finally, `info` will contain a list of lists, where each inner list represents the final state of `arr` after sorting for each respective case, sorted in ascending order.
