Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[2][3] + 96)`, `j` must be less than 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `temp` by concatenating it with the character obtained from `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, so `temp` is updated to include the character corresponding to `chr(info[2][3] + 96)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
