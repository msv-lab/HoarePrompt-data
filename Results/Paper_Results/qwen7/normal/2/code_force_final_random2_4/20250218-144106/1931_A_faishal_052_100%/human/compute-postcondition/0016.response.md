Output State: **`j` must be less than 2, `lex` is between 2 and 52, and `arr` contains the element 26**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was originally between 28 and 78, subtracting 26 from it results in a new range of 2 to 52. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
