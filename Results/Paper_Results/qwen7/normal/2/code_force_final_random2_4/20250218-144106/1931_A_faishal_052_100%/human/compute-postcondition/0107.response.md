Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 0 (since `range(2)` generates values from 0 to 1).

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. Since `j` starts at 0, it will execute twice (for `j = 0` and `j = 1`).

4. **Adjust the states of the objects in the loop head**: We need to ensure that `j` is set to its initial value before the loop starts executing.

Given the initial states:
- `arr` is no longer sorted in ascending order.
- `info` contains a list which is a copy of the original `arr`.
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- `lex` is an input integer.

Since the loop head only involves `j`, we only need to adjust the state of `j`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 0**
