Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list with 'no' appended, and either 'no' or 'yes' appended, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user. If the string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11', then the function appends 'yes' to `results`. Otherwise, the function appends 'no' to `results`**.
