Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `results`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
