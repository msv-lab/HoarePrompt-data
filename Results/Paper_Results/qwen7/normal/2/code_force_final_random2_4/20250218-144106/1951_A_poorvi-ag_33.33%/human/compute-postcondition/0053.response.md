The only variables in the loop head are `r` and `results`. Therefore, we can only adjust those variables.

At the end of the previous iteration, we do not have specific values for `r` or any conditions related to `results`. However, we know that the loop continues as long as there are elements left in `results`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure that `results` still contains at least one element. If `results` does not contain any elements, the loop would terminate.

Since we do not have specific values for `r` from the previous iteration, we can only focus on the condition for the loop to continue. The loop will continue if `results` is not empty.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `results` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`results` must contain at least one element**
