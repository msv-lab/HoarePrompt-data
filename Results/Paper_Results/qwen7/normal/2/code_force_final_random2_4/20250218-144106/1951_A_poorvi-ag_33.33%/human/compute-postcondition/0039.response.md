Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list with 'no', 'no', and the string input by the user appended, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, `arr` is reassigned to the new input string.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input()` takes a new string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The previous value of `arr` (which was the string input by the user) is now replaced with the new input string. All other variables remain unchanged.
