Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start` is an integer (not relevant to the loop)
   - `end` is an integer (not relevant to the loop)
   - `t` is an input integer
   - `results` is a list (not directly relevant to the loop)
   - `i` is either 0 or 1 (at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was either 0 or 1)
   - `n` is an input integer (unchanged)
   - `arr` is a string from input (unchanged)

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 or 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, if `i` was 0, it will become 1, and if `i` was 1, it will exceed `t` and the loop will terminate.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `arr` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state based on the loop head variables**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - If `i` was 0, it becomes 1.
   - If `i` was 1, the loop terminates.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i`.

**State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is a string from input.
