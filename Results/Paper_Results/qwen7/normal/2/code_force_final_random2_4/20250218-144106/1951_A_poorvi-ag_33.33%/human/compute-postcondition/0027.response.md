Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is a string from input, `n` is the integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
