The only objects in the loop head are the variables `r` and `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least two elements because the first element has already been processed in the previous iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two elements. Additionally, `r` will be set to the second element in the list.

State: **`results` must contain at least two elements, `r` is the second element in the list**
