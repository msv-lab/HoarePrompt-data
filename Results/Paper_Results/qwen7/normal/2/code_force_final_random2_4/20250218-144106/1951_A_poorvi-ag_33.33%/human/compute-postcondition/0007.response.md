Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list containing 'no', `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string from input. The count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2, and the substring '11' exists in `arr`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('no')` appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
