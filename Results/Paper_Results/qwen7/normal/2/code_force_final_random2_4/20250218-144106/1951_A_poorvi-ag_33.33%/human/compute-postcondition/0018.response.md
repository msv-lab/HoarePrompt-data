Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list, `i` is an integer, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is a string from input. If the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2 and the substring '11' exists in `arr`, then `results` is a list containing 'no', 'no', `i` is 1, and `n` is unchanged. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing 'yes', `i` is 0, and `arr` remains the same string.
