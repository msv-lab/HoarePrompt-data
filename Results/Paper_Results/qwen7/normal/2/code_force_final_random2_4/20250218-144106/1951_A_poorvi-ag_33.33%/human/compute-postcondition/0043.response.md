Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list with 'no', 'no', 'no', `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the new input string, `results` is updated to ['no', 'no', 'no']**.

The code `results.append('no')` appends the string 'no' to the list `results`. Since `results` was originally `['no', 'no', 'no']`, appending another 'no' to it changes it to `['no', 'no', 'no', 'no']`. However, the problem statement mentions that if the conditions are met, `results` should be updated to `['no', 'no', 'yes']`. Since the conditions are not specified to be checked within this line of code, we assume the conditions are not met here, and thus `results` remains `['no', 'no', 'no']`.
