Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each test case and prints the character that appears most frequently. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly. Since the string length is fixed at 5 and the characters are only 'A' or 'B', the program will always produce the correct result for any valid input.
