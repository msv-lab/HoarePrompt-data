Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `s`, `ac` is 2 if the first character of `s` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ac` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ac` is 1 if the first character of `s` is 'A', or 1 if the first character is not 'A'. After executing `ac += 1`, if the first character was 'A', `ac` becomes 2; otherwise, `ac` remains 1. The other variables (`s` and `i`) remain unchanged.
