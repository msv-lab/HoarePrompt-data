Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `q` is 1, `ac` is 2, `bc` is either 1 or 2, and `s` is a non-empty string with the first two characters removed.**

Explanation: The value of `ac` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `t`, `q`, `bc`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
