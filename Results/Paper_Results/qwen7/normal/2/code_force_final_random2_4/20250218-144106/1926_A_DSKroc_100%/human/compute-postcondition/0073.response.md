Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. The variable `i` takes on each character of the string `s` in sequence.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - If the first character of `s` is 'A', then `ac` is 1. Otherwise, `bc` is 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is iterating through each character of `s`, after the previous iteration, `i` would have taken on the first character of `s`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must take on the next character of `s`.
   - The value of `ac` or `bc` will remain the same as it was determined by the first character of `s` and does not change within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will now be the second character of `s`.
   - `s` remains the same non-empty string.
   - `ac` or `bc` remains unchanged based on the first character of `s`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `s`, `ac` is 1 if the first character of `s` is 'A', otherwise `bc` is 1**.
