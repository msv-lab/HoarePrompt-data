Output State: **`nums` is the same list, `i` is `i + 2`, `idx` is `i - 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified, it implies breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `nums`, `i`, and `idx` are updated according to their initial expressions before the `break` statement was executed, and the break statement itself indicates that we exit the current control structure.
