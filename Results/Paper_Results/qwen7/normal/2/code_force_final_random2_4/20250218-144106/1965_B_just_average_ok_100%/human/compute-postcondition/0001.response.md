Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the initial value of `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, this value remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are set to the integers entered by the user.
