Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `idx` is `i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `idx`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is inside. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified in the code, we assume it breaks out of the context it was given in.
