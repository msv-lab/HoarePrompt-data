Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 17.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over the list `nums` which contains the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). Given that `nums[-1]` is 2097151, which is \(2^{20}\), and considering the condition `if nums[i] > k:` inside the loop, we need to determine the value of `k` based on the provided information.

Since the loop has executed 3 times, it means that the first three elements of the list `nums` (which are 1, 2, and 4) were not greater than `k`. This implies that `k` must be at least 8 (since \(2^3 = 8\)) but less than 16 (since \(2^4 = 16\)), because the fourth element in the list is 8.

After 3 iterations, `i` will be `3 + 2 = 5` (since it increments by 1 each time and starts from 20). However, since the loop breaks when it finds an element greater than `k`, and given that the fourth element is 8, the loop will continue until it finds an element greater than `k`. Since `k` is at least 8, the loop will continue until it reaches the fifth element, which is 16. At this point, `nums[i]` (which is 16) is greater than `k`, and the loop breaks.

Therefore, `idx` will be set to `i - 1`, which is `4` (since `i` becomes 5 after the loop breaks). But since the question asks for the final state after all iterations, and considering the loop has completed its iterations, `i` will be `21` (as it increments by 1 each iteration and there are 21 elements in the list), and `idx` will be `17` (since `i` is 21 and `idx` is `i - 4`).

Thus, the final output state is `i` is 21, `idx` is 17.
