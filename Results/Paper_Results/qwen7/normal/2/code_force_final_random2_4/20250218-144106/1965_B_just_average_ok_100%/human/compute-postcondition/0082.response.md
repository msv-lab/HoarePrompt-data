Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 21.
   - `idx` is 16.
   - `nums` contains elements such that one of them is `k - nums[idx]`, another is `k + 1`, and now includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

2. **Understanding `nums`:**
   - We know `idx` is 16, so `nums[16]` is involved in the conditions.
   - One element in `nums` is `k - nums[idx]`, which means it is `k - nums[16]`.
   - Another element in `nums` is `k + 1`.
   - There is also an additional element `k + nums[idx] + 1`, which means `k + nums[16] + 1`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(*nums)` will print all elements in the list `nums` separated by spaces.

Given the conditions, let's assume `k` is a specific value. For simplicity, let's denote `k` as a placeholder since its exact value isn't provided. The list `nums` will contain the following elements:
- `k - nums[16]`
- `k + 1`
- `k + nums[16] + 1`

Therefore, the output will be a list of these three elements.

Output: **[k - nums[16], k + 1, k + nums[16] + 1]**
