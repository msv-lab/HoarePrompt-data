State: **`idx` is -1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^20, `i` is 0, `len(nums)` is the length of the list `nums`**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(len(nums))` expression.
- The loop will iterate over the indices of the list `nums`, starting from 0 up to `len(nums) - 1`.
- Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` must be set to 0.
- The length of the list `nums` must be known to determine the number of iterations the loop will perform.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 0 and `len(nums)` to the actual length of the list `nums`.
