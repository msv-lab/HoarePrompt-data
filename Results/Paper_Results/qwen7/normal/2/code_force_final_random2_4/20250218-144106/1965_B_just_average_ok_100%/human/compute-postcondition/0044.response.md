Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `len(nums)` is 21.
   - `idx` is either -1 or remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`. 

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, then `idx` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - If `nums[i]` is not greater than `k`, then `idx` remains unchanged.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 in the range function, at the start of the first iteration, `i` is 0. After the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(nums)`, which is 21. Therefore, `i` can be 2 (the next value).

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `len(nums)` remains unchanged at 21.
   - `idx` could either remain -1 or change to 0 depending on the value of `nums[2]` and the condition `nums[i] > k`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `len(nums)` is 21, and `idx` is either -1 or 0**.
