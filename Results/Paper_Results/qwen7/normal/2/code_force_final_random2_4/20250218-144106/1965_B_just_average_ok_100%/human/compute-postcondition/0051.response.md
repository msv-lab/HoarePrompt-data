Output State: **`i` is 20, `len(nums)` is 23, `idx` is either -1 or a value between 0 and 19, `k - nums[idx]` is appended to `nums`, `nums` now contains `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `nums.append(k + 1)` appends the value of `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Since `len(nums)` was initially 22, after appending `k + 1`, the length of `nums` becomes 23. All other variables remain unchanged.
