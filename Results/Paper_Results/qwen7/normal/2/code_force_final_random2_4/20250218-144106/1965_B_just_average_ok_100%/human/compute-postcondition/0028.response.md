Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `_` (which is just a placeholder for the loop variable) and the number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`. However, since the loop variable itself is not explicitly named, we focus on the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. This means the number of iterations is dependent on user input.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `idx` is 20.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with an additional element `k - nums[20]` and `k + 1` appended to it, and `nums` now does not contain the element `1 << idx`.
   - `i` is 22.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the only thing that changes is the number of iterations.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide an input that is greater than or equal to 1 (since the loop runs for each integer in the input).

Given the current state and the fact that the loop is controlled by user input, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself.

**State:**
- The input provided by the user must be at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **the input provided by the user must be at least 1**
