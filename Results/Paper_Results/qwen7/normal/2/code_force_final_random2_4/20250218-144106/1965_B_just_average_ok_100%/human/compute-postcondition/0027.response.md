Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `idx` is 20.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with an additional element `k - nums[20]` and `k + 1` appended to it.
     - The list initially contains integers from 1 to 1048576 (since \(2^{20} = 1048576\)).
     - After appending `k - nums[20]` and `k + 1`, the list becomes \([1, 2, 4, ..., 1048576, k - 1048576, k + 1]\).
   - `i` is 22.
   - `nums` now does not contain the element \(1 << idx\), which is \(1 << 20 = 1048576\).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*nums)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the list `nums` so that each element is printed as a separate argument.
   - The list `nums` contains the integers from 1 to 1048576, followed by `k - 1048576` and `k + 1`, and does not contain 1048576 itself.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the elements of the list `nums` printed as a space-separated sequence.

Output: **1 2 4 ... 1048575 k-1048576 k+1**
