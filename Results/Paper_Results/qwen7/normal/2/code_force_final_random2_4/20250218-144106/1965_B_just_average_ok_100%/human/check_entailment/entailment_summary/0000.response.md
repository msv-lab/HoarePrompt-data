Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\). For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(k\).
2. **List Initialization**: It initializes a list `nums` with all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). This ensures that the list has enough distinct values to potentially form any sum up to \(2^{21} - 1\).
3. **Modification Based on \(k\)**:
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) and removes it from `nums`.
   - It then appends three new values to `nums`: 
     - \(k - \text{max power of 2} \leq k\)
     - \(k + 1\)
     - \(k + \text{max power of 2} + 1\)

This approach ensures that:
- No subsequence sums to \(k\) because removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) and then adding \(k - \text{max power of 2} \leq k\) and \(k + \text{max power of 2} + 1\) prevents any combination from summing exactly to \(k\).
- All numbers from 1 to \(n\) except \(k\) can be formed as a subsequence sum. This is because the remaining powers of 2 and the added values allow forming any sum from 1 to \(n\) except \(k\).

Given the constraints and the logic, the program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
