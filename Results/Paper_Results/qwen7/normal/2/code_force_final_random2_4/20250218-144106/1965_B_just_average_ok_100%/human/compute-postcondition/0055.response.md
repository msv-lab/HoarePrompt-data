Given the initial state:
- `i` is 20
- `len(nums)` is 23, meaning `nums` is a list with 23 elements
- `idx` is either -1 or a value between 0 and 19
- `nums[-1]` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`

We need to determine what will be printed when `print(*nums)` is executed. 

The `*` operator in the print statement means that `nums` will be unpacked into individual arguments, so it will print each element of the list on a separate line.

Since `nums` has 23 elements, and we know the value of `nums[-1]` but not the other elements, let's break it down:

1. `nums[-1]` is defined as `k + nums[idx] + 1`. This gives us the last element of the list.
2. The other 22 elements of `nums` are not specified, so we cannot determine their exact values.

Therefore, the output will include 23 lines, where the last line will be `k + nums[idx] + 1`, and the other 22 lines will be the unspecified values of the other elements in the list.

Output: **22 unspecified values, followed by k + nums[idx] + 1**
