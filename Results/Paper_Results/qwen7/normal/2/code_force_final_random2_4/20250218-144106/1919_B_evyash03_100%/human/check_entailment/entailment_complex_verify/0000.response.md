### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code against the problem statement and the original assessment.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays.
- The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- The total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Counts the number of `+` characters in the string `expression`.
   - Calculates the number of `-` characters as `length - count`.
   - Returns the absolute difference between the count of `+` and `-` characters.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads the length of the string `n` and the string `expression`.
   - Calls `func_1(expression, length)` and prints the result.

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The function `func_1` does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
- It simply counts the number of `+` characters and calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters, which does not guarantee the minimum penalty.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
5
+-+-+-
```

- The correct approach would be to split the array into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a total penalty of 0.
- However, the program would incorrectly calculate the penalty as follows:
  - Count of `+` = 3
  - Count of `-` = 2
  - Difference = |3 - 2| = 1
  - Penalty = 1 * (5 - 1) = 4

This is not the optimal solution, as the correct minimum penalty is 0.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty. It only counts the number of `+` and `-` characters and calculates the difference, which does not guarantee the optimal solution.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
