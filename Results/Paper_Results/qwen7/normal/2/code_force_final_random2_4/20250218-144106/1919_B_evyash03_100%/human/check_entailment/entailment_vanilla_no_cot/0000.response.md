Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of '+' characters and calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not necessarily lead to the minimum penalty.
2. The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of penalties is minimized. The current implementation does not consider different possible splits and their associated penalties.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to consider all possible ways to split the array and calculate the penalty for each split, then choose the split with the minimum penalty. This likely involves dynamic programming or a similar approach to efficiently explore all possible splits.
