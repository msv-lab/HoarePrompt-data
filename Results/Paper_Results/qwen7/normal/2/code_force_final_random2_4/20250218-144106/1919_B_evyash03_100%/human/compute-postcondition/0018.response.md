Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `expression`, a string of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-", and `length`, an integer representing the length of the string `expression`. It returns the absolute difference between the value of `sub` (which is `length - count`) and `count`, where `count` is the number of "+" characters in the string `expression` and `sub` is the number of "-" characters.**
