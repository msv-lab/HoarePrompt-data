Output State: **The program returns the absolute difference between the value of `sub` (which is `length - count`) and `count`**

To break it down:
- `length` is the length of the string `expression`
- `count` is the total number of '+' characters in the string `expression`
- `sub` is calculated as `length - count`
- The code returns `abs(sub - count)`, which is the absolute difference between `sub` and `count`

Given the definitions, the final output is the absolute difference between `length - count` and `count`.
