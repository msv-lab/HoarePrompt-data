Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains three variables: `char`, `expression`, and `length`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - `count` is given as 0.
   - `expression` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - `length` is an integer representing the length of the string `expression`, such that \(1 \leq \text{length} \leq 5000\).

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the `expression` string.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - For the loop to start executing, the `expression` string must have at least one character. If `expression` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `char` will take the value of each character in the `expression` string during each iteration, starting from the first character.
   - The variable `length` remains constant throughout the loop and is equal to the length of the `expression` string.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `expression` must have at least one character.
- `char` should be set to the first character of `expression`.
- `length` should remain unchanged and be equal to the length of `expression`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment would be:

**State: **`count` is 0, `expression` is a non-empty string of length `length`, `char` is the first character in `expression`, `length` is the length of `expression`**.
