### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the subarray sums multiplied by their lengths. 

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string (`length`) and the string itself (`expression`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the string `expression` and its length `length`.
   - It counts the number of '+' characters in the string, which corresponds to the number of 1's in the array `a`.
   - It calculates `sub` as the difference between the total length and the count of '+' characters.
   - Finally, it returns the absolute difference between `count` and `sub`.

#### Function `func_1` Detailed Analysis:
- **Count Calculation**:
  ```python
  count = 0
  for char in expression:
      if char == '+':
          count += 1
  ```
  This loop correctly counts the number of '+' characters in the string.

- **Subtraction Calculation**:
  ```python
  sub = length - count
  ```
  Here, `sub` represents the number of '-' characters in the string.

- **Return Value**:
  ```python
  return abs(sub - count)
  ```
  The function returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters. However, this is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty.

#### Correct Approach:
To minimize the penalty, we need to split the array `a` such that the sum of the absolute values of the subarray sums multiplied by their lengths is minimized. A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal splits.

#### Conclusion:
The current implementation in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. It simply returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct. The given program does not solve the problem correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
