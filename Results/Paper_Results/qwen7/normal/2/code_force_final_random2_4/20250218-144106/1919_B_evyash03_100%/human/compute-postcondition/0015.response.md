Output State: **The final value of `count` will be equal to the total number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `count` will hold the total number of '+' characters found in the string `expression`. This means that `count` will increment by 1 for each '+' character it encounters as it iterates through every character in `expression`.
