### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code.

#### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the subarray sums multiplied by their lengths.

#### Given Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string (`length`) and the string itself (`expression`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the string `expression` and its length `length`.
   - It counts the number of '+' characters in the string, which corresponds to the number of 1's in the array `a`.
   - It calculates `sub` as the difference between the total length and the count of '+' characters.
   - Finally, it returns the absolute difference between `count` and `sub`.

#### Issue Identification:
- The logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. Instead, it simply returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

#### Optimal Solution:
To solve this problem optimally, we need to consider the following:
- If the string `s` has more '+' characters than '-', we should try to group as many '+' characters together to minimize the penalty.
- Conversely, if the string `s` has more '-' characters, we should try to group as many '-' characters together.

Here's how we can achieve this:
1. Count the number of '+' and '-' characters.
2. Calculate the minimum penalty by considering the optimal way to split the array.

#### Correct Approach:
- If the number of '+' characters is greater than the number of '-' characters, the optimal split would be to have all '+' characters in one subarray and all '-' characters in another subarray.
- If the number of '-' characters is greater, the same logic applies but with '-' characters.

#### Revised Function:
```python
def func_1(expression, length):
    count_plus = expression.count('+')
    count_minus = expression.count('-')
    
    if count_plus >= count_minus:
        # More '+' characters
        penalty = count_minus * 2
    else:
        # More '-' characters
        penalty = count_plus * 2
    
    return penalty
```

#### Evaluation:
- The revised function correctly calculates the minimum penalty by ensuring that the subarrays are split optimally.
- The original assessment identified the issue correctly but did not provide a solution. The provided code does not solve the problem as intended.

#### Final Evaluation:
Given the revised approach, the original program is incorrect. However, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the issue but did not provide a solution.

**Final: False**

The given program is still incorrect because it does not implement the optimal solution to minimize the penalty.
