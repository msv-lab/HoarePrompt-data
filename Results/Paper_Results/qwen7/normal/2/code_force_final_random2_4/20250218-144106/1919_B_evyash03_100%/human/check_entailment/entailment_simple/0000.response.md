Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.
2. The penalty calculation involves splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray as the product of the absolute value of the sum of its elements and its length.
3. The provided code does not correctly implement the penalty calculation logic. Instead, it calculates the absolute difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string `expression`, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.
4. The function `func_1` does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. It simply counts the number of `+` characters and calculates a value based on the difference between the total length and this count, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to implement the required logic for calculating the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array.
