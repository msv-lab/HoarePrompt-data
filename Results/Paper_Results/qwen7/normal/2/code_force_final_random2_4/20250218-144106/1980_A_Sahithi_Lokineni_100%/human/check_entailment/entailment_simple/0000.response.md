### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **Problem Count Initialization**: The dictionary `d` is initialized to count the occurrences of each difficulty level. However, the variable `default_value` is not defined, which will cause a NameError. This is a critical issue because the default value for the dictionary should be set to 0 to handle cases where a particular difficulty level does not exist in the input string.
3. **Counting Problems**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string `s`.
4. **Calculating Missing Problems**: For each difficulty level, the program calculates the number of additional problems needed to meet the requirement of having at least `m` rounds. This logic is correct.
5. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems required for each test case, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program is almost correct, but it fails due to the undefined `default_value`. If we assume the intention was to initialize the dictionary with a default value of 0, the program would work as expected.

### Corrected Code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Initialize with default value 0
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
