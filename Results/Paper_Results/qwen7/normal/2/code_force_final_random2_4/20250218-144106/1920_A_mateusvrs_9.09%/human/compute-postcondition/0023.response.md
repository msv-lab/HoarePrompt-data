Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `a`. Since both `a` and `x` are input integers, `ax` will take the value of whichever is smaller between `a` and `x`. The values of `a` and `x` remain unchanged.
