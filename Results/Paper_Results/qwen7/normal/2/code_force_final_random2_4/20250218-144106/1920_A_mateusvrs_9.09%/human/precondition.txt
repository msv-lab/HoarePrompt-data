t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
