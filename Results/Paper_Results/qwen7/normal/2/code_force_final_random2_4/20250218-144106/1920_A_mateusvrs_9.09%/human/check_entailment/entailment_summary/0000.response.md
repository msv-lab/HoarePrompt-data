Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`n`).
   - It initializes variables `ax` and `bx` to handle the constraints of type 1 and 2, respectively. `ax` is initialized to a large value to ensure any valid `x` from type 2 constraints will update it. `bx` is initialized to `-1` to ensure any valid `x` from type 1 constraints will update it.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store the values of `x` from type 3 constraints.
3. **Updating Variables**:
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.
4. **Calculating Result**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to the result list because there are no valid values of `k` that satisfy all constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in this range (`ax - bx + 1`).
5. **Outputting Results**: It prints the results for all test cases.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program seems to correctly handle all constraints and produce the expected results. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
