Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was previously undefined, it is now a set containing only the value `x`. The values of `a`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.
