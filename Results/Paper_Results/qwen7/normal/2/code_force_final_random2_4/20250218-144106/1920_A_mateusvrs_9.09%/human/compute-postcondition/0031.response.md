Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `n` is 0, `bx` is equal to the maximum of `x` and `bx` (which is `x` since `bx` was undefined).**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the maximum between `x` and `bx` to `bx`. Since `bx` was undefined, it defaults to `x`. The other variables (`a`, `x`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
