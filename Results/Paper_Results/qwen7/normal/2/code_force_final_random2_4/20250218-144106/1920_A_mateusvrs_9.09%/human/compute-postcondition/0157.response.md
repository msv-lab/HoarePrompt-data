Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `bx` will be the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` will be the minimum value among all `x` values where `a` was 2, and `cx` will be a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2.**

This means that `bx` will hold the highest `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, `ax` will hold the lowest `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, and `cx` will contain all distinct `x` values that were input when `a` was neither 1 nor 2.
