Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `r` is an empty list, `_` is now 1, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is an input integer. If `a` equals 1, then `x` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, then `x` is updated to the minimum of `x` and 2. Otherwise, `x` is added to the set `cx`, and `a` is neither 1 nor 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx` (if `bx` was defined previously, otherwise `bx` is `x`). If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `a`. Otherwise, `cx` contains the value of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `n` is 0. If `a` equals 1, then `bx` is equal to `x`. If `a` equals 2 and `x` is less than `a`, then `ax` is `x`; otherwise, `ax` is `a`. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` is a set containing `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
