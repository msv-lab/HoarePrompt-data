Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are overlapping constraints. Specifically, the program calculates the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of elements in `cx` that fall within this range. However, this approach fails when there are multiple constraints of type 3 that overlap with the range `[bx, ax]`.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
4
3
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
- Expected Output:
```
7
```
- Actual Output:
```
0
```

In this case, the constraints are:
1. \( k \geq 3 \)
2. \( k \leq 10 \)
3. \( k \neq 1 \)
4. \( k \neq 5 \)

The valid range for \( k \) is from 3 to 10, excluding 1 and 5. The program calculates the range as `[3, 10]` but does not account for the exclusion of 1 and 5, resulting in an incorrect count of 0 instead of 7.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly handle the exclusion of specific values within the range `[bx, ax]`. This can be done by iterating through the set of excluded values and adjusting the count accordingly.
