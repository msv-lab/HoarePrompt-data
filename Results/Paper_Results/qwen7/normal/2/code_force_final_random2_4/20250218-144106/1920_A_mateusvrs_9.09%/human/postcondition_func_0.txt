The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of constraints, followed by `t` pairs of integers `(a, x)` representing different types of constraints. It then calculates and stores a result for each test case based on the maximum and minimum values of `x` for types 1 and 2, and the count of unique values of `x` for type 3 within a specified range. Finally, it prints a list of these results, where each result is either 0 or the difference between `ax` and `bx` adjusted by the count of values in `cx` within the range `[bx, ax]`.
