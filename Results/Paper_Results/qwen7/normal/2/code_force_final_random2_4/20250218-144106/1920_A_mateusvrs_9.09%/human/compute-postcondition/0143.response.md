Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is added to the set `cx`.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since sets in Python do not allow duplicate values, if `x` was already in `cx`, it would remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `a` are not affected by this operation.
