Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` will be 0, `a` will be an integer from the last input, `x` will be an integer from the last input, `bx` will be the maximum value among all `x` where `a` was 1 during the loop, `ax` will be the minimum value among all `x` where `a` was 2 during the loop, and `cx` will be a set containing all `x` where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 during the loop. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cx` contains at least one element. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cx` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element from `cx`, and `tmp` is incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is further incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cx` contains at least one element (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element from `cx`, and `tmp` is incremented by 2 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`; otherwise, `tmp` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
