Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`**.

Explanation: The variable `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and its previous value. Since the initial value of `bx` is not specified, it is assumed to be the value before the current operation. The values of `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
