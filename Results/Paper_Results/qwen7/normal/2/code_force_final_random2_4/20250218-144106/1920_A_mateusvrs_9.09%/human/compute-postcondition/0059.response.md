Postcondition: **After all iterations, `n` will be 0, `ax` will be the smallest value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `bx` will be the largest value among all `x` where `a` was 1, and `cx` will be a set containing all `x` where `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` will be `[0]`. Otherwise, `r` will contain the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` will be increased by the total number of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`**.
