Output State: After all iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. `r` will be a list containing the cumulative results from each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, the corresponding entry in `r` will be 0. Otherwise, it will be `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`. The variables `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` will no longer be used and can be considered as having been processed and reset within each iteration.
