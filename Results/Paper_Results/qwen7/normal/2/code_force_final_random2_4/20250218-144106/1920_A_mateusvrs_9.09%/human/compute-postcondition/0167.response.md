Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `cx`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `cx`.

3. **Determine the postconditions**:
   - `cx` must have at least one element.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `i` is set to `bx + tmp` and `tmp` is increased by 1.

4. **Analyze the given postcondition**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `cx`, the only variable that changes within the loop is `i`.
   - `tmp` is incremented within the loop but its value is not directly relevant to the loop continuation condition.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `cx` must have at least one element.
   - For the loop to execute again, `cx` must still have at least one element.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `cx`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cx` must have at least one element**
