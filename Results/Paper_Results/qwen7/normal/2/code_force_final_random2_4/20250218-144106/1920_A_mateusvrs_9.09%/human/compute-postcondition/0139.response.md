Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is an integer from the input.
   - `x` is an integer from the input.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `n` iterations. For each iteration, the values of `a` and `x` are updated based on the value of `a`.

3. **Loop Body**: Since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider the possible updates to `x` and other variables based on the value of `a`.

4. **Possible Updates**:
   - If `a` is 1, `x` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.
   - If `a` is 2, `x` is updated to the minimum of the original `x` and `ax`, and `ax` is also updated to the same value.
   - If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `x` remains unchanged and is stored in `cx`.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the state.
   - The only relevant variables for the loop condition are `n`, `a`, and `x`.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The value of `a` and `x` will be updated based on the loop body, but we don't know the exact values without the loop body. However, we can say that `a` and `x` will be updated according to the rules mentioned above.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the fact that `n` must still be greater than 0, and `a` and `x` will be updated based on the loop body.

**State:**
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` and `x` will be updated according to the loop body.

Since we cannot specify the exact updated values of `a` and `x` without the loop body, we can only state the conditions under which the loop can continue.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `x` will be updated according to the loop body**.
