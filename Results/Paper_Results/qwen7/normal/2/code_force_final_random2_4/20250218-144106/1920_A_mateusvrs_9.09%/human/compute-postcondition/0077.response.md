Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either 1 or 2 or an integer from input (but not equal to 1), `x` is an integer from input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 2. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` contains the value `x`.
