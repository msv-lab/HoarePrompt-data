Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is used to iterate over the set `cx`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is used to iterate over the elements of `cx`, the initial state of `i` should be one of the elements in `cx`.

3. **Determine the State of `cx`**: For the loop to execute, `cx` must contain at least one element. If `cx` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`tmp`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `cx` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cx` must contain at least one element**
