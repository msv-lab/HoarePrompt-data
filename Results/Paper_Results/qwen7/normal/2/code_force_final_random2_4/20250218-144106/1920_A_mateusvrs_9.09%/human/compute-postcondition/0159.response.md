Output State: **`bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values where `a` was 2, and `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2; `r` is a list containing the value 0.**

The code `r.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `r`. The values of `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` remain unchanged from their initial states.
