Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `n` will be 0, `ax` will be the smallest value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `bx` will be less than `ax` among all `x` where `a` was 1, and `cx` will be a set containing all `x` where `a` was neither 1 nor 2.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `tmp`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `ax`, `bx`, or `cx`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while updating `tmp` to 0.
