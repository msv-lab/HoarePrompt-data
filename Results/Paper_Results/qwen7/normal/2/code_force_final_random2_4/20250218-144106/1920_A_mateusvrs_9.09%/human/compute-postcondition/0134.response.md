Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, and `a` is not equal to 1, and `a` is not equal to 2; `cx` now contains the value `x`.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `x` is an integer from the input, it is added to the set `cx`. All other variables remain unchanged.
