Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning the first integer to `a` and the second integer to `x`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was already defined as a positive integer in the initial state.
