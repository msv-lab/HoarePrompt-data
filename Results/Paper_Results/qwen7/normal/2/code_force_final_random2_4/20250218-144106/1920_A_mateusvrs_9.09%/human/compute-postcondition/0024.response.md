Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer, `cx` contains the value `x`**.

The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was not defined before, it is assumed to be a set. After executing this line, `cx` now contains the value `x`. The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged.
