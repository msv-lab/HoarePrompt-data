Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `cx`. For each element `i` in `cx`, the condition `if i >= bx and i <= ax` is checked, and if true, `tmp` is incremented by 1.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cx` contains at least one element.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `cx`, the variable `i` will take the next value from `cx`.
   - The variable `tmp` might have been incremented during the previous iteration based on the condition `i >= bx and i <= ax`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `cx` will still contain at least one element because it needs to continue the loop.
   - `i` will be the next element from `cx`.
   - `tmp` will either remain the same or be incremented by 1 depending on the condition.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `cx` still contains at least one element.
- `i` is the next element from `cx`.
- `tmp` is either the same as the previous value or incremented by 1.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` or `tmp` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as follows:

**State: **`cx` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element from `cx`, `tmp` is either the same as the previous value or incremented by 1**.
