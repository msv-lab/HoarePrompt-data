You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, indicating the type of constraint and the value x respectively. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.

    #State: Output State: After all iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. `r` will be a list containing the cumulative results from each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, the corresponding entry in `r` will be 0. Otherwise, it will be `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`. The variables `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` will no longer be used and can be considered as having been processed and reset within each iteration.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: 0\n[r[1]\n...\nr[n]] (where r[i] is either 0 or ax[i] - bx[i] + 1 - tmp[i] for each iteration, with tmp[i] being the count of elements in cx[i] that fall within the range [bx[i], ax[i]])



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are overlapping constraints. Specifically, the program calculates the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of elements in `cx` that fall within this range. However, this approach fails when there are multiple constraints of type 3 that overlap with the range `[bx, ax]`.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
4
3
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
- Expected Output:
```
7
```
- Actual Output:
```
0
```

In this case, the constraints are:
1. \( k \geq 3 \)
2. \( k \leq 10 \)
3. \( k \neq 1 \)
4. \( k \neq 5 \)

The valid range for \( k \) is from 3 to 10, excluding 1 and 5. The program calculates the range as `[3, 10]` but does not account for the exclusion of 1 and 5, resulting in an incorrect count of 0 instead of 7.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly handle the exclusion of specific values within the range `[bx, ax]`. This can be done by iterating through the set of excluded values and adjusting the count accordingly.
