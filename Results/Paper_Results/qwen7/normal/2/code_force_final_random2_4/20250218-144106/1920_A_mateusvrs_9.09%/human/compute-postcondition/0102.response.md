Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the set `cx`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the set `cx`, it must be one of the elements in `cx`. However, since the loop hasn't started yet, `i` is not yet initialized.

3. **Determine the State of `cx`**: The set `cx` contains all values of `x` where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 during the loop. For the loop to execute, `cx` must contain at least one element.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `a`, `x`, `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `tmp`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop's execution.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the set `cx` must contain at least one element.

**State:**
- `cx` must contain at least one element.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`cx` must contain at least one element**
