Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the largest value among all `x` where `a` was 1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is increased by the total number of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.**

Explanation: The code sets `ax` to the value `1000000007`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `ax` is now explicitly defined, while the values of `bx`, `cx`, `r`, and `tmp` remain as they were initially described.
