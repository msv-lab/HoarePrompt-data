Output State: **`cx` must contain at least one element (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element in `cx`, `tmp` is increased by 2**.

Explanation: The variable `tmp` was previously increased by 1, and the code `tmp += 1` increases `tmp` by another 1, making it increased by 2 in total. The values of `cx` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
