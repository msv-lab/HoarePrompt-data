Output State: **`li` now contains the element `a + k * c + d * (h + 1)`, `a`, `c`, `d`, and `h` retain their original values, `h` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Since `h` was incremented by 1 before the append operation, the new element added to `li` is `a + k * c + d * (h + 1)`. The values of `a`, `c`, `d`, and `h` remain unchanged, and `h` is incremented by 1.
