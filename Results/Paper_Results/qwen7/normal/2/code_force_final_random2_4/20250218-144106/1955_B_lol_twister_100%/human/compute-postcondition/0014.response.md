Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for h in range(0, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `h` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `h` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `li` has a new element which is `a + k * c + d * h`.
   - `a`, `c`, `d`, and `h` retain their original values.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `h` in the range from `0` to `n-1`, at the end of each iteration, `h` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if `h` was `i` (let's say `i` was the value of `h` at the end of the previous iteration), then at the start of the next iteration, `h` will be `i + 1`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - The value of `h` will change to `i + 1`.
   - The value of `li` remains unchanged because the new element added to `li` is based on the original values of `a`, `c`, `d`, and `h`, and these values do not change within the loop.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`li` has a new element which is `a + k * c + d * h`, and `a`, `c`, `d`, and `h` retain their original values, `h` is `i + 1`**.
