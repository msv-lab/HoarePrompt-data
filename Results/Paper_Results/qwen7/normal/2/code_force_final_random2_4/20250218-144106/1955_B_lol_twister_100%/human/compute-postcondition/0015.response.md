Output State: **`li` now contains the element `a + k * c + d * (i + 1)`, `a`, `c`, `d`, and `h` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Since `h` is defined as `i + 1`, the appended value becomes `a + k * c + d * (i + 1)`. The values of `a`, `c`, `d`, and `h` remain unchanged from their original values.
