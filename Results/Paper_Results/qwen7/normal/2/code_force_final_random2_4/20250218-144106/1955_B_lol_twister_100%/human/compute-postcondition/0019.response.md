Output State: The list `li` will contain `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. Specifically, `li` will be `[a + k * c, a + k * c + d, a + k * c + 2*d, ..., a + k * c + (n-1)*d]`.

In this final state, the list `li` starts with the value `a + k * c` and increments by `d` for each subsequent element, up to `n` elements in total. The variables `a`, `c`, `d`, and `k` retain their original values, and `h` is no longer used in the list construction but was incremented in the loop to reach `n-1`.
