Output State: **`li` is a sorted list with `n` elements: `a + k * c`, `a + k * c + d`, `a + k * c + 2*d`, ..., `a + k * c + (n-1)*d`.**

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the list `li` in ascending order. Each element in the list `li` is of the form `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. After sorting, the smallest element will be first, and the largest will be last. The variables `a`, `c`, `d`, and `k` retain their original values, and the list `li` now contains `n` elements sorted in ascending order.
