State: **`k` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, h is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `h` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `0 <= h < n` must be true.
3. Initially, `h` is set to 0.
4. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to start executing (since `h` starts at 0).
5. Given the constraint `2 <= n <= 500`, we can adjust `n` to be within this range.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be an integer in the range [2, 500] and `h` is initialized to 0.
