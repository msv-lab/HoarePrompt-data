Output State: **`k` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `h` is 0, `li` is a list containing the value `a + k * c + d * h`.**

The code appends the value of `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given the initial state, `k` is 0 and `h` is 0, so the expression simplifies to `a + 0 * c + 0 * h`, which is just `a`. Therefore, `li` now contains the value `a`.
