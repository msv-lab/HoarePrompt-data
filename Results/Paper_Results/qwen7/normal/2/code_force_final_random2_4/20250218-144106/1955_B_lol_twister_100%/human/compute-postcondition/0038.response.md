Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (an integer between 2 and 500), `c` and `d` (integers between 1 and \(10^6\)), and a list `l` containing \(n^2\) integers each in the range [1, \(10^9\)]. It generates a new list `li` by calculating values based on `a` (the minimum value in `l`), `c`, `d`, and `k` (ranging from 0 to `n-1`). After sorting both `li` and `l`, the function checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.**
