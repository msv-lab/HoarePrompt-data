Reasoning:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to check if the given array `l` can form a progressive square based on the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.

1. The function `func_1` starts by finding the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
2. It then constructs a list `li` where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1` and `k` fixed at `0` for the first row.
3. Since the progressive square is uniquely defined by `a`, `c`, and `d`, the list `li` should match the sorted version of `l` if the elements in `l` can indeed form a progressive square.
4. The function sorts both `li` and `l` and compares them. If they are equal, it returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the provided solution correctly determines whether the array `l` can form a progressive square for the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.

Correctness: **True**
