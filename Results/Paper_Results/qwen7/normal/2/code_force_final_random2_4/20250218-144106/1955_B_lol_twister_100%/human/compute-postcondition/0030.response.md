Output State: `li` is a list with `n` elements: `a + k * c`, `a + k * c + d`, `a + k * c + 2*d`, ..., `a + k * c + (n-1)*d`. The value of `n` must be greater than 0.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `li` will contain `n` elements where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. This means the list `li` will start with the value `a + k * c` and increment by `d` for each subsequent element, up to `n` elements in total. The variables `a`, `c`, `d`, and `k` retain their original values, and `h` is no longer used in the list construction but was incremented in the loop to reach `n-1`.
