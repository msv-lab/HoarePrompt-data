Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. The logic for generating the progressive square is flawed because it assumes that the minimum value in the list `l` is `a_{1,1}` (i.e., the top-left element of the progressive square). However, this assumption is not necessarily true. The actual `a_{1,1}` should be the smallest possible value that fits the formula \(a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\) for all \(1 \leq i, j \leq n\).

To fix this, we need to find the correct starting value `a_{1,1}` that fits the formula and then generate the expected progressive square. Here's the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    # Find the correct starting value a_{1,1}
    for a11 in range(min(l), max(l) + 1):
        li = [a11 + k * c + d * h for k in range(n) for h in range(n)]
        li.sort()
        l.sort()
        if l == li:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

This corrected function iterates through all possible values of `a_{1,1}` within the range of the input list `l`, generates the corresponding progressive square, and checks if it matches the input list. If a match is found, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO' after checking all possibilities.
