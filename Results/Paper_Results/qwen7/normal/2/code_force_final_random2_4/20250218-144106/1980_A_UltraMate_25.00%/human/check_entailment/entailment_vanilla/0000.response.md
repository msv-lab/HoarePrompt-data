Let's break down the problem and the given solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - Number of test cases `t`
   - For each test case:
     - Number of existing problems `n`
     - Number of upcoming rounds `m`
     - A string `s` representing the difficulties of the existing problems (each character is from 'A' to 'G')

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure there are at least `m` problems for each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.

3. **Constraints:**
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`
   - `1 ≤ m ≤ 5`

### Given Solution Analysis:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `ans` to 0.
   - Define `p` as a string containing the difficulty levels 'ABCDEF'.

3. **Count Existing Problems:**
   - Use `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in `s`.

4. **Calculate Missing Problems:**
   - Iterate over each difficulty level in `p`:
     - If the difficulty level is not in `hmp`, it means no problems of that difficulty exist, so add `m` to `ans`.
     - If the difficulty level exists but the count is less than `m`, calculate how many more problems are needed and add that to `ans`.

5. **Output Result:**
   - Print the total number of additional problems required for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic correctly identifies the missing difficulty levels and calculates the necessary additions.
- The approach handles all constraints and examples provided.

### Conclusion:
The given solution accurately computes the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
