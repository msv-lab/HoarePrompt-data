Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and now `t` is replaced by the integer input value.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial condition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 is maintained, but now `t` holds the specific integer value entered by the user.
