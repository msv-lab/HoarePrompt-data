Output State: **`i` is 'A', `p` remains 'ABCDEF', and `ans` is 'mmmmm'.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over each character in `p` which is 'ABCDEF'. Since `hmp` is initially an empty set and does not contain any of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', or 'F', `ans` will increment by `m` for each iteration. Given that the loop runs for all 6 characters, `ans` will increment by `m` six times, resulting in `ans` being equal to 'mmmmm'.
