Output State: **`ans` is `m`, `i` is 'B', `p` remains 'ABCDEF'**.

Explanation: The code `ans += m` adds the value of `m` to `ans`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `m`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`, but we know that `ans` is now equal to its previous value plus `m`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
