Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in p:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: 
   - `i` is currently 'B'.
   - `p` must be 'ABCDEF'.
   - `ans` is `0 + 2*m`.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `s` is the input string from the user.
   - `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in the string `s`.
   - The character 'i' is not in the counter `hmp`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is 'B' and `p` is 'ABCDEF', the loop will continue as long as `i` is within the string 'ABCDEF'.
   - After the current iteration where `i` is 'B', the next value of `i` will be 'C'.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will change to 'C'.
   - `p` remains 'ABCDEF'.
   - `ans` remains `0 + 2*m`.
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - `n` remains an input integer.
   - `m` remains an input integer.
   - `s` remains the input string from the user.
   - `hmp` remains a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in the string `s`.
   - The character 'i' (which is now 'C') is not yet in the counter `hmp`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 'C', `p` must be 'ABCDEF', `ans` is `0 + 2*m`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, and the character 'i' is not in the counter `hmp`.**
