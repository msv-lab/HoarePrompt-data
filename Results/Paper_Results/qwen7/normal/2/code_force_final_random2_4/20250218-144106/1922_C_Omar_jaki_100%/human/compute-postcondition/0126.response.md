Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t, another integer n, a list a of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, and an integer m. Additionally, there are m queries, each consisting of two distinct integers x_i and y_i. The function processes each query and returns the result based on the given conditions.**

For each test case, the function processes m queries, where each query involves two indices x_i and y_i from the list a. The function does not explicitly return a single value but processes and handles multiple queries for each test case.
