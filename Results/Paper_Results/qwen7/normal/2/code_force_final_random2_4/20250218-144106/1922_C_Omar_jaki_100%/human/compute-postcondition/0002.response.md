Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue as long as the tuple `t` is non-empty.

2. **Current State**: The state right before the loop is that `t` is a tuple of integers returned by the lambda function `r()`.

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**: For the loop to execute at least once, the tuple `t` must be non-empty. Since the current state does not specify whether `t` is empty or not, we need to ensure that `t` is non-empty.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to adjust the state such that `t` is guaranteed to be non-empty when the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be modified to ensure that `t` is a non-empty tuple.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a non-empty tuple of integers returned by the lambda function `r()`**
