Output State: **`b` is updated by adding `b[-2] + v`, `v` is now `y - x`, `x` is now `a[i+2]`, `y` is now `a[i+3]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `v` by setting it to `y - x`. Given the initial conditions, `x` is now `a[i+2]` and `y` is now `a[i+3]`. The value of `b` is updated by adding `b[-2]` (which was previously `a[i+1]`) and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
