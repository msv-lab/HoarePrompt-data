Output State: **`t` is a non-empty tuple of integers where each element is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `t -= 1` attempts to subtract 1 from the tuple `t`. However, tuples in Python cannot be modified directly using `-=`. Instead, this operation would raise a TypeError. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a non-empty tuple of integers, the direct subtraction operation is not applicable. Therefore, the tuple `t` remains unchanged, but it is noted that each element in `t` would hypothetically be decreased by 1 if such an operation were possible.
