Output State: **`u` is False, `c` is the return value of `r()`, `d` is the return value of `r()`, `t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0], `b` is a list containing [0, 0, 0, 0], `v` is `y - x`, `w` is undefined, `x` is undefined, `y` is undefined, `z` is undefined**

Explanation: The code `v = y - x` assigns the value of `y - x` to `v`. However, since `x` and `y` are both undefined, `v` remains undefined. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
