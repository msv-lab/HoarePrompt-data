You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and each query consists of two distinct integers x_i and y_i such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n.

            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `u` is False, `c` is the return value of `r()` from the last iteration, `d` is the second return value of `r()` from the last iteration, `b` is a list with its length equal to the length of `a` plus one, starting with the initial value of `-1000000000.0`, followed by a series of values calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a` after all iterations of the loop have been executed.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `u` becomes `False` because it is decremented until it reaches zero. The values of `c` and `d` are set to the return values of the function `r()` called in the last iteration of the loop, and these values do not change further. The list `b` retains its structure and values based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting with the initial value of `-1000000000.0`, after all iterations of the loop have been executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer t indicating the number of subsequent cases, an integer n representing the size of a list a, the list a itself containing n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, and an integer m denoting the number of queries. For each query, the function takes two distinct integers x and y and calculates and prints the difference between specific values in a list b. The list b is constructed based on the differences between consecutive elements of a. After processing all test cases and queries, the function outputs the results of the last query performed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and their coordinates `a`.
   - It also reads the number of queries `m`.

2. **Coordinate Manipulation:**
   - The coordinates `a` are modified to include `-1000000000.0` at the start and `2000000000.0` at the end.
   - This modification helps in handling edge cases where the closest city might be at the boundary.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The program calculates distances between consecutive cities and stores them in list `b`.
   - Specifically, it calculates the differences between consecutive coordinates and updates the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city using these distances.
   - The list `b` is constructed such that `b[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach the `i-th` city starting from the first city.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices of the two cities involved.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost to travel between these two cities using the precomputed values in `b`.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Correctness of Distance Calculation
- The distances between consecutive cities are correctly calculated.
- The cumulative cost calculation ensures that the minimum cost to reach each city is stored efficiently.

#### Correctness of Query Handling
- The program correctly identifies the minimum cost to travel between any two cities using the precomputed values in `b`.
- The logic for determining the minimum cost for each query is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Edge Cases and Constraints
- The additional constraints ensure that the solution handles large inputs efficiently.
- The unique closest city condition is respected by the program's logic.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It accurately computes the minimum cost for each query using the precomputed distances and cumulative costs.
