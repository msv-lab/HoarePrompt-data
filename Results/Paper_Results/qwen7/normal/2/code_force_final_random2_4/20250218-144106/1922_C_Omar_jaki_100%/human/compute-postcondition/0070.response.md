Output State: **`u` is now falsy**.

Explanation: Initially, `u` must be truthy. After executing `u -= 1`, `u` is decremented by 1. Since `u` was originally truthy (which means it was a non-zero value), decrementing it by 1 will make it a zero, which is falsy in Python. Therefore, `u` is now falsy. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
