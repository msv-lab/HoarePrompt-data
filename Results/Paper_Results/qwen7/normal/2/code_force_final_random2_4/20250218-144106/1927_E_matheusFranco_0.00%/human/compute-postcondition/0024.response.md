Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 2`, and `i` is less than `len(permutation)`**

Explanation: The code increments `curr_v` by 1. Given that `curr_v` was originally the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 1`, after incrementing, `curr_v` becomes the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
