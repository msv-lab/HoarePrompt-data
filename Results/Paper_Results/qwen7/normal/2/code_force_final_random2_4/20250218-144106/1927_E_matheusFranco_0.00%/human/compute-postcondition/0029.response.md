Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1 + 1`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 3`, and `i` is less than `len(permutation)`**.

Explanation: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`, making it `i + 2k`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
