Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The function `func_1()` constructs a permutation of length `n`.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of zeros with length `n`.
   - It uses a variable `idx` to keep track of the current index in the permutation.
   - It uses `idx_v` to keep track of the value to be assigned at the current index.
   - It iterates over the range `k` times, assigning values in a specific pattern:
     - For each `i` in the range `k`, it starts assigning values from index `i` and increments by `k` each time.
     - The value being assigned increases by 1 each time it is placed in the permutation.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

### Verification of Correctness

To verify if this approach generates a k-level permutation, let's consider the construction logic:

- The program assigns values in a way that ensures every `k`-length segment will have unique starting points, but it doesn't ensure that the sums of these segments will differ by no more than 1.

- Specifically, the assignment pattern:
  - Assigns values in blocks of size `k` starting from different indices.
  - Ensures that each block has a unique starting point but does not control the sum differences directly.

- To check if the constructed permutation is k-level, we need to ensure that the sums of any two consecutive segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. However, the given implementation does not inherently guarantee this property.

### Example Test Case Analysis

Let's manually construct and check a few examples to see if the program works as intended:

#### Example 1: \( n = 2, k = 2 \)
- Permutation: `[1, 2]`
- Sums: \( [1+2] = [3] \)
- Difference: \( \max(3) - \min(3) = 0 \leq 1 \) (Correct)

#### Example 2: \( n = 3, k = 2 \)
- Permutation: `[1, 3, 2]`
- Sums: \( [1+3], [3+2] = [4, 5] \)
- Difference: \( \max(5) - \min(4) = 1 \leq 1 \) (Correct)

#### Example 3: \( n = 10, k = 4 \)
- Permutation: `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`
- Sums: \( [1+8+4+10], [8+4+10+2], [4+10+2+7], [10+2+7+5], [2+7+5+9], [7+5+9+3], [5+9+3+6] \)
- Sums: \( [23], [25], [23], [24], [24], [24], [26] \)
- Differences: \( \max(26) - \min(23) = 3 \) (Incorrect)

From the above analysis, we can see that the program does not always generate a k-level permutation because it does not control the sums of the segments effectively.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
