Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know the following at the end of the previous iteration:
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + nk`, where `n` is the total number of iterations the loop has run.
   - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + n`, where `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + n + 1`.
   - `i` is incremented `n` times and is less than `len(permutation)`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to update the state of the variables involved in the loop head:
   - `i`: This variable starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `k-1`.
   - `n`: This is the total number of iterations the loop has run, which remains unchanged within the loop.

Given that `i` is incremented `n` times and is less than `len(permutation)`, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented by 1 (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration).

4. **New State Calculation**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The total number of iterations `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` remains the same since it depends on the current value of `i` and `n`, which will change but not immediately affect this value.
- `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` remains the same for the same reason.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + nk`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + n`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i` is still less than `len(permutation)`**.
