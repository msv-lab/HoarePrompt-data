Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is `curr_v + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `curr_v += 1` increments the value of `curr_v` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` remains `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v + 1`. The updated value of `curr_v` is `curr_v + 1`.
