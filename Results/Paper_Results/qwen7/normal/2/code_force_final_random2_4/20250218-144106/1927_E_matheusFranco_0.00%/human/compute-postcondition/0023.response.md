Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 1`, and `i` is less than `len(permutation)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` to `curr_v`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially set to `i` and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is initially set to `curr_v + 1`, after the assignment, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` becomes `curr_v`. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
