Output State: `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + nk` where `n` is the total number of iterations the loop runs, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + n`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + n + 1`, and `i` is incremented `n` times and is less than `len(permutation)`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `i + nk`, where `n` is the total number of times the loop ran. The value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list will be `curr_v + n`. The variable `curr_v` will be the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + n + 1`. The variable `i` will have been incremented `n` times and will still be less than the length of `permutation`.
