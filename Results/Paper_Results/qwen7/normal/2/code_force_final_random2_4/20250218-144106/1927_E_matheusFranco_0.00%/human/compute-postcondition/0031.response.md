Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 3`, and `i` is incremented by 1 and less than `len(permutation)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` to `curr_v`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged. `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is still `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is now updated to `curr_v`, `curr_v` is still the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 3`, and `i` is incremented by 1 and still less than `len(permutation)`.
