Output State: `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + nk`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + n`, where `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `i` is `i + nk`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `i + nk`, meaning it will have incremented by `k` for each iteration, totaling `nk`. The value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list will be `curr_v + n`, indicating that `curr_v` will have been incremented by `1` for each iteration, also totaling `n`. The variable `i` will have been incremented by `1` for each iteration, so it will be `i + nk`.
