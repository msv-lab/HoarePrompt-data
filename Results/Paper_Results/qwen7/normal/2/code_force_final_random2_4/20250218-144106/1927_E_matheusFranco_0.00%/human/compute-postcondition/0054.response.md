Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `n * k`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `n + (n // k)`, `i` is `0`, `curr_v` is `n`, and `result` is a string containing space-separated values from the `permutation` list starting from the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` up to the end.**

Explanation: The code snippet `result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])` joins all elements of the `permutation` list into a single string with each element converted to a string and separated by spaces. Since the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `n * k` and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `n + (n // k)`, the `result` string will contain the values from the `permutation` list starting from the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to the end. The variables `i` and `curr_v` retain their initial values of `0` and `n`, respectively.
