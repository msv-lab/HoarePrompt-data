Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 3k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is `curr_v + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Initially, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was `i + 2k`. After adding `k`, the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `i + 3k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
