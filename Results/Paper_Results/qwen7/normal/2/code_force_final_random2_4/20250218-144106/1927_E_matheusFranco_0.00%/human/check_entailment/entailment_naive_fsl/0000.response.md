Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a k-level permutation for all possible inputs. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 2`. According to the problem description, a valid k-level permutation should satisfy the condition that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length `k` is at most 1.

The current implementation generates the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4]` for `n = 4` and `k = 2`. Let's check the sums of continuous segments of length `k`:

- Sum of the first segment: `1 + 2 = 3`
- Sum of the second segment: `2 + 3 = 5`
- Sum of the third segment: `3 + 4 = 7`

The maximum sum is 7 and the minimum sum is 3, so the difference is `7 - 3 = 4`, which violates the k-level condition.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for generating a k-level permutation for all potential cases.
