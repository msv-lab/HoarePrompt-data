Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The precondition that `t` is an integer is maintained, and the values of `n` and `k` are not yet defined as they depend on the subsequent input for each test case.
