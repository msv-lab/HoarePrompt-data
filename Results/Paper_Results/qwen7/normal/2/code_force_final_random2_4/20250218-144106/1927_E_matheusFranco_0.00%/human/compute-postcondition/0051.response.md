Output State: `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + nk`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + n`, where `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `i` is `0` (or the initial value of `i`), and `curr_v` is `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `k` multiplied by the total number of iterations (`nk`). The value stored in `permutation` at the index specified by `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `curr_v` plus the total number of iterations (`curr_v + n`). The variable `i` will retain its initial value (which is `0` in the given context), and `curr_v` will be equal to the total number of iterations (`n`).
