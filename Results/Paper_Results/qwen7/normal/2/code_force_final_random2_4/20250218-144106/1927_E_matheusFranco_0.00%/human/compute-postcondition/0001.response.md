Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `t > 0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**: The current state is that `t` is an input integer.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is not greater than 0 (i.e., `t` is 0 or negative), the loop will not execute even once.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
