Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n.
2. A k-level permutation is defined such that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.
3. Function `func_1` is designed to generate a permutation based on a specific pattern. However, the pattern used in `func_1` does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will be k-level. Instead, it seems to distribute numbers in a repeating sequence, which might not satisfy the k-level condition.
4. Function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1` for each test case.

To verify correctness, we need to check if `func_1` can produce a k-level permutation. Let's analyze `func_1` more closely:
- It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` filled with zeros.
- It iterates over a range from 0 to `k-1`, placing values starting from 1 up to `n` in the list at positions that are multiples of `k` plus the current iteration index.
- This approach does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` will have a difference of at most 1.

Given this analysis, let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate why `func_1` might fail:
- For `n = 4` and `k = 2`, `func_1` generates `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- The sums of continuous segments of length 2 are `[1+2, 2+3, 3+4]`, which are `[3, 5, 7]`.
- The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is `7 - 3 = 4`, which violates the k-level condition.

Since `func_1` does not guarantee a k-level permutation and fails in certain cases, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
