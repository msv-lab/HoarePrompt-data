### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summaries step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to generate a k-level permutation of length n.
- A permutation is k-level if the maximum difference between the sums of any two continuous segments of length k is at most 1.

#### Function Summaries Recap:
- `func_2` processes multiple test cases. It reads `t` (number of test cases), then for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, calls `func_1`, and decrements `t`.
- `func_1` constructs a permutation of length `n` based on the value of `k`.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: 
   ```python
   (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
   permutation = [0] * n
   idx = 0
   idx_v = 1
   curr_v = 1
   ```
   - `permutation` is initialized as a list of zeros of length `n`.
   - `idx` is the index in the permutation list.
   - `idx_v` is used to keep track of the next value to be assigned.
   - `curr_v` starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each value added to the permutation.

2. **Filling the Permutation**:
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
       while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
           permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
           curr_v += 1
           multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
   ```
   - The loop runs `k` times.
   - In each iteration, it assigns values starting from index `i` and incrementing by `k` until the end of the list.
   - This ensures that every `k` consecutive elements in the permutation will have the same value.

3. **Output**:
   ```python
   result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
   print(result)
   ```
   - Converts the permutation list to a string with space-separated values and prints it.

#### Verification:
- Consider the example given in the problem description: `n = 4` and `k = 2`.
  - The generated permutation is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - Segments of length `k` are `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` and `[3, 4]`.
  - Sums are `1 + 2 = 3`, `2 + 3 = 5`, and `3 + 4 = 7`.
  - The maximum sum is 7 and the minimum sum is 3, resulting in a difference of 4.
  
- However, the problem requires the difference to be at most 1. The current approach does not guarantee this.

#### Correctness Check:
- The original assessment correctly points out that the current implementation does not ensure the k-level condition.
- The generated permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4]` for `n = 4` and `k = 2` fails the k-level condition because the difference between the sums is 4.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
