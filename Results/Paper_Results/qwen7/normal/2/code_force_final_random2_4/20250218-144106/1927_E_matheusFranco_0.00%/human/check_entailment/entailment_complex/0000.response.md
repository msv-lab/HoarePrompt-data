Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the standard input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length \( n \) with all zeros.
   - It then iterates over the range from 0 to \( k-1 \). For each iteration, it places values starting from 1 up to \( n \) in the list at positions that are multiples of \( k \) plus the current iteration index.
   - After completing these iterations, it prints the contents of the `permutation` list as a space-separated string.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads an integer \( t \) representing the number of test cases.
   - It then processes each test case by calling `func_1()`, decrementing \( t \) after each call until \( t \) is less than or equal to 0.
   - This ensures that all test cases are processed.

3. **Problem Description and Constraints**:
   - The problem requires constructing a \( k \)-level permutation of length \( n \).
   - A \( k \)-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length \( k \) is no more than 1.
   - The provided solution constructs a permutation where each block of \( k \) consecutive numbers is placed in a way that satisfies the \( k \)-level condition.

4. **Verification**:
   - The constructed permutation in `func_1` ensures that each block of \( k \) consecutive numbers is unique and covers all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - This construction inherently satisfies the \( k \)-level condition because the sums of any two blocks of \( k \) consecutive numbers will differ by at most 1 due to the sequential placement of numbers.

Given the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the required logic to generate a \( k \)-level permutation for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
