Output: **m + p (where m is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original s and p is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s)**

Explanation:
- `t` is greater than 0 but its value is not needed for the print statement.
- `i` is 0 but it is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer but it is not used in the print statement.
- `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
- `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`. Since all occurrences of 'map' have been removed from `s`, `m` is 0.
- `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

The print statement `print(m + p)` will therefore print the sum of `m` and `p`. Given that `m` is 0, the output will be the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, which is represented by `p`.

Thus, the output is `m + p`, where `m` is 0 and `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
