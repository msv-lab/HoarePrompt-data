Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in range(t)`. This means the loop variable is `i` and the control variable is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop)
   - `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed
   - `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`
   - `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is determined by the initial input and does not change within the loop.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (unchanged from the previous state)
   - `i` must be 1 (incremented by 1 from the previous state)
   - `n` remains an input integer (unchanged from the previous state)
   - `s` remains the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed (unchanged from the previous state)
   - `m` remains the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s` (unchanged from the previous state)
   - `p` remains the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s` (unchanged from the previous state)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`**
