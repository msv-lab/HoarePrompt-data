Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `s` is updated to remove all occurrences of 'map', `n` is an integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `m = s.count('map')` counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s` and assigns the count to the variable `m`. The string `s` itself is updated to remove all occurrences of 'map', but its new value is not specified, only that it no longer contains 'map'. All other variables remain unchanged.
