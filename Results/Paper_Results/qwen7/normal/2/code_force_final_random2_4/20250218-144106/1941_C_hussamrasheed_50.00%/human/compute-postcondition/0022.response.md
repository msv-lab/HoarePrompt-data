Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` must be a positive integer, `i` will be equal to `t-1`, `n` will be an input integer for each iteration, `s` will be the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed for each iteration, `m` will be the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s` for each iteration, `p` will be the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated `s` for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will still hold the initial value of the input integer, but `i` will now be one less than `t`. For each of the `t` iterations, `n` will contain the integer input for that iteration, `s` will be the string input without any 'map' substrings, `m` will be the count of 'map' in the original `s`, and `p` will be the count of 'pie' in the modified `s`.
