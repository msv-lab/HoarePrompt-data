Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is updated to remove all occurrences of 'map'**.

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. This updates the value of `s` to the new input string, while all other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 and `i` is 2 are still valid. The values of `n`, `m`, and `p` are also preserved, with `m` representing the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, and `p` representing the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated `s` (after removing 'map').
