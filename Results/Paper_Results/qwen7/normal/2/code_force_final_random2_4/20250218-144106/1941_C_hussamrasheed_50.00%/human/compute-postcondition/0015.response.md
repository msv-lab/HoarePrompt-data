Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed
   - `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`
   - `p` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated `s`
   - `s` is updated to remove all occurrences of 'map'
   - `p` equals the count of 'pie' in the updated `s`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - Therefore, `t` must be greater than 1.

Given these points, we need to update the state such that `i` is incremented by 1 and `t` is greater than 1.

**Final State**:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer (unchanged)
- `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed (unchanged)
- `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s` (unchanged)
- `p` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated `s` (unchanged)

**Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated `s`**
