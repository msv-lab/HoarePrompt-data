Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is updated to remove all occurrences of 'map'**.

Explanation: The code `m = s.count('map')` counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`. This value is stored in the variable `m`. The string `s` itself is updated to remove all occurrences of 'map', but the updated `s` is not re-assigned to a new variable name, so the original `s` is modified. All other variables remain unchanged.
