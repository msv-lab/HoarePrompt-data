Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated `s`, `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated string `s`.**

The code updates the variable `p` to be the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` after all occurrences of 'map' have been removed. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
