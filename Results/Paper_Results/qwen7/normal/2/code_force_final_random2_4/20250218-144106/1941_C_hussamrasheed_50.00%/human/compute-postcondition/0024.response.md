Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a string `s`. It then counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`, removes all instances of 'map' from `s`, counts the occurrences of 'pie' in the modified `s`, and prints the sum of these two counts. This process is repeated for `t` test cases, where `t` is also provided as input.**
