Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a string input by the user.
- `results` is a list containing at least one element.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i)
```

Here, `i` is not explicitly defined or mentioned in the initial state. Since no value or definition for `i` is provided, we cannot determine its value from the given information. Therefore, the output will depend on how `i` is defined elsewhere in the code, which is not specified in the initial state.

Given the lack of information about `i`, the most precise description we can provide is that `i` is some undefined variable.

Output: **i**
