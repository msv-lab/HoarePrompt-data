Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user**.

The code `arr = input()` assigns the string input by the user to the variable `arr`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
