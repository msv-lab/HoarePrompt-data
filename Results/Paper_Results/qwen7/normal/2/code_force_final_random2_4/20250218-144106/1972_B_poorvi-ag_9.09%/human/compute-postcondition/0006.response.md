Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is a list containing 'no', `i` is 0, `n` is an even number, `arr` is the string input by the user.**

The code `results.append('no')` adds the string `'no'` to the list `results`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
