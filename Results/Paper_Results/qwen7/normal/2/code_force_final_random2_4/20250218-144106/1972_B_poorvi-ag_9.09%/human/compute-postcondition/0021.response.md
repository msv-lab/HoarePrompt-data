Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `i` is 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user**.

Explanation: The code `arr = input()` assigns the value of the user's string input to the variable `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
