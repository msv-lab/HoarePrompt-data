State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
3. Before the loop starts, `t` must be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive to ensure the loop can execute at least once.
4. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` must be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is an empty list, and `i` is 0.
