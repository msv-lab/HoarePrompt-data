Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `results`.

2. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list. The variable `i` is iterating over the elements of `results`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an input integer (this does not change within the loop).
   - `arr` is a string input by the user (this does not change within the loop).
   - `results` is a list containing at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the elements of `results`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value of the last element in `results`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two elements, and `i` will take the value of the second-to-last element in `results`.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `n` remains the same (unchanged from the previous iteration).
- `arr` remains the same (unchanged from the previous iteration).
- `results` must now contain at least two elements, and `i` will take the value of the second-to-last element in `results`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is the second-to-last element in the list `results`**.
