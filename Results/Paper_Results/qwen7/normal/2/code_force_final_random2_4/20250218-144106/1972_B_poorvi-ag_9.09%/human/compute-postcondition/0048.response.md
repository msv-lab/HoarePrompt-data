Output State: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration based on the conditions described, and `i` is 0 since the loop runs from 0 to `t-1` where `t` is the length of `results`.

In Natural Language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, `n` remains as the input integer, `arr` remains as the string input by the user, and `results` is a list that contains 'yes' or 'no' for every iteration of the loop. The variable `i` will be 0 because the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`, where `t` is the final length of the `results` list, which is equal to the number of times the loop executed.
