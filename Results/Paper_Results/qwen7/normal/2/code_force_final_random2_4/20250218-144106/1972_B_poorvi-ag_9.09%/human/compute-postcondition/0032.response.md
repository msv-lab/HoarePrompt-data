Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing 'no'**.

The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is still 3, `n` retains its input integer value, `arr` keeps the string input by the user, and `results` now contains the string `'no'`.
