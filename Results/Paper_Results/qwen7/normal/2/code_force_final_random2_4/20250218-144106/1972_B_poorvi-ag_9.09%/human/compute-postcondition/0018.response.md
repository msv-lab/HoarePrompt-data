Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, and depending on whether `n` is even or odd and the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', `results` will contain 'yes' or 'no'.
