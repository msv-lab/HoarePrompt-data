#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 99 (since the loop runs from 0 to t-1), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, and `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration based on the condition. If `n` is even, `results` contains 'no'. Otherwise, if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', `results` contains 'yes' and either 'yes' or 'no'. If the count of 'D' is greater than or equal to the count of 'U', `results` contains 'no'.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration based on the conditions described, and `i` is 0 since the loop runs from 0 to `t-1` where `t` is the length of `results`.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, `n` remains as the input integer, `arr` remains as the string input by the user, and `results` is a list that contains 'yes' or 'no' for every iteration of the loop. The variable `i` will be 0 because the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`, where `t` is the final length of the `results` list, which is equal to the number of times the loop executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 100), a positive integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100), and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if it's possible to flip some "U" to "D" or vice versa so that the total count of "U" and "D" becomes balanced (i.e., the counts of "U" and "D" are equal). If it's possible, it appends "yes" to the results list; otherwise, it appends "no". Finally, it prints the contents of the results list, which contains "yes" or "no" for each test case.
