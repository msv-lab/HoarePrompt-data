Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no'.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `arr` is the string input by the user.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must remain the same because `t` is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`results`, `n`, and `arr`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition. Therefore, they remain unchanged.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

**Final State**:
- `t` remains the same (an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive).
- `i` becomes 3.

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 3**.
