Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input to extract the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. This part is implemented correctly using `list(map(int, input().split()))`.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**: The program checks if Bob's initial position (`x2`) is less than or equal to Alice's initial position (`x1`). If this condition holds, it immediately prints "draw" and returns. This logic is correct and matches the problem statement.

3. **Odd Difference Check**: When the difference between Bob's and Alice's row positions is odd, the program checks if Alice can force a win. This involves moving Alice's chip to a position where she can capture Bob's chip. The logic here seems to handle the case where Alice and Bob are on the same column but different rows correctly.

4. **Even Difference Check**: When the difference between Bob's and Alice's row positions is even, the program checks if Bob can force a win. Similar to the odd case, it involves moving Bob's chip to a position where he can capture Alice's chip. The logic here also seems to handle the case where Alice and Bob are on the same column but different rows correctly.

5. **Edge Cases and Boundaries**: The program handles edge cases such as when Alice or Bob's moves would go out of bounds. These checks are implemented correctly to ensure the game does not proceed with invalid moves.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result ("Alice", "Bob", or "draw") and does not return any value, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the game outcome based on the initial positions and the rules provided.

Correctness: **True**
