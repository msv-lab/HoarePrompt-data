Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `a` is `m - y1` if `y2` is less than `y1`, otherwise `a` is `y1 - 1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, and the condition `(x2 > x1 and x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n)` is true, and `y1 > y2`
