The function processes input coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) to determine the winner of a game between two players, Alice and Bob. It reads six integers from input representing these coordinates and the dimensions of a grid (h, w). Based on the relative positions of the coordinates and certain conditions, it prints either "Alice", "Bob", or "draw" and does not return any value.
