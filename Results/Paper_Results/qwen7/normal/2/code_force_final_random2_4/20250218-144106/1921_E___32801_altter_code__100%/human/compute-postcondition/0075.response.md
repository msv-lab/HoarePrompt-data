Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is 1, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `a` is `m - y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`**.

Explanation: The value of `y1` is explicitly set to 1. All other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state. Since `y1` was previously less than or equal to `y2`, and now `y1` is set to 1, `t` is recalculated as `abs(y2 - y1)`, which means `t` is now `abs(r[5] - 1)`.
