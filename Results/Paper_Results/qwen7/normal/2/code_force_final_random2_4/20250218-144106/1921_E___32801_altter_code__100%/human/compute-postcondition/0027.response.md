Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is either r[2] + 1 or r[2], `y1` is either r[3] + 1 or r[3] - 1, `x2` is r[4], `y2` is r[5], `x2` is greater than `x1`, and (x2 - x1) is odd, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is x2 - x1.**

Explanation: The code `b = x2 - x1` calculates the difference between `x2` and `x1` and assigns it to `b`. Since `x2` is greater than `x1` and their difference is odd, `b` will be an odd number. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
