Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is either 1 or `m`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is adjusted based on the condition `y1 <= y2`, `a` is `m - y1` if `y2` is less than `y1`, otherwise `a` is `y1 - 1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, and `c` is `m - y2` if `y2` is less than `y1`, otherwise `c` is `r[5] - m`. Additionally, the following conditions hold: `b // 2 ≤ a`, `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, or `y1 > m`, or `1 > y1`, or `m < x1`, or `n < x1`.
