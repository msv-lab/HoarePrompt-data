Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `a` is `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, otherwise `a` is `m - y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`. The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.
