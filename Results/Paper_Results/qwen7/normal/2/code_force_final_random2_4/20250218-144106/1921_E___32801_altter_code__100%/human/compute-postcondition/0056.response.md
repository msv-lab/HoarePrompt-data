Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is `r[0]`.
- `m` is `r[1]`.
- `x1` is `r[2]`.
- `y1` is `r[6]`.
- `x2` is `r[4]`.
- `y2` is `r[5]`.
- \((x2 - x1) \% 2 == 0\), meaning the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.
- The current value of `y1` is equal to `y2`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'bob'`.

Output: **'bob'**
