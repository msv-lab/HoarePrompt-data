Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `a` is `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, otherwise `a` is `m - y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`**

Explanation: The code `x2 -= a` subtracts the value of `a` from `x2`. The value of `a` is determined based on the condition involving `y2` and `y1`. After the subtraction, `x2` is updated to `x2 - a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
