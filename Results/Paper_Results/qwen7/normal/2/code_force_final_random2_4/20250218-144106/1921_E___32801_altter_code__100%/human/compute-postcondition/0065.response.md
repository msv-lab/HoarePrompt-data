Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `a` is `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, otherwise `a` is `m - y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` to be the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition for `a` and `b` remains the same as before the code execution.
