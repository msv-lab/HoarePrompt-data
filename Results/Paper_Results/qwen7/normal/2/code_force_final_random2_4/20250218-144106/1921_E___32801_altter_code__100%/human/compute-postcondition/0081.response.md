Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `m`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `m`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `m + (m - y1)` if `y2` is less than `y1`, otherwise `m + (y1 - 1)`, `a` is `m - y1` if `y2` is less than `y1`, otherwise `a` is `y1 - 1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, and the condition `(x2 > x1 and x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n)` is true.**

Explanation:
- The code `y2 += a` increments `y2` by the value of `a`.
- Given the conditions, `a` is defined as `m - y1` if `y2` is less than `y1`, otherwise `a` is `y1 - 1`.
- After the increment, `y2` becomes `m + (m - y1)` if `y2` was less than `y1`, or `m + (y1 - 1)` if `y2` was not less than `y1`.
