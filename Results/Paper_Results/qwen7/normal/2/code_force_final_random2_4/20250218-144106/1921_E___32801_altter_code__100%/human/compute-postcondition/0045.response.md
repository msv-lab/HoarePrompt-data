Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2] + 1 or r[2] + a, `y1` is either r[3] + 1 or r[3] - 1, `x2` is r[4] - a, `y2` is m, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and (x2 - x1) is odd, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `t` is abs(r[5] - r[3]), `x2` is greater than or equal to x1, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to n, `y2` is greater than `y1`, `y1` is increased by a, `c` is m - y1**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `m - y1` to `c`. Since `y1` was previously either `r[3] + 1` or `r[3] - 1`, and now it is increased by `a`, the new value of `y1` is either `r[3] + 1 + a` or `r[3] - 1 + a`. Therefore, `c` is calculated as `m - (r[3] + 1 + a)` or `m - (r[3] - 1 + a)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
