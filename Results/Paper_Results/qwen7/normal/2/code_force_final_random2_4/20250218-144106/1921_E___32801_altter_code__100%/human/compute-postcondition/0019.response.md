Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is `r[0]`.
- `m` is `r[1]`.
- `x1` is either `r[2] + 1` or `r[2]` depending on the condition.
- `y1` is either `r[3] + 1` or `r[3] - 1` depending on the condition.
- `x2` is `r[4]`.
- `y2` is `r[5]`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- `(x2 - x1)` is odd.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `y1` is equal to `y2`.

Despite the conditions on `x1`, `y1`, and the contradiction between `y1` being equal to `y2` and `y1` not equal to `y2`, the key point is the `print` statement itself. The statement `print('Alice')` will simply print the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
