Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is r[0], m is r[1], x1 is r[2] + 1, y1 is r1 + 1, x2 is r[4], y2 is r[5], x2 is greater than x1, and (x2 - x1) is odd, and y1 is not equal to y2, and the current value of y2 is greater than y1**

Explanation: The value of `x1` is incremented by 1, making it `r[2] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions involving these variables are still valid as per the initial state.
