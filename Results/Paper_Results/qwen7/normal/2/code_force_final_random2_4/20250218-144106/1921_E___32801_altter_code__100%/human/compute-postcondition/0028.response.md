Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is either r[2] + 1 or r[2], `y1` is either r[3] + 1 or r[3] - 1, `x2` is r[4], `y2` is r[5], `x2` is greater than `x1`, and (x2 - x1) is odd, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `t` is abs(r[5] - r[3]).**

Explanation: The code assigns the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` to `t`. Since `y2` is `r[5]` and `y1` is either `r[3] + 1` or `r[3] - 1`, the value of `t` is `abs(r[5] - r[3])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
