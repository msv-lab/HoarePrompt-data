### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case using `list(map(int, input().split()))`. This part is correct.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if Bob's initial position (`x2`) is less than or equal to Alice's initial position (`x1`). If true, it immediately prints 'Draw'. This is correct according to the rules.

3. **Odd Difference Check**:
   - If the difference between Bob's and Alice's initial row positions is odd, the program checks if the initial column positions are the same. If true, it prints 'Alice'. This is correct because Alice can always force a win by moving diagonally towards Bob's column. However, the implementation of this check is somewhat convoluted and could be simplified.

4. **Even Difference Check**:
   - If the difference is even, the program performs more detailed checks to determine the winner. These checks involve moving Alice and Bob's positions and calculating distances to determine if Alice can force a win. However, the current implementation has several issues:
     - The logic for updating positions and checking distances is complex and not fully aligned with the game rules.
     - The conditions for determining a win or draw are not clearly defined and may lead to incorrect outcomes.
     - The program does not handle all edge cases properly, such as when Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board without capturing the opponent's chip.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, it does not account for scenarios where Alice or Bob might reach the boundary of the board without capturing the opponent's chip.

### Detailed Analysis:

Let's break down the detailed checks for even differences:

- The program attempts to move Alice and Bob's positions in a way that simulates their movements, but the logic is overly complex and may not accurately reflect the game rules.
- The conditions for determining a win or draw are not clearly defined and may lead to incorrect outcomes. For example, the program checks if `b // 2 > a` and `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c`, but these conditions are not directly related to the game rules.
- The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For instance, it does not consider scenarios where Alice or Bob might reach the boundary of the board without capturing the opponent's chip.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identified that the detailed checks for even differences are overly complicated and may not accurately reflect the game rules. The program also does not handle all edge cases properly. Therefore, the program is not correct as it stands.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program needs to be revised to ensure it correctly implements the game rules and handles all edge cases appropriately.
