Postcondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is r[0], m is r[1], x1 is either r[2] + 1 or r[2] (depending on the condition), y1 is either r[3] + 1 or r[3] - 1 (depending on the condition), x2 is r[4], y2 is r[5], x2 is greater than x1, and (x2 - x1) is odd, and y1 is not equal to y2.**
