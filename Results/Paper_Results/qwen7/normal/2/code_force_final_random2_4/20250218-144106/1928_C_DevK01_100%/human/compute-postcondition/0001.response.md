Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, `w` is the square root of `q`, and the list `M` is an empty list.**

In this case, the code calculates the square root of `q` and assigns it to the variable `w`. Since `q` is an integer, `w` will be its square root. The values of `q`, `x`, and the list `M` remain unchanged.
