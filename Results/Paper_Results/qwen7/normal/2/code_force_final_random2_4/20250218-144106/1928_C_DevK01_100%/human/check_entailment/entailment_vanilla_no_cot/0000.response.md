Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**: The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, but according to the problem statement, the formula should be `y = 2 * n - x`. This is because the position `x` is adjusted based on the total number of positions `n`.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic**: The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`. However, the logic within the function is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:` is unnecessary and incorrect. Also, the logic for adding divisors to the list `M` is not correctly implemented.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is very close to `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    y = 2 * n - x
    ans = 0
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    y //= 2
    w = math.isqrt(y)
    if w * w == y and w >= x - 1:
        ans += 1
    for i in range(1, w + 1):
        if y % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                ans += 1
            if y // i >= x - 1:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the logic for calculating `y` is correct, and the function to find divisors works as expected.
