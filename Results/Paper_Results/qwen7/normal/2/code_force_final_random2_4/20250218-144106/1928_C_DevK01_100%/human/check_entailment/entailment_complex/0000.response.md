### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining how many values of \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) fit the given constraints for a specific position \( n \) and number \( x \) received by Vasya during the settling process.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya help in determining possible values of \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find divisors of \( q \) (which is derived from \( n + x \)) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - These divisors represent potential values of \( k \) because the settling pattern involves divisors of \( 2k - 2 \).

4. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program correctly calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with appropriate arguments to find valid \( k \) values.
   - The logic for handling the divisors and ensuring they meet the required conditions is correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0 immediately.
   - The logic for including additional divisors when \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) is correctly implemented.

6. **Mathematical Consistency**:
   - The use of the square root and divisor checking ensures that only valid \( k \) values are considered.
   - The conversion of results to a set and counting unique values is correct.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values based on the given constraints. There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in the code.

### Correctness:

**True**
