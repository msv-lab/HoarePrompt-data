Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit into the described settling pattern. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern can be broken down into segments of length \( k \), where the sequence of numbers assigned to the positions is cyclic.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must align with one of these segments.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even. If not, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - The function `func_1` is used to find valid \( k \) values based on the conditions derived from the problem statement.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function calculates potential \( k \) values by finding divisors of \( q = y - 2 \).
   - It includes \( w = \sqrt{q} \) in the list if it meets the condition \( w \geq x - 1 \).
   - It iterates through all integers from 2 to \( w \) and adds those that are divisors of \( q \) and meet the condition \( i \geq x - 1 \) or \( q // i \geq x - 1 \).

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the divisors of \( q \) that fit the required conditions.
   - The main loop in the annotated program correctly processes each test case and uses `func_1` to find valid \( k \) values.
   - The output is the count of unique valid \( k \) values, which matches the problem requirements.

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
