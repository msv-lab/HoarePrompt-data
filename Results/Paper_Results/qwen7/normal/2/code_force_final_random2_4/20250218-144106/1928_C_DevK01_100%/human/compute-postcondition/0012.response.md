Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, the list `M` contains the elements `w` and `i`, `q` is divisible by `i`, and `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Initially, `M` contains the element `w`. Since `i` is 1, `M` now contains both `w` and `1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
