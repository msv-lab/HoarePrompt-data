Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, the list `M` contains the elements `w`, `i`, and `q // i`, `q` is divisible by `i`, and the value of `i` remains the same since `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `q // i` to the list `M`. Given that `q` is divisible by `i` (which is 1), `q // i` is simply `q`. Since `i` remains unchanged, the updated list `M` now includes `w`, `i`, and `q`. The conditions regarding `w`, `q`, and `i` remain the same.
