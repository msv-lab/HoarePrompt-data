The function accepts two parameters, `q` (an integer representing Vasya's position in the line) and `x` (an integer representing the number Vasya received). It calculates the square root of `q` and checks for divisors of `q` within the range from 2 to the square root of `q`. If a divisor meets certain conditions (specifically, being greater than or equal to `x - 1`), it is added to the list `M`. Finally, the function returns the list `M` containing these divisors.
