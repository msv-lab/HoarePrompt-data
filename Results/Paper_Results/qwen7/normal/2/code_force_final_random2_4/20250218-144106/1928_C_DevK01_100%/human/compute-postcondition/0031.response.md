The variables in the loop head are `i` and `w`, so we can only adjust these two variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < w`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be less than `w` and greater than 2, and `M` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still satisfy the condition `i < w`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `w` and greater than 3 after the increment.

State: **`i` is increased by 1 and is less than `w`, `i` is greater than 3, `M` remains unchanged**
