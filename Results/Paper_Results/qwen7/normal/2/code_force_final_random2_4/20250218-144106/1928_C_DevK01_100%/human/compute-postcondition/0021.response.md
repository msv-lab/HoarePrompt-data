Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < w`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line
   - `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling
   - `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1
   - The list `M` contains the elements `w` and `i`
   - If `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `i` remains the same and `M` contains `i`. If `q` is not divisible by `i`, the conditions remain unchanged.

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition depends on the variable `i` and `w`.
   - Since `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, `w` is already determined by `q` and does not change within the loop.
   - Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted to allow the loop to execute one more time is `i`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `w`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must be incremented to a value less than `w`.

Given that `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, and `i` is currently 2, we need to ensure that `i` can be incremented to a value less than `w`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be less than `w` and `i` must be greater than 2**
