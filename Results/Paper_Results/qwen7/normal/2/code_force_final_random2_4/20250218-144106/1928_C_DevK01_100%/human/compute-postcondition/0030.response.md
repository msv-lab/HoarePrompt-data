Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `i` must be less than `w` and greater than 2, M remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The conditions for `i` (it must be less than `w` and greater than 2) still hold true after the increment. Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, `M` remains unchanged.
