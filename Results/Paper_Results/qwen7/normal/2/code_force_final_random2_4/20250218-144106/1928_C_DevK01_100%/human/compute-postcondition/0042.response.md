Output State: `i` is greater than or equal to `w`, `q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than or equal to 2, the list `M` contains the elements `w` and all integers `i` from 2 to `w` (inclusive) that satisfy the conditions inside the loop, and if `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` also contains `q // i`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be set to the next integer greater than `w`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The list `M` will contain `w` and all integers from 2 to `w` that divide `q` and meet the specified conditions, along with any additional divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
