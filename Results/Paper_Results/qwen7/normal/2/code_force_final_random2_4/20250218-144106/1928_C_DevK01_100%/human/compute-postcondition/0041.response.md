Output State: `i` is equal to `w`, `q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than or equal to 2, the list `M` contains the elements `w` and all integers `i` from 2 up to and including `w` that satisfy the conditions within the loop, and `M` will also include `q // i` if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `w`, which is the square root of `q`. The list `M` will contain `w` and all integers from 2 up to `w` (inclusive) that divide `q` without a remainder and are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Additionally, `M` will also include `q // i` for each divisor `i` of `q` that meets the criteria.
