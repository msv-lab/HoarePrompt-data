Output State: **`a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers, `p` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `p`, `res`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
