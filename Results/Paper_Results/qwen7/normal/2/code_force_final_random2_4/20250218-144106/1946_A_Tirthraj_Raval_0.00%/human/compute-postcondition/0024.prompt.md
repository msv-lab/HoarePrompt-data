Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
    res = a.count(a[p])
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `p` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1; `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `p` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `res` is updated to the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers created from input, `p` is now (n + 1) // 2 - 1, `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `res` is updated to the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
