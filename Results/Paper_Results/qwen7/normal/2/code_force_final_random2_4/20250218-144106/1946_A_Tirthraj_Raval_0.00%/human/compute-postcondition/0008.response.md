Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `p` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
   - `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(res)`, which means it will print the value of `res`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the value of `res`:

- Since `a` is sorted, `p` will point to the middle element if `n` is odd, or the element just before the middle if `n` is even.
- `res` counts how many times the element at index `p` appears in the list `a`.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `res` without knowing the specific elements in the list `a`. However, we can describe what `res` represents:

Output: **the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p` (where `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` and `n` is the length of the list `a`)**
