Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since the initial state of `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, after sorting, `a` will be a sorted version of that list. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
