Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The program simply counts the occurrences of the element at the median position after sorting the array, which does not address the problem's requirement to minimize the number of operations.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2 2 8
```

The program will output `1`, but according to the problem description, the correct output should be `1` because we can increase the first element to `3` to make the median `3`. However, the program's logic does not account for this possibility.

Similarly, for the input:

```
4
7 3 3 1
```

The program will also output `1`, but the correct output should be `2` because we need to increase both the first and third elements to `4` to make the median `4`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases.
