Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers created from input, `p` is now (n + 1) // 2 - 1, `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `res` is updated to the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`.**

Explanation: The code `res = a.count(a[p])` updates the variable `res` to be the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`. The other variables remain unchanged.
