Postcondition: **`k` is updated to the original value of `k` minus `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `y` is `n - 1 - i`. Otherwise, `i` is `n - 1`, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is now `a[i + 1]`, and `rem` is `0`.**
