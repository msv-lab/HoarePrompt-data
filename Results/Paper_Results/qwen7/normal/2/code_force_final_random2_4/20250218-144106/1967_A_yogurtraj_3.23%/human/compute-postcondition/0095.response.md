Output State: **`k` is an integer, `r` is undefined, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `m` is the input value, `n` is the integer input from the second line, `k` is the integer input from the second line, `a` is a list of sorted integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`k`, `r`, `ii`, `m`, `n`) remain unchanged. The list `a` now contains its elements sorted.
