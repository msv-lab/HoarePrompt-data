Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, and `rem` is `0`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to be the sum of `a[i]` and `k` divided by `i + 1`. Here, `i` is `n - 1`, so `r` becomes `a[n - 1] + k // (n - 1 + 1)`, which simplifies to `a[n - 1] + k // n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
