Postcondition: **`y` is either `n - 1 - i` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, or `0` otherwise. `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is either `a[n - 1] + k // n` if `k` is non-zero, or `a[i + 2]` if `k` is zero, and `k` is a non-negative integer.**

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts. It includes the conditions for `y`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, `r`, and `k` as described in the respective parts of the if-else statement.
