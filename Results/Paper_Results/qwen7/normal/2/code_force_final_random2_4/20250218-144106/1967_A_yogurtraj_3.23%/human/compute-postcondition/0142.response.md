Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a set of inputs including an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100), followed by t test cases. Each test case includes two integers n and k (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), and a list of n integers a (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12). For each test case, the function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function handles multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a list of integers, and returns a result for each test case without needing to specify the parameters directly within the function definition.
