Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is adjusted based on whether the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is met. If the condition is true, `r` is set to `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 2`, and `k` is set to 0. If the condition is false, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.
