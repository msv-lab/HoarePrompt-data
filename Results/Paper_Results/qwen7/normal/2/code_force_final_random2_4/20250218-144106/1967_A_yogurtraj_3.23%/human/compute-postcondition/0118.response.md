Output State: **`i` is 1; `k` is `k` minus `(2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])`; `r` is `a[2]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to `r`. Given that `i` is 1, `r` is assigned `a[2]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. The expression `(2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])` is evaluated but not explicitly modified in the given code snippet; it is part of the calculation for `k` in the initial state description.
