Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the range function parameters.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be less than `n-1`.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `y` is 0 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `ii` is the new value obtained from `int(input())`, but this is not used in the loop.
   - `n` is an integer equal to the input integer.
   - `k` is an integer equal to the input integer (not relevant to the loop).
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `input().split()` (not relevant to the loop).
   - `r` is equal to `a[0]` (not relevant to the loop).
   - `rem` is 0 (not relevant to the loop).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The loop will start when `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, we need to ensure `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 0.

**State:**
**`n` must be greater than 0**
