Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. The list a contains n integers a_i such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of cards of each type initially.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `y` is either `n - 1 - i` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, or `0` otherwise. `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is either `a[n - 1] + k // n` if `k` is non-zero, or `a[i + 2]` if `k` is zero, and `k` is a non-negative integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is an integer. If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is set to `a[n-1] + k // n`. If `k` is equal to 0, then all iterations of the loop have completed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is an integer. If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is the sum of `a[n-1]` and `k` divided by `n`. If `k` is equal to 0, then all variables retain their values from the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
