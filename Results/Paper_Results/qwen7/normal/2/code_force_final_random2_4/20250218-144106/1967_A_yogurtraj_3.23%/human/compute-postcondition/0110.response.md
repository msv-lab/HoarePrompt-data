Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is `a[i + 1]`.
