Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Analyze the given postcondition**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `k` is either decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` if the condition is false, or `k` becomes 0 if the condition is true.
   - `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`.
   - `y` is `n - 1 - i`.
   - The innermost loop or if statement is broken if `k` is 0.

4. **Determine the new values at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` could be updated based on the condition, but we don't know the exact value without the loop body. However, we know that if `k` becomes 0, the loop breaks.
   - `rem` is calculated as `0 % (i + 1)`, so it will be `0` since `rem` is always `0 % (i + 1)`.
   - `y` is updated to `n - 1 - (i + 1)`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `k` could be updated, but we don't know its exact value.
   - `rem` is `0`.
   - `y` is updated to `n - 1 - (i + 1)`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `k` is unknown, `rem` is `0`, `y` is `n - 1 - (i + 1)`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we leave it as unknown.
