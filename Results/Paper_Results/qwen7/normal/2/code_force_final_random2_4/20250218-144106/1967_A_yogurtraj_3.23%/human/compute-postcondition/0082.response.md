Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`.
