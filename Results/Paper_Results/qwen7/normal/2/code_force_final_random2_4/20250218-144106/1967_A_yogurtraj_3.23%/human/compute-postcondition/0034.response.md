Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is `a[n]` (if `n` is within bounds), and `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Given that `i` was initially `n - 1`, after executing the line `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `i` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
