Output State: **`k` is reduced by ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])), `i` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. The values of `k`, `i`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
