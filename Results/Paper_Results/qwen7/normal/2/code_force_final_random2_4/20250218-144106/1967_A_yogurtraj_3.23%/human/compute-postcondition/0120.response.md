Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `k` is adjusted based on the value of `i` and the elements of array `a`. If `i` is 2 and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[2] + 0 // 3`, `rem` is `0 % 3`, `y` is `n - 3`, and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `k` is `k` minus `(2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])`, and `r` is `a[2]`.
