Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2.**

This means that the variable `bxsfory` is now assigned the value of `math.ceil(y / 2)`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
