Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is 1, `x` is an input integer from the first input split, `y` is an input integer from the second input split. If `x > 0` and `y == 0`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
