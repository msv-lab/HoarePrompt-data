Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `x` and `y`. The values of `t`, `ap`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
