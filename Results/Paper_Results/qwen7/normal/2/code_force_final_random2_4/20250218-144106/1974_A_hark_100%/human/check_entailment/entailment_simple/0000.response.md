Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given code step-by-step to ensure it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the icons.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: 
   - The function `func_1()` reads the number of test cases (`ap`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Handling Different Cases**:
   - If both `x > 0` and `y > 0`:
     - Calculate `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`, which represents the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the grid.
     - Update `x` to account for the space taken by these 2x2 icons: `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
     - Calculate `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of `x / 15`, which represents the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - Print `bxsfory1 + bxsfory` as the total number of screens required.
   - If `x == 0` and `y > 0`:
     - Directly calculate the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - If `x > 0` and `y == 0`:
     - Directly calculate the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons: `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - If neither `x` nor `y` is greater than 0:
     - Print `0` as no screens are needed.

3. **Calculation Verification**:
   - The logic for handling the 2x2 icons seems correct because each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and the remaining space is calculated accordingly.
   - The calculation for the 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons also appears correct, as each 1x1 icon takes up 1 cell, and the remaining space is divided by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells).

Given the above analysis, the code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required for placing the icons.

Correctness: **True**
