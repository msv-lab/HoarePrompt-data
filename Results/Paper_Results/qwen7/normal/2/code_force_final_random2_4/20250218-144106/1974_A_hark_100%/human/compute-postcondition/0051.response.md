Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the values of \(x\) and \(y\). If both \(x > 0\) and \(y > 0\), it calculates \(x\) as \(x - \text{ceil}(y / 2) \times 15 + y \times 4\) and prints \(\text{ceil}(x / 15) + \text{ceil}(y / 2)\). If \(x == 0\) and \(y > 0\), it prints \(\text{ceil}(y / 2)\). If \(x > 0\) and \(y == 0\), it prints \(\text{ceil}(x / 15)\). If neither condition is met, it prints \(0\). The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
