Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is 1, `x` is `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is an input integer from the second input split, `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. Here, `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`. The other variables (`t`, `ap`, `k`) remain unchanged.
