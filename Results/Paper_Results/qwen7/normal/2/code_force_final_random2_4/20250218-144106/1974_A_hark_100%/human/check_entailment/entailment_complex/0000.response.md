Reasoning:

The program aims to calculate the minimum number of screens required to place the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a grid. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Case 1:** Both \(x > 0\) and \(y > 0\)
   - The formula \(x = x - \text{ceil}(y / 2) \times 15 + y \times 4\) adjusts \(x\) based on the number of 2x2 icons placed.
   - \(\text{ceil}(y / 2)\) represents the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the grid.
   - \(\text{ceil}(x / 15)\) represents the number of 1x1 icons that can fit into the remaining space.
   - The total number of screens is \(\text{ceil}(x / 15) + \text{ceil}(y / 2)\).

2. **Case 2:** \(x == 0\) and \(y > 0\)
   - Only 2x2 icons need to be placed.
   - The number of screens required is \(\text{ceil}(y / 2)\).

3. **Case 3:** \(x > 0\) and \(y == 0\)
   - Only 1x1 icons need to be placed.
   - The number of screens required is \(\text{ceil}(x / 15)\).

4. **Case 4:** Neither \(x > 0\) nor \(y > 0\)
   - No icons need to be placed.
   - The number of screens required is \(0\).

Given the logic and the example provided, the program correctly implements the solution for each test case. The calculations and conditions match the problem statement and the examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
