Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `bxsfory` * 15 + `y` * 4, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0 else the ceiling of `x` divided by 15. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `ap`, `k`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
