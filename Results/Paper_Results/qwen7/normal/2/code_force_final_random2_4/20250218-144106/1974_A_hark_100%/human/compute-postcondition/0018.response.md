Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is an input integer.
- `k` must be between 0 and `ap` - 1 (inclusive).
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- Either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is greater than 0.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(0)
```

This statement will print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
