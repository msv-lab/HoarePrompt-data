Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved, which are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` because `i` starts at `1` and goes up to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` generates numbers from 1 to n-1).

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mak` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `i` is 2
   - The input string is `<`

4. **Determine the Next Values**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is 2, the loop will run again if `i` is incremented to 3 and `n` remains greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 (and thus greater than 3 to allow another iteration).

6. **Final States**:
   - `mak` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `i` changes to 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`mak` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**.
