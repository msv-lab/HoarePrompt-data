Output State: **`mak` is 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `mak` is reassigned to 0, overriding its previous value which was equal to `len(pans)`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was previously set to an input integer. The execution of `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables, so it is not included in the output state.
