Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `pans` must have at least 2 elements, but no specific values are provided for these elements.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Given the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. However, since `pans` must have at least 2 elements, we can assume `mak` refers to one of the indices within the range of the list `pans`.

Since `pans` has at least 2 elements, let's denote the elements as `pans[0]` and `pans[1]` (assuming the simplest case where `pans` has exactly 2 elements).

The print statement will then print:
- `'?'` (a question mark).
- `pans[mak]` (which could be either `pans[0]` or `pans[1]` depending on the value of `mak`).
- `pans[mak]` again.
- `pans[i]`, which is `pans[1]` since `i` is 1.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[1]]' (where pans[mak] is one of the elements in pans and pans[1] is the second element in pans)**
