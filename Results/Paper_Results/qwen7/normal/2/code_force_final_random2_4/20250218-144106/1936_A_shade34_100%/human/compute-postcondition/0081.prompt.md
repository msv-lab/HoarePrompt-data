Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mak` is 0, the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the last input received (either '<' or '='), and `pans` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `s` was equal to '<', with the last index added to `pans` being `n-1` if `s` was '='.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mak` is equal to `i`, `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed, and a string read from input is either greater than '>' or the input operation completes without further changes to variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mak` is equal to `i`, a string read from input is either greater than '>', or the input operation completes without further changes to variables, `len(pans)` must be greater than `i`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `mak` is equal to `i + 1`, a string read from input is either greater than '>', or the input operation completes without further changes to variables, `len(pans)` must be greater than `i + 1`. If the input string is '>', then `mak` becomes `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
