Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so `mak2` is also `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `mak` is `n`.
- `pans` is an empty list, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Given the values:
- `mak` is `n`.
- `mak2` is `n`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

So, the print statement will output:
Output: **? n n n-1 n**
