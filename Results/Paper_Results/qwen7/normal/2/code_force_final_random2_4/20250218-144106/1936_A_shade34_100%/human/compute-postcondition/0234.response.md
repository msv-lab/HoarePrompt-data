Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `mak` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-2`, and `n-1`, and `s` is the input string from `input()` after the loop completes.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will decrement from `n-1` to `0`. Therefore, `i` will be `0` at the end. The value of `mak` remains `n` throughout the loop. The value of `mak2` remains equal to `mak`, which is `n`. The list `pans` collects all the values of `i` where the input was `'='`. Since the loop runs `n` times, `pans` will contain the last three values of `i` (which are `n-1`, `n-2`, and `n-1`) if the input was `'='` for those iterations. The final state of `s` will be the input received when `i` is `0`.
