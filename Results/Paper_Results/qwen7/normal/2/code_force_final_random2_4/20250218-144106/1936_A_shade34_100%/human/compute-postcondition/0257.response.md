Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `len(pans) - 1`, and it is given that `i` is now 3, meaning `len(pans)` is 4.
- `mak` is equal to `i`, so `mak` is also 3.
- `pans` remains unchanged and has at least 2 elements, but since `i` is 3, `pans` must have at least 4 elements.

The print statement is:
```python
print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak` is 3.
- `pans[mak]` would be the fourth element of the `pans` list because `mak` is 3.

However, the value of `mak2` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since no other information is provided about `mak2`, we cannot determine its value precisely. Therefore, we will leave it as `mak2`.

Given this, the output will be:
Output: **! mak2 pans[mak] (where pans[mak] is the fourth element of the list pans)**
