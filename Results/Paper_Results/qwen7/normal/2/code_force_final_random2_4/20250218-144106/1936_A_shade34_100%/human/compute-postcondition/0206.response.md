Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the element `n-1`, `s` is a string input from the user and is not equal to `<`, and the current value of `s` is equal to `'='`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `i` (which is `n-1`) to the list `pans`. Since `i` was previously `n-1`, appending it to `pans` results in `pans` now being a list with one element, which is `n-1`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
