Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mak` is 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, and `s` is the last string input by the user, which is either '<' or '=' depending on whether the condition `s == '<'` was met in the if part during the last iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `len(pans)` is at least 1, `pans` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, `mak` is `i`, and the user inputs '>' which sets `mak` to `i`. If the user does not input '>', `mak` remains `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `len(pans)` is at least 1. If the input string is `'>',` then `mak` is 2. If the input string is not `'>',` then the values of `i`, `len(pans)`, and `mak` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `mak` retains its previous value, and `len(pans)` is at least 1, as `str(input())` being equal to '>' does not change these conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
