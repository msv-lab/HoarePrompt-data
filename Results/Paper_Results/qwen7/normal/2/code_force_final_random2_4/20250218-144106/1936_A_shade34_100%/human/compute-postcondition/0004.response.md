Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is explicitly given as 0.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, but its specific value is not given.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but its specific value is not given.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, so it must be a variable that is being referenced in the print statement but not initialized or defined elsewhere in the given context.

Given this information, we know the values for `mak` and `i` (which is not defined but will be printed as `i`), but `t` and `n` are not explicitly defined and their values are not needed to determine the exact output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Since `mak` is 0, and `i` is referenced but not defined, the output will include these values as they are. The string `'?'` will also be printed as part of the statement.

Output: **'? 0 0 i i'**
