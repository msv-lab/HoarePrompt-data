Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 0.
- `n` must be at least 1, but its exact value is not specified.

The variables `mak` and `mak2` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their values. Therefore, they will be printed as they are, without any further evaluation.

Output: **'? mak mak2 0 mak2'**
