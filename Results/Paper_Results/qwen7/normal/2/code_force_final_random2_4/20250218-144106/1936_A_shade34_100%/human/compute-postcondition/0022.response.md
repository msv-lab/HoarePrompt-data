Output State: `mak` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `mak` ≤ n-1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. After all iterations of the loop, `mak` will be set to the value of `i` if the input for that iteration is '<'. If the input is not '<' for any iteration, `mak` will remain 0.

This means that `mak` will hold the value of the last `i` for which the input was '<', or it will be 0 if no such `i` exists. The value of `t` and `n` will remain as they were initially, with `n` being greater than 0 and `t` being between 1 and 10^3.
