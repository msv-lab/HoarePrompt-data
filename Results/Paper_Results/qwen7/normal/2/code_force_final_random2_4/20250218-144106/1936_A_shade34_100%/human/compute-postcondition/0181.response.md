Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `mak` is 1 (though `mak` is not involved in the loop condition).

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is 1, it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - To allow the loop to execute, `n` must still be greater than 1, but since it was already greater than 1, it remains the same.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `mak` remains 1 (unchanged).

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `mak` is 1**.
