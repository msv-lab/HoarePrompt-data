Output State: **`i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing 1, `s` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to the variable `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` and `mak` both have the value 2, while `n` is still greater than 1, `mak2` is still `n-1`, `pans` remains a list containing 1, and `s` is still the input string from the user.
