Output State: **`mak` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 2**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered data is written to the standard output immediately. Since no variables are modified by this line of code, the values of `mak`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.
