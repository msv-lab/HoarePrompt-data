Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. This means the loop variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `mak2` is equal to `n-1`
   - `pans` is a list containing 0
   - `s` is the string input by the user, which is either equal to '<' or '='

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue.
   - `mak2` will be updated to `n-1` again, but since `n` remains the same, `mak2` will still be `n-1`.
   - `pans` and `s` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not change for the next iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing 0, `s` is the string input by the user, which is either equal to '<' or '='**
