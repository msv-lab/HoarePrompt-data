Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `mak` is 0
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - If the input is less than 0, `mak` remains 0 (though this condition does not affect the current state since `mak` is already 0)

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`.
   - The loop does not directly modify `t` or `mak`, but it does depend on `n`.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value less than `n`.
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `n` must remain greater than `i + 1`.

Given the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`mak` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 2**
