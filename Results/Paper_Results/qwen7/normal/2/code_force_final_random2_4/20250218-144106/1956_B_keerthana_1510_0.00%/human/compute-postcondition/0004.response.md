Output State: **`line` is set to the fifth line from standard input; `elements` is the list obtained by splitting `line` on whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `elements = line.split()` splits the string stored in the variable `line` on whitespace and assigns the resulting list to the variable `elements`. The value of `line` remains unchanged as it was set to the fifth line from standard input in the initial state.
