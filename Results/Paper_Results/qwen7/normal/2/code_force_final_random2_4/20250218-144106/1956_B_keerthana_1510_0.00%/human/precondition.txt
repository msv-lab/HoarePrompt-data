t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is given where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
