To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `line` is set to the fifth line from standard input.
   - `elements` is the list obtained by splitting `line` on whitespace.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Set `elements`:**
   - `elements` is a list obtained by splitting `line` on whitespace. This means `elements` contains all the words (or tokens) from the fifth line of standard input, separated by spaces.

2. **Set `elements.count(item) // 3`:**
   - For each unique item in `elements` (considering the set `{*elements}` to avoid counting duplicates multiple times), count how many times it appears in `elements`.
   - Divide this count by 3 using integer division (`//`).

3. **Sum the Results:**
   - Sum up all the results obtained from the previous step.

### Example Scenarios:

Let's consider an example to illustrate this process. Suppose the fifth line of standard input is:
```
apple orange apple banana orange
```

Then:
- `line = "apple orange apple banana orange"`
- `elements = ["apple", "orange", "apple", "banana", "orange"]`

Now, let's go through the code:

- Unique items in `elements` are `{"apple", "orange", "banana"}`.
- Count of each item:
  - `"apple"` appears 2 times, so `2 // 3 = 0`.
  - `"orange"` appears 2 times, so `2 // 3 = 0`.
  - `"banana"` appears 1 time, so `1 // 3 = 0`.

Summing these results: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.

### General Case:

For any input line, the code will count the occurrences of each unique word, divide by 3, and sum these results. If no word appears more than twice, the result will be zero because `count // 3` will always be zero for counts less than 3.

### Final Output:

Output: **0**
