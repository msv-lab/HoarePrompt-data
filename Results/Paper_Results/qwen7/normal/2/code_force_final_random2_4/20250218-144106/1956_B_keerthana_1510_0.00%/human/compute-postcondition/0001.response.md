Output State: **`line` is the third line (or any subsequent valid line) from standard input, `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` on whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `elements = line.split()` splits the string stored in `line` using whitespace as the delimiter and assigns the resulting list of substrings to the variable `elements`. The initial value of `line` remains unchanged, and the output state includes both the updated `elements` list and the unchanged `line`.
