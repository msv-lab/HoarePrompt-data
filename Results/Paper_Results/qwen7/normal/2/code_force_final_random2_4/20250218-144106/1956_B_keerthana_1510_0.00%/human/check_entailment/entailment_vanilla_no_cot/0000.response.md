Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function attempts to count the number of points you can get by dividing the counts of each unique element by 3, which is not relevant to the problem's rules and objectives. 

To solve this problem, you need to simulate the game and consider the optimal strategy for both players. Specifically, you should:

1. Track the cards in your hand and the cards on the table.
2. For each of your turns, determine the best card to play to maximize your score while minimizing the opponent's score.
3. Simulate Nene's optimal moves and calculate the maximum number of points you can achieve.

Here is a conceptual approach to solving the problem:

1. Create a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of each card value in your hand.
2. Simulate each of your turns by selecting the card that maximizes your score while considering Nene's optimal response.
3. Use a strategy to ensure Nene's moves are optimal (e.g., always picking the card that maximizes her score and minimizes yours).
4. Track the points you earn and return the total after all turns.

This requires a more complex algorithmic approach rather than a simple counting mechanism.
