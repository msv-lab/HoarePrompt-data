Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `v in reversed(b)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `v` and `b`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `b` when iterated over in reverse order.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `b` is a non-empty list.
   - `p` is `p * v` (where `v` is the current value being processed in the loop).
   - `ans` is a list with the element `p * v`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over the list `b` in reverse, the next value of `v` will be the next element from the end of the list `b`.
   - The list `b` will lose its last element after each iteration because it is being iterated in reverse.
   - The variable `p` will be updated to `p * v` where `v` is the current element being processed.
   - The list `ans` will be updated to include the new value `p * v`.

5. **Determine the New State**:
   - `b` will have one less element than before.
   - `p` will be updated to `p * v` where `v` is the current element being processed.
   - `ans` will have one more element, which is `p * v`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `b` will be the original list `b` minus its last element.
- `p` will be the product of all elements processed so far, which means `p` will be `p * v` where `v` is the last element processed in the previous iteration.
- `ans` will be the original list `ans` plus the new element `p * v`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`b` is a non-empty list minus its last element, `p` is the product of all elements processed so far, `ans` is a list with the element `p * v` added to the original list.**
