Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `b` is a list with an additional element `a[r]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends the element `a[r]` to the list `b`. Since the initial state does not provide the exact value of `a[r]`, we can only say that `b` now contains an additional element `a[r]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
