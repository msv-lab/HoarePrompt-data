Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
2. Specifically, the program constructs a list `b` which is supposed to represent the array `a` after removing elements according to the commands in `s`. However, the construction of `b` is incorrect because it simply copies elements from `a` without removing any elements.
3. The program then calculates the cumulative product of all elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this result as a reversed list `ans`.
4. This means the program does not actually remove elements from `a` as specified in the problem statement, and thus does not produce the correct output.

Given these points, the program is not implementing the required logic correctly.

Correctness: **False**
