Output State: `b` is an empty list, `p` is the product of all elements in the original list `b`, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative products of all elements in `b` in reverse order, starting from the product of the entire list down to the product of the first element.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `b` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The variable `p` will hold the product of all elements in the original list `b`. The list `ans` will contain the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order, starting with the product of the entire list and ending with the product of the first element.
