Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `r` is one less than its original value, and `b` is a list with an additional element `a[r]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1, making it one less than its original value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
