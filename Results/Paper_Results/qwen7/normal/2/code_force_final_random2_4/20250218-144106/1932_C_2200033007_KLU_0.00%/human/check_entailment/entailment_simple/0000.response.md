Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**: The program correctly parses the input values `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` and initializes the necessary variables.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly processes the commands in the string `s` and appends the appropriate elements from the list `a` to the list `b`.
   - However, the logic for calculating the cumulative product of the elements in `b` and appending them to `ans` is flawed. The function should calculate the product of the remaining elements in `a` after processing each command, not the elements in `b`.
   - The current implementation calculates the product of all elements in `b` and appends it to `ans`, but `b` is not updated according to the problem statement. Instead, `b` should be updated by removing elements from `a` as per the commands in `s`.

3. **Product Calculation**:
   - The product calculation should be done on the remaining elements of `a` after each command is processed, not on the elements in `b`.
   - The function should maintain a running product of the elements in `a` and append the result to `ans` after each command is processed.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly follow the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
