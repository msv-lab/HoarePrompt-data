Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list with the additional element `a[l+1]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was initially (let's call it `l_initial`) to `l_initial + 1`. Since the initial value of `l` is not specified, we denote it as `l += 1`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the list `b` remain unchanged, except for the fact that the element `a[l]` in the list `b` is now `a[l+1]` due to the increment of `l`.
