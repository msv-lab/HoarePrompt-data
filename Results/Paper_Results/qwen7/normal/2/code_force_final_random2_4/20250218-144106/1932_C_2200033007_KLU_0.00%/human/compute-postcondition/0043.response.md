Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` based on the directions given in `s`, then calculates the cumulative product of all elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this result as a reversed list `ans`.**
