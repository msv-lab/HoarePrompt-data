Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `b` is a list.

3. **Loop Body Effects**:
   - If `s[i]` equals 'L', then `b` is a list with an additional element `a[l+1]`.
   - Otherwise, `r` is one less than its original value, and `b` is a list with an additional element `a[r]` appended to it.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer and does not change within the loop body.
   - The effect of the loop body on `b` depends on the value of `s[i]` (which is `s[2]` now). However, since the exact value of `s[2]` is not given, we cannot determine the exact changes to `b`. But we know that `b` will have an additional element appended to it based on the condition.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `b` will have an additional element appended to it, but the exact content of `b` cannot be determined without knowing `s[2]`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list with an additional element appended to it.**
