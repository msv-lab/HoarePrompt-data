Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a reversed list `ans` containing the cumulative product of all elements in the original list `b`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first.**

Note: The description assumes that the original list `b` is derived from the list `a` and the string `s`, but the exact derivation process is not specified in the given information.
