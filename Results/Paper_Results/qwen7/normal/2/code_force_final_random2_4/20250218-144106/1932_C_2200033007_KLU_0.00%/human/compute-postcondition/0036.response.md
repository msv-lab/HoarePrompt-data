Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `b` is a non-empty list minus its last element.
   - `p` is the product of all elements in `b` multiplied by `v`.
   - `ans` is a list with the element `p * v` added to the original list, and `ans` now has an additional element `p`.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates over `v` in `reversed(b)`. This means `v` takes the values from the last element of `b` to the first element of `b` in reverse order.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was the second-to-last element of `b`.
   - For the next iteration, `v` will be the last element of `b` (the one that was removed in the previous iteration).

4. **Updating `b`**:
   - Since `v` is the last element of `b` at the start of the next iteration, `b` will be the list without its last element (which is `v`).

5. **Updating `p`**:
   - `p` is the product of all elements in `b` multiplied by `v`. After removing `v` from `b`, `p` will be the product of all remaining elements in `b`.

6. **Updating `ans`**:
   - `ans` currently has an additional element `p`. In the next iteration, `ans` will have another element added, which is `p * v`.

Given these steps, let's update the states:

- `b` will be the list without its last element (which is `v`).
- `p` will be the product of all elements in the updated `b`.
- `ans` will have an additional element `p * v` added to it.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`b` is a non-empty list minus its last two elements, `p` is the product of all elements in `b`, `ans` is a list with the elements `p * v` and `p` added to the original list**.
