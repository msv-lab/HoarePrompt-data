Output State: The `letters` list is a sorted list, `i` is equal to the length of `digits`, and `digits` is a list. No conditions inside the loop have triggered a return statement, meaning that the loop has completed all its iterations without encountering any breaking conditions. Therefore, the function has successfully iterated over all elements in `digits` (and `letters` up to index `i-1`), and no early returns have been made based on the given conditions.
