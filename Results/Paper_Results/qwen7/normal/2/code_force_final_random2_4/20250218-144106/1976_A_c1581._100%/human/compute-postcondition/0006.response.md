Output State: **The password must have at least one character, and it now includes the character `char`; `letters` is a list that has appended `char` to its existing content.**

Explanation: The code `letters.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the list `letters`. The precondition that the password must have at least one character and does not contain any digits remains unchanged. The only change is that the list `letters` now includes the character `char`.
