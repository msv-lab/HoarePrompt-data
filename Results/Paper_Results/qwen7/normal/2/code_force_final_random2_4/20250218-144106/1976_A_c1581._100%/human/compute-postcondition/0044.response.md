Output State: **`sortedPassword` is a string formed by concatenating `digits` and `letters` up to index `i-1`, `i` is equal to the length of `digits`, and `digits` is a list.**

Explanation: The code concatenates the `digits` list and the `letters` list up to index `i-1` and joins them into a single string `sortedPassword`. Since the loop has completed all its iterations without encountering any breaking conditions, the lengths of `digits` and `letters` up to index `i-1` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still equal to the length of `digits`, and `letters` remains a sorted list up to index `i-1`.
