Postcondition: `letters` is a sorted list, `i` is 2, and `digits` is a list with length greater than 2. If `i < len(digits) - 1` and `digits[i] > digits[i + 1]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the value of `i` remains unchanged and the lists `letters` and `digits` retain their original properties.
