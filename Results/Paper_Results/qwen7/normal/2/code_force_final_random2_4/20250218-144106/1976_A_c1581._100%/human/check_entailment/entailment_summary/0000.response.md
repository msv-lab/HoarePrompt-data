Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password meets the specified conditions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the validation process:

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**: The function `func_1` correctly separates the password into digits and letters.
2. **Sorting**: Both the digits and letters are sorted independently.
3. **Validation Conditions**:
   - It checks if any digit is out of order relative to other digits.
   - It ensures that no digit is greater than the last letter.
4. **Final Check**: It compares the sorted combination of digits and letters with the original password to ensure they match.

Given the execution summary and the provided example cases, the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
