Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `password` is processed such that all its digits are collected into the `digits` list, and all its letters are collected into the `letters` list; `digits` list is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `digits.sort()` sorts the `digits` list in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the `letters` list or the `password` string itself. Therefore, the `digits` list is updated to be sorted, while the `letters` list and the `password` string remain unchanged from their previous states.
