Output State: **`password` must have at least one character; `char` is the first character of `password`; `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password`.**

Explanation: The code appends the first character of `password` (which is stored in `char`) to the list `digits`. Since `char` is the first character of `password`, it is added to the list `digits`. The other variables remain unchanged.
