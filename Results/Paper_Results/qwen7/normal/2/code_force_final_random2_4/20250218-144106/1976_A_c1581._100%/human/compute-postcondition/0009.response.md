Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for char in password:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `char` and `password`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `password`. At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition was that `password` must have at least one character.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - Since the loop continues until `password` is empty, for the next iteration, `password` must have at least one fewer character than it had at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The variable `char` will be the first character of the updated `password`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `password` must have at least one fewer character than it had at the end of the previous iteration.
- `char` will be the first character of the updated `password`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`password` must have at least one character, `char` is the first character of `password`**.
