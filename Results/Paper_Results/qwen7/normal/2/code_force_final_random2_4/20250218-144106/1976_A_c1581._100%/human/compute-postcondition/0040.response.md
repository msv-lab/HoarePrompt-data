Postcondition: `letters` is a sorted list, `i` is 2, and `digits` is a list with length greater than 2. If `i < len(letters)` and `digits[-1] > letters[i]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the value of `i` remains unchanged and the lists `letters` and `digits` retain their original properties.
