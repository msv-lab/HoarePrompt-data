Output State: **The `letters` list is sorted alphabetically.**

Explanation: The code `letters.sort()` sorts the `letters` list in alphabetical order. The `digits` list remains unchanged, and the `password` variable itself is not affected. The precondition that `password` is processed such that all its digits are collected into the `digits` list and all its letters are collected into the `letters` list, and the `digits` list is sorted, still holds true. The only change is that the `letters` list is now sorted alphabetically.
