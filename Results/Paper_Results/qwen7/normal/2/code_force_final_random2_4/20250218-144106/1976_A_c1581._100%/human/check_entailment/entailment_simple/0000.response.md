Reasoning:
1. The program correctly parses the input and separates the password into digits and letters.
2. It sorts the digits and letters separately.
3. It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
4. It checks if the last digit is greater than any of the letters.
5. It constructs a sorted password from the sorted digits and letters.
6. It compares the constructed sorted password with the original password to ensure they match.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to determine if the password is strong according to the given conditions. The program structure and the function implementation are consistent with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
