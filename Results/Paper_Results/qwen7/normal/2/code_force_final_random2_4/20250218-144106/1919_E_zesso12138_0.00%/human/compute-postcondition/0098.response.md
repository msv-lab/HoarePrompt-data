Output State: **`new_dp[j - 1]' is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD', `j` is an integer and equals the previous `j + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and if `dp[j] > 0`, then either `j - 1` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, or `j + 1` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. This update is performed if `j + 1` is within the valid range.**

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state. The updated value of `new_dp[j - 1]` is now dependent on its previous value, `dp[j]`, and the modulo operation.
