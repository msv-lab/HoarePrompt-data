Output State: The final state of `dp` will be a list of length \(2n + 1\) where each element is calculated based on the cumulative sum of its adjacent elements from the previous iteration, modulo `MOD`. Specifically, for each valid index \(j\) (0 to \(2n\)), the value of `dp[j]` will be the sum of `dp[j-1]` and `dp[j+1]` from the previous iteration, taken modulo `MOD`. After all iterations, `i` will be \(n + 1\), and `new_dp` will be assigned the final values of `dp`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `dp` list will contain the values resulting from the specified update rule applied iteratively, starting from an initial condition where only `dp[n]` is 1 and all others are 0. The final `dp` list will reflect the cumulative effect of adding adjacent values from the previous state, wrapped around the list boundaries using modulo arithmetic.
