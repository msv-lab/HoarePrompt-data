Output State: `index` is increased by the sum of all `n` values encountered during the loop iterations, `t` is 0 (since it decreases by 1 each iteration and starts from a value greater than 0), `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, appended with `result` for each iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `index` will point to the position right after the last processed segment of the `data` list, `t` will be 0 as it has been decremented to zero, `p` will contain all integers from the specified segments of `data` concatenated together, `data` remains unchanged, `results` will be a list of all the results returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop.
