Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `dp[j]` is greater than 0, and either `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, in which case `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, or `j + 1` is greater than `2 * n`, in which case `new_dp[j + 1]` remains unchanged.
