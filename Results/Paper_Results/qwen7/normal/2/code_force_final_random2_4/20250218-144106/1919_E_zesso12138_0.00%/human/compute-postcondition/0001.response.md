Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace.**

The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the standard input (which would be provided by the user or another source), splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged.
