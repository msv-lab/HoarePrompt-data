Output State: **`index` is 6 + `data[5]`, `n` is an integer value equal to `data[index]`, `t` is greater than 0, `p` is now a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(data[index], p)` appended with `result`, and `results.append(result)` has been executed.**

Explanation:
- The line `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` converts the elements in the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers and assigns the resulting list to `p`.
- All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
