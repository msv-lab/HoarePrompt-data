Output State: **`index` is 4, `n` is an integer from `data[2]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is an empty list, `p` is now a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` takes a slice of the `data` list starting from `data[index]` (which is `data[4]`) and ending at `data[index + n]` (which is `data[4 + n]`). It then maps each element in this slice to an integer and assigns the resulting list to `p`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
