Output State: **`index` is 3, `n` is an integer from `data[2]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code updates `n` to the integer value of `data[index]`, where `index` is currently 2. After executing `n = int(data[index])`, `index` is incremented by 1 (since list indexing in Python moves to the next element), making `index` equal to 3. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
