Output State: `dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 filled with zeros except for `dp[n]` which is 1, `i` is 1, `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 where each element is updated based on the values in `dp`. Specifically, for every index `j` in `dp` where `dp[j]` is non-zero, `new_dp[j-1]` and `new_dp[j+1]` are updated to `(new_dp[j-1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and `(new_dp[j+1] + dp[j]) % MOD` respectively, provided the indices are within the bounds of the list.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `new_dp` will contain the cumulative sums of `dp` elements, adjusted for their respective positions, modulo `MOD`. The original `dp` list remains unchanged, with the sole non-zero value at `dp[n]`. The variable `i` remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
