Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list of return values from `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.
- `index` is set to the initial value (which is not specified, but it doesn't affect the output since we only need to know what `res` is).
- `t` is 0.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace.

The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`. However, the value of `res` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Typically, `res` could be one of the elements in the `results` list, but without more context about how `results` is populated, we cannot determine the exact value of `res`.

Given the information, we can infer that `res` is likely to be one of the elements in the `results` list, but we do not have enough details to pinpoint which specific element it is.

Output: **res (where res is an element in the results list)**
