Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `m` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 1 and `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` is still valid.
