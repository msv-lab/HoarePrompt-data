Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0; `l` must be non-empty; `a` is an input integer with the current value of `a` being greater than or equal to 2; `b` is an input integer; `s` is the element at index `b-1` of list `p` and its current value is greater than or equal to twice the length of the sub-list from index `a-1` to `b-1` of list `p`; `s` is decreased by the element at index `a-2` of list `p` if `a - 2 >= 0`.
