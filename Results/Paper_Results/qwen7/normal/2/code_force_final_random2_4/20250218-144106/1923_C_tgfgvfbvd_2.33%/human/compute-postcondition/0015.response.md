Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m):`. The variables involved here are `_` (a dummy variable) and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: We know that `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, and `p` is a list containing all cumulative sums of `l`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than 0. If `m` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: Since the loop depends on the value of `m`, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the other variables**: The variables `c` and `p` are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `m` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
