Output State: **`m` is 0, `a` is `input_integer - (number_of_iterations + 1)`, `b` is `input_integer - (number_of_iterations + 1)`, `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. Since `m` was initially set to 0, it remains unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `s` are not affected by this input operation. Therefore, their initial states remain the same. `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user.
