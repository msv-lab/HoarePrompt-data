Output State: **`c` is increased by the next element in `l`, `p` is equal to the new value of `c` and a list containing the value of `c` + the next element in `l`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p.append(c)` adds the current value of `c` to the list `p`. Initially, `p` contains the value of `c` plus the next element in `l`. After appending `c` to `p`, `p` will contain two elements: the original value of `c` plus the next element in `l`, and the current value of `c`. The value of `c` itself is increased by the next element in `l`, and `p` now includes both the updated value of `c` and the original sum of `c` and the next element in `l`.
