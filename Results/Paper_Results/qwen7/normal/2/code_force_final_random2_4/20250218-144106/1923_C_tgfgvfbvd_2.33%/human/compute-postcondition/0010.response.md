Output State: **`c` is increased by `x`, `l` must not be empty (still containing at least one element), `p` is equal to the new value of `c`, `p` is now a list containing the value of `c`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `c` was previously increased by `x`, its new value is stored in `p`. The conditions that `l` must not be empty and `p` is equal to the new value of `c` remain valid.
