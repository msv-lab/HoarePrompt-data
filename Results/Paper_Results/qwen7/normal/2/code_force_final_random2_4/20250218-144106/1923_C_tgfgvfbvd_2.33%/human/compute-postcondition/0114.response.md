Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in l:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `l`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`. In each iteration, `x` takes the value of the current element being processed.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `l` is the list without the first element.
   - `c` is the sum of the elements in `l` starting from the second element.
   - `p` contains the value of `c`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `x` is iterating through the list `l`, in the next iteration, `x` will take the value of the next element in `l`.
   - After processing each element in `l`, `l` will eventually become an empty list if all elements are processed.
   - `c` is the sum of elements starting from the second element, so after processing each element, `c` will be updated accordingly.
   - `p` will hold the value of `c` after each iteration.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `l` will lose its first element in each iteration until it becomes empty.
   - `c` will be updated as the sum of the remaining elements in `l`.
   - `p` will hold the value of `c` after each iteration.

Given that the loop continues as long as `l` is not empty, the next state will be when `l` has one fewer element, and `c` is updated to include the new element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` is the list without the first two elements; `c` is the sum of the elements in `l` starting from the second element; `p` contains the value of `c`**.
