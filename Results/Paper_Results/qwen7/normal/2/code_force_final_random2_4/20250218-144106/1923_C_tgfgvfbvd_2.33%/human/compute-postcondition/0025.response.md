Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer that has been decreased by 1.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `s` is calculated as the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus the element at index `a - 2` of the list `p`.
- The condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))` is true.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to 1.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs a string without referencing any variables, the output will be exactly as written in the print statement.

Output: **YES**
