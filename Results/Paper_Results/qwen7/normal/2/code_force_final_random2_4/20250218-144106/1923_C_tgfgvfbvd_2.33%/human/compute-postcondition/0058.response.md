Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer and decreased by the number of iterations, `b` is an input integer, `c` is increased by `x`, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `m * p[a - 2]`, `n` is an input integer, the list `l` must have at least one element, and the list `p` now contains the element `c`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `p` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `p` now contains the single element `c`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
