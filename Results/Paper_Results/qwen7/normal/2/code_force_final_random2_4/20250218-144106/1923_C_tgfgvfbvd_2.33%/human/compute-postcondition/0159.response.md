Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it calculates the sum of a specified sublist of the list and checks if this sum is at least twice the length of the sublist. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each query.**
