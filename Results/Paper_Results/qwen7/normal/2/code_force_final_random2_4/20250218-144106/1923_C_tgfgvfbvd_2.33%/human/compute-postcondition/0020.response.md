Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer and decreased by 1, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus the element at index `a - 2` of the list `p`, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `s -= p[a - 2]` subtracts the value of `p[a - 2]` from `s`. Since `a` is initially greater than or equal to 2, `a - 1` is now greater than or equal to 1. The precondition that `a` is greater than or equal to 2 is updated to `a` being greater than or equal to 1 because `a` is decremented by 1. All other conditions remain unchanged.
