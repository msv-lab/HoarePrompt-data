Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer and decreased by the number of iterations, `b` is an input integer, `c` is increased by `x`, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `m * p[a - 2]`, `n` is an input integer, the list `l` must have at least two elements, and the list `p` now contains the element `c` and `c` is increased by `x`.**

Explanation: The code `c += x` increases the value of `c` by `x`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
