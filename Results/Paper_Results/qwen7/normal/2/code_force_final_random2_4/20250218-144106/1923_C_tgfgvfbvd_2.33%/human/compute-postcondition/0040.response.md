Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer and decreased by 1, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `p[a - 2]`, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to -1. This holds true regardless of whether the condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is met or not.
