Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer and decreased by the number of iterations, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `m * p[a - 2]`, `n` is an input integer, and the list `l` is updated with integers from the input, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `2 - m`, and the input integer for the loop is still greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `l`. The other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `a` is greater than or equal to `2 - m` and the input integer for the loop is still greater than 0 remains valid.
