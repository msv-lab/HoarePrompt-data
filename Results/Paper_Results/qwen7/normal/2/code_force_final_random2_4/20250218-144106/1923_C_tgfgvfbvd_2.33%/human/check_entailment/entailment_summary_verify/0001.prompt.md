You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = []
        c = 0
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it calculates the sum of a specified sublist of the list and checks if this sum is at least twice the length of the sublist. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each query.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `c` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `c` of length `n`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and stores them in the list `p`. This is done using a loop where it iterates through the array `c`, accumulating the sum at each step and appending it to `p`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the start index `a` and end index `b` of the subarray.
   - It computes the sum of the subarray `c[a-1]` to `c[b-1]` using the prefix sums stored in `p`.
   - Specifically, it calculates `s = p[b-1] - (p[a-2] if a > 1 else 0)` to get the sum of the subarray.
   - The program checks if the sum `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray (`2 * (b - a + 1)`), which is a necessary condition for the subarray to be "good" based on the problem statement.

4. **Output:**
   - If the condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is satisfied, the program prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Verification Against Problem Constraints and Requirements

- **Sum Condition:** The program correctly checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the subarray to be "good".
- **Non-equality Condition:** The program does not explicitly check if `a_i != b_i` for every index, which is another requirement for the subarray to be "good". However, since the problem specifies that the sum must be at least twice the length, and the elements must be positive, this condition is implicitly handled.
- **Positive Elements:** The problem states that each element of the array `c` is greater than 0, so the prefix sums and the sum of the subarray will always be positive.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the necessary condition for a subarray to be "good" based on the provided problem description. It checks the sum condition and handles the input and output as specified.
