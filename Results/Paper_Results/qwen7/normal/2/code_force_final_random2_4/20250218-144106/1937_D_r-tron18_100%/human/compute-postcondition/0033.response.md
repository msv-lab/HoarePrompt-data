Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[i]`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to the value of `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. However, since the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are dependent on the values of `suffZero[-1]`, `suffZero[-2]`, `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`, and `n`, these values remain unchanged in the output state. All other variables retain their initial states.
