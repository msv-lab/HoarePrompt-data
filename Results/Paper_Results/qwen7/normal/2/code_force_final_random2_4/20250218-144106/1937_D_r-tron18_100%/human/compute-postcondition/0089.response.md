Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is updated to the list with its last element plus `i` plus 1, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is updated to the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is 2 times the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`, `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `ans[i]` to the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged except for `ans`, which is updated based on the given expression.
