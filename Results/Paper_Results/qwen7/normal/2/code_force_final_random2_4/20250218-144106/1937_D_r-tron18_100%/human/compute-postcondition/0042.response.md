Postcondition: `el` is equal to `s1[i]`. If `el` is '>', then `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is shortened by removing the last element, `ans[i]` is calculated as follows: if `ol <= zr`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is not '>', then `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to the value of `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, then `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Otherwise, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, and `zr` is greater than `ol`.
