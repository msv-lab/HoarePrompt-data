### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the problem statement.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \).
   - Each cell contains either '<' or '>' indicating the direction of movement.
   - A pinball starts at each cell and moves according to the direction indicated until it leaves the grid.
   - The goal is to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function computes the difference between the last element of a list `arr` and an element at a specific index determined by `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
   - The purpose of this function seems to be to handle some specific calculations related to the indices and values in the list.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` and calculates the time for a pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - It uses several variables:
     - `pre`: List of positions where the direction changes from '<' to '>'.
     - `totalOne`: Total number of positions where the direction changes from '<' to '>'.
     - `preOne`: Accumulated sum of positions where the direction changes from '<' to '>'.
     - `suffZero`: List of suffix sums of positions where the direction changes from '>' to '<'.
     - `ans`: Array to store the results for each starting position.

4. **Key Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates backward through the string `s1` and calculates the time for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - It uses the `func_1` function to compute specific values based on the accumulated sums and positions.
   - The logic involves balancing the counts of '<' and '>' to determine the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The function prints the array `ans`, which contains the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Initialization and Preprocessing**:
  - The preprocessing steps in `func_2` correctly identify the positions where the direction changes and accumulate the necessary sums.
  - The logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid appears to be sound and consistent with the problem statement.

- **Backward Iteration**:
  - The backward iteration through the string `s1` ensures that the time taken for each starting position is calculated correctly.
  - The use of `func_1` to handle specific index-based calculations is appropriate and aligns with the problem requirements.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases where the number of '<' and '>' changes might affect the calculation of the time taken.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
