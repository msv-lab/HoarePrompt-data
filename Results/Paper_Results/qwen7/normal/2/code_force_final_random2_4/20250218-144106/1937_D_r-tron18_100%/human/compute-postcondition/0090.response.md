Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is updated to the list with its last element plus `i` plus 1, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is calculated as 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` - `func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is unchanged, `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `zeroInd` is updated to the value of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The function `func_1` is called twice with different arguments, but since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot simplify the expression further.
