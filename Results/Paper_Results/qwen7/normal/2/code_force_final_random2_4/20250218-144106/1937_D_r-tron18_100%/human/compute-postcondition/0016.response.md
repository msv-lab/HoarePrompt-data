Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[i]` and is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `(ol > zr)`; `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`**.

This means that the variable `zeroInd` has been assigned the value `2 * suffZero[-1]`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
