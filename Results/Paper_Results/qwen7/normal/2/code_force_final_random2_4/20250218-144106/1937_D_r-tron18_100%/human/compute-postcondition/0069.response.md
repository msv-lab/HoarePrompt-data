Postcondition: **`el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` and `preOne` are unchanged except when certain conditions are met, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated based on different conditions, `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` is either 3 or 4 depending on the condition.**

This means that after the if-else block executes:
- `el` remains equal to `s1[1]`.
- `totalOne` does not change.
- `suffZero` and `preOne` may change under specific conditions:
  - If the condition `ol <= zr` is true in the if part, `preOne` has its last element removed.
  - If the condition `len(suffZero) - 1 <= totalOne` is true in the else part, `suffZero` becomes `[suffZero[-1] + 3]`.
- `ans` does not change.
- `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated based on different conditions:
  - If `ol <= zr` in the if part, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated as specified.
  - If `len(suffZero) - 1 <= totalOne` in the else part, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated as specified.
- `fi` and `n` remain unchanged.
- `i` becomes 3 if the if condition is true, or 4 if the else condition is true.
