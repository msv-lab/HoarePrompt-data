Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is unchanged, `preOne` is unchanged (except the last element is removed), `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated differently based on the condition `ol <= zr`. If `ol <= zr`, then `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `ans[2]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is 2 times the last element of `suffZero`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, 1) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, `i` is 3, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. `fi` and `n` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the conditions provided.
