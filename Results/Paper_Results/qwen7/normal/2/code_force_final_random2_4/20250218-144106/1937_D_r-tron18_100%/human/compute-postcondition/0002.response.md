Output State: **`s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `t` is the number of test cases such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `pre` is a list of integers where each element is (i + 1) for every index i where s1[i] == '>'; `totalOne` is the length of the list `pre`; `preOne` is a list obtained by taking the prefix sum of the list `pre` with an initial value of 0.**

Explanation: The code `preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))` calculates the prefix sum of the list `pre` and stores it in `preOne`. The `accumulate` function adds up the elements of `pre` starting from an initial value of 0. The values of `s1`, `t`, `pre`, and `totalOne` remain unchanged.
