Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n`. It calculates and stores the difference between the count of zeros and ones for each position in the string based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters. The final state of the program includes an array `ans` containing these differences for each position in `s1`, and the updated states of `pre`, `totalOne`, and `preOne`. The function prints the array `ans`.**
