Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is now `[suffZero[-1] + 3]`, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is now `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is now 2 * `func_1(preOne, zr)`, `fi` is unchanged, `i` is 4 (since `i` was incremented from 3), `n` is unchanged, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ans[4]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 4.
- `ans[i]` is assigned the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. However, since `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are defined in terms of other variables, we keep them as expressions rather than specific values unless we know their exact values.
