Postcondition: `el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is now `[suffZero[-1] + 3]`, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are updated differently based on the condition, `fi` is unchanged, `i` is 4, `n` is unchanged, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `len(suffZero) - 1` is less than or equal to `totalOne`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1([suffZero[-1] + 3], totalOne + 1) - func_1([suffZero[-1] + 3], 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`.
