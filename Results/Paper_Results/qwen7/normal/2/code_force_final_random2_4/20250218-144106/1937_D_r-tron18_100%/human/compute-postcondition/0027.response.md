Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[i]`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to the value of `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`**.

Explanation: The code appends to the list `suffZero` a new element which is the previous last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `suffZero` and `i`, the only thing we can say for certain is that `suffZero` now includes this new value. The variables `el` and `s1[i]` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `el` still is not equal to '>' as per the initial condition.
