Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is unchanged, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is unchanged, `i` is 2, `ans[2]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, `n` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` updates the value of `ans[2]` (since `i` is 2) to the result of `zeroInd - oneInd`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
