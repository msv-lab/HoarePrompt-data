Postcondition: `el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` remains unchanged, `suffZero` is updated to the list with its last element plus `i` plus 1, `preOne` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated based on the condition: if `zr <= ol`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is 2 times the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the value of `zeroInd - oneInd`, `zeroInd` is calculated as 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` - `func_1(suffZero, 1)`, and `oneInd` is updated to 2 * `preOne[-1]`. `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, and `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
