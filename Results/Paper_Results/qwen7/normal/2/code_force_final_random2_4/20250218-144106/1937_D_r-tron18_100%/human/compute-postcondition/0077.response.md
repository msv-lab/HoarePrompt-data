Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` and `preOne` are unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is equal to `2 * (len(suffZero) - 1)`, `oneInd` is equal to `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `oneInd` by calling the function `func_1` twice with different arguments. The first call uses `preOne` and `zr` as arguments, and the second call uses `preOne` and `zr + 1` as arguments. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we keep it in its functional form. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
