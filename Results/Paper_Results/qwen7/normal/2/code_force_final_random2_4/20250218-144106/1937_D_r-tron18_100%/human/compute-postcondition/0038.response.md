Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[i]`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to the value of `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, and `zr` is greater than `ol`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `zeroInd` using the formula `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, and then assigns `zeroInd - oneInd` to `ans[i]`. The values of `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, `oneInd`, and `func_1` remain unchanged except for the last element of `suffZero` which is updated. The variable `ans` now contains the calculated value for `ans[i]`.
