Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, x and n are the integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is an integer between 1 and 10^3. The values of `x` and `n` are updated to the integers provided by the user, with the condition that `1 ≤ n ≤ x` being maintained.
