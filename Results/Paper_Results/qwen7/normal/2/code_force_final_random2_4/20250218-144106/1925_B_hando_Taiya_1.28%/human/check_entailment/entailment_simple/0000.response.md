Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
3. The function `func_1()` is defined to calculate the maximum balance of the problemset.
4. Inside `func_1()`, it initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance found.
5. It then iterates over all integers from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive).
6. For each integer `i` in this range, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
7. If `x` is divisible by `i`, it checks two conditions:
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
8. After the loop, it prints the value of `ans`, which is the maximum balance of the problemset.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program correctly implements the solution to find the maximum balance of the problemset. The approach of iterating up to the square root of `x` and checking divisibility ensures efficiency while covering all possible divisors.

Correctness: **True**
