Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not called properly within the loop. It should be called with the appropriate arguments.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program correctly reads the values of `x` and `n` for each test case.

4. **Finding Maximum Balance:**
   - The program attempts to find the maximum balance by iterating through potential divisors of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i` of `x`, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, it updates the answer `ans` with the maximum value between `ans` and `i`.
   - It also checks the condition where `n` is less than or equal to `i`, updating `ans` with the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum balance found for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- The function `func_1()` is defined but not called correctly within the main loop. The call to `func_1()` should be inside the loop that processes each test case.
- The logic for finding the maximum balance seems correct, but the implementation of the function `func_1()` needs to be called properly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from math import isqrt

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(x, n)

def func_1(x, n):
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has an issue with calling the function `func_1()`. Once this is corrected, the program should work as intended.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
