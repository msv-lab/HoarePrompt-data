Output State: **`ans` is `x // i`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is `x // i`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is now updated to `x // (i + 1)`. However, the initial value of `ans` was 0, so `ans` will be set to `x // i` if `x // i` is greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
