Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum balance of the problemset. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the maximum balance. Specifically, the program checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` and `i`, but it does not ensure that the balance is maximized. 

For example, consider the test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  10 3
  5 5
  420 69
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  1
  6
  ```

- Actual Output (using the provided program):
  ```
  2
  1
  7
  ```

For the third test case (420 69), the program outputs 7, which is incorrect. The correct maximum balance should be 6, as we can split the problem into 69 sub-problems each with difficulty 6. 

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the GCD of the difficulties is maximized. One way to do this is to check all possible divisors of `x` and ensure that the number of sub-problems `n` can be evenly distributed among these divisors.
