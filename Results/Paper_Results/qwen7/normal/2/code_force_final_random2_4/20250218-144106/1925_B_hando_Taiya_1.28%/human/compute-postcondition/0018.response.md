Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
   - There exists an integer `i` such that \(x \% i == 0\).
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `x` divided by `i`, then `ans` is set to the maximum of its current value (0) and `i`.
   - If `n` is greater than `x // i`, then `ans` remains 0.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but it updates `ans` based on the condition mentioned above.

4. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
   - `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` is an integer such that `n` is less than or equal to `x` divided by `i` if `ans` was updated, otherwise `ans` remains 0.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will increment `i` by 1.
   - We need to check if `i` is within the range `1` to `isqrt(x) + 1`.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` will be recalculated as `x // i`.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the condition if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ans` is 0 (since it hasn't been updated yet in this iteration).
- `t` remains the same.
- `x` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is recalculated as `x // i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is \(x // i\)**.
