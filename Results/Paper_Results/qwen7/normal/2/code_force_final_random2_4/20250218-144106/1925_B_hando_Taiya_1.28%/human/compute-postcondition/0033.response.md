Postcondition: `ans` is the maximum of its original value (0) and `i` if `x % (i + 1) == 0` and `n` is less than or equal to `x // (i + 1)`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `i` is incremented by 1 to become `i + 1`, and `n` is `x // (i + 1)`. If `n` is not less than or equal to `x // (i + 1)`, `ans` is the maximum of its original value (0) and `x // (i + 1)`, and `i` is incremented by 1 to become `i + 1`, and `n` is `x // (i + 1)`.
