Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program correctly iterates through each test case by reading the necessary parameters (`n` and `s`) for each case.

3. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string using `s.count('U')`.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, the function returns 'YES', indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count of 'U' is even, the function returns 'NO', indicating Bob wins.

4. **Game Logic**: The logic implemented in `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the initial number of coins facing up. Since the game rules state that the player who faces up an odd number of coins wins, counting the 'U's directly corresponds to this rule.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case as required.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the implementation is correct. The function `func_1` accurately determines the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins.

Correctness: **True**
