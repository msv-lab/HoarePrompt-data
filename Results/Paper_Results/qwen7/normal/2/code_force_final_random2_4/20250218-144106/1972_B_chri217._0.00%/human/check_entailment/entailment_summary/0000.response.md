Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins.
2. The provided solution reads all inputs at once and processes them in a loop.
3. The function `func_1` checks if the number of 'U's (up-facing coins) in the string is odd.
4. According to the game rules, if there is an odd number of up-facing coins initially, Alice can always force a win by playing optimally.
5. The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies whether the number of up-facing coins is odd or even.
6. The provided examples match the expected behavior of the function.

Given the above points, the function correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of coins.

Correctness: **True**
