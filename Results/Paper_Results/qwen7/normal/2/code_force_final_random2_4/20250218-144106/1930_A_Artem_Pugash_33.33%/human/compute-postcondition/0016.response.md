Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` has at least one element less than before, `a` is the first element of `numbers` before popping, `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping, `suma` is `suma + min(a, b)` where `b` is the new value of `numbers[0]` after popping, `b` is int(numbers.pop(0))**.

This means that the first element of `numbers` has been popped and converted to an integer, stored in `b`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
