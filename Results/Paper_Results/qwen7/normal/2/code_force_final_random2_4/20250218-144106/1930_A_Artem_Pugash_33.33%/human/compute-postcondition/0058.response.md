Output State: **`numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of input integers with the first element removed, `b` is the first element of the original `numbers` list, `suma` is `suma + min(a, b)`, `a` is the second element of the original `numbers` list, `numbers` is a non-empty list with its first element removed, `a` is now the first element of `numbers`, `suma` is updated by adding the minimum of `a` and `b` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates `suma` by adding the minimum of `a` and `b` to its current value. The values of `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `numbers`, `b`, `a`, and the structure of the list `numbers` remain unchanged.
