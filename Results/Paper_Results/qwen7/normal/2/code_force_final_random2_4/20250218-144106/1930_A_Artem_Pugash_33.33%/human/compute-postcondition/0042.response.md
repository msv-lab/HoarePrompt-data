Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `numCases`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `numCases`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `numCases` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is the final iteration count.
   - `numInteger` is an input integer.
   - `numbers` is an empty list.
   - `suma` is the sum of `min(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is the final iteration count, it means the loop has completed all its iterations.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented by 1 and should now be equal to `numCases`.
   - `numCases` remains the same as it is an external condition that controls the loop.
   - `numInteger` and `numbers` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `suma` also remains unchanged as it is calculated within the loop and does not affect the loop condition.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be set to `numCases`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which actually won't happen because the loop has already completed) would be:

State: **`numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of `min(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop.**
