You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = input().split()
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}. It then sorts these integers in ascending order, iterates through them in pairs, calculates the sum of the minimum values from each pair, and prints the total sum. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the sum for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers (`numInteger`) which is `2n`.
   - It then reads the list of integers as a string and splits it into individual elements.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The program sorts the list of integers in ascending order using `numbers.sort(reverse=False)`.

3. **Calculating the Score:**
   - The program initializes a variable `suma` to store the cumulative score.
   - It enters a loop that continues until the list `numbers` is empty.
   - In each iteration, it pops the first two elements from the sorted list (`a` and `b`), calculates the minimum of these two values, and adds it to `suma`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all pairs, it prints the total score `suma`.

### Reasoning

1. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting the list in ascending order ensures that when we pick the smallest two numbers in each pair, we are always picking the smallest available numbers. This is crucial because the goal is to maximize the score, and picking the smallest numbers first ensures that we are maximizing the sum of the minimums.

2. **Popping Elements:**
   - Popping the first two elements from the sorted list in each iteration guarantees that we are always pairing the smallest available numbers. This is optimal because it ensures that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs until the list is empty, ensuring that all pairs are processed.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The score is calculated correctly by summing up the minimum of each pair.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
