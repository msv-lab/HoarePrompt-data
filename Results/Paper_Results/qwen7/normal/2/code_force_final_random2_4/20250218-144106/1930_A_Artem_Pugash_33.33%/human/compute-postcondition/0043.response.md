Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of `min(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop, `numInteger` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `numInteger = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `numInteger`. The other variables remain unchanged.
