Output State: **`numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of input integers with the first element removed, `suma` is 0, `a` is the first element of the original `numbers` list, `b` is the first element of the original `numbers` list.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the `numbers` list and assigns it to `b`. Since `numbers` was a non-empty sorted list, after popping the first element, it remains a non-empty sorted list but with the first element removed. The value of `a` is the first element of the original `numbers` list before any modifications, and `b` is set to this same value. The other variables (`numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `suma`) remain unchanged.
