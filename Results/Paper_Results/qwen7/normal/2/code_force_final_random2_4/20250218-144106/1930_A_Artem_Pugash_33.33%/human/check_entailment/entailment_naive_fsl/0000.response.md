Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the score. Specifically, the program always pops the first two elements from the sorted list and adds the smaller one to the score. However, this approach does not necessarily yield the maximum score. For example, consider the input:

```
3
2
2 4
```

The program would sort the list `[2, 4]` and then add `2` to the score, resulting in a score of `2`. However, the optimal strategy here would be to pair `2` and `4`, adding `2` to the score, and then the next pair could be any remaining numbers, which would not change the score since there would be only one number left. Therefore, the maximum score should be `2`.

To achieve the correct solution, the program needs to ensure that the smallest available numbers are paired together in each step, which can be done using a min-heap or by sorting and pairing the smallest elements iteratively. The current implementation does not guarantee this optimal pairing strategy.
