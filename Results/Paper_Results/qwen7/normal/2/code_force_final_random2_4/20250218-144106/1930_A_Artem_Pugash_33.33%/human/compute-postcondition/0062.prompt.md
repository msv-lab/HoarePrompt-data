Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numCases` is an input integer, and the values of `t` and `n` are not yet determined
Code of the loop:
for i in range(numCases):
    numInteger = int(input())
    numbers = input().split()
    numbers.sort(reverse=False)
    suma = 0
    while numbers != []:
        a = int(numbers.pop(0))
        b = int(numbers.pop(0))
        suma += min(a, b)
    print(suma)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers taken from the original list `numbers`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `numbers` will be an empty list because the loop continues to pop elements from `numbers` until it is empty. For each iteration, the smallest of two consecutive numbers is added to `suma`. Therefore, `suma` will contain the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs of consecutive numbers from the original list `numbers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is the final iteration count, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of `min(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `numbers` will be an empty list since each element was popped off during each iteration. The variable `suma` will hold the cumulative sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the `numbers` list during each iteration of the loop. The value of `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed, which is determined by the length of the original `numbers` list divided by 2 (since two elements are processed per iteration).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum pairs of elements from the original `numbers` list.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `numbers` will be an empty list because each pair of elements has been processed exactly once. The variable `suma` will contain the sum of the minimum values from each pair of consecutive elements in the original `numbers` list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
