The only variable in the loop head is the list `numbers`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` contains at least one element less than before. For the loop to be executed one more time, `numbers` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `numbers` still contains at least one element.

State: **`numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` must contain at least one element, `a` is the first element of `numbers` before popping, `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping, `suma` is `min(a, b)` + `min(a, b)`**
