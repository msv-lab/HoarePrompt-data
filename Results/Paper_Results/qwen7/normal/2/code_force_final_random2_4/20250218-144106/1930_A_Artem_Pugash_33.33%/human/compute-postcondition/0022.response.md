Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `numCases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `numInteger` is an input integer.
   - `numbers` is an empty list.
   - `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers taken from the original list `numbers`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `numCases` iterations. At the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop pops elements from `numbers` until it is empty.
   - For each pair of consecutive numbers, the minimum value is added to `suma`.

4. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `numCases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `numInteger` is an input integer.
   - `numbers` is an empty list.
   - `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers taken from the original list `numbers`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 at the beginning of each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `numCases`. Therefore, `i` must be 1 and `numCases` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it needs to be adjusted to 1.
   - `numCases` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers taken from the original list `numbers`.**
