Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `ans` is increased by `max(0, x - 1)`, where `x` is the second element of `cnt`.
   - `cnt` must contain at least two elements.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for x in cnt:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `cnt`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `x` is taken from `cnt` in each iteration, `x` will be the first element of `cnt` in the current iteration.
   - After processing the first element of `cnt` in the current iteration, `cnt` will lose its first element, leaving it with one less element than before.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `ans` is updated based on the value of `x` (the second element of `cnt` in the previous iteration), but this does not change how the loop proceeds.
   - `cnt` loses its first element, so it now contains one less element than before.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `cnt` has lost its first element, and `x` will be the new first element of `cnt`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is increased by `max(0, x - 1)`, where `x` is the second element of `cnt`, `cnt` must contain at least one element.**
