Output State: **`cnt` is [1, 0, 0], `ans` is 8, `a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer**

Explanation: The code `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[x]` by 1. Since the value of `x` is not specified, we cannot determine exactly which element of `cnt` is incremented. However, we know that one of the elements in `cnt` (at index `x`) is now incremented by 1. The other variables (`ans` and `a`) remain unchanged.
