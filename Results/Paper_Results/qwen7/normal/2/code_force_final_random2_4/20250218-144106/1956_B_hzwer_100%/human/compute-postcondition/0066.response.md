Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in cnt:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `cnt`. At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is `[1, 2]`, which means there are two elements left in the list.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must still contain at least one element. After the current iteration, `x` will take the value of the first element in `cnt`, which is `1`. Therefore, `cnt` will be updated to remove the first element, resulting in `cnt = [2]`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: The variable `x` will be set to the first element of `cnt` (which is `1`), and `cnt` will be updated to the remaining elements (which is `[2]`).

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`cnt` is [2], `ans` is 2**
