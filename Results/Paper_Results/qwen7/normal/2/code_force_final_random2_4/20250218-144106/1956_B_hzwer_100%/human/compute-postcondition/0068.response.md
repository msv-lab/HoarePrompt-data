Output State: `cnt` is [2], `ans` is 3.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `cnt` will be reduced to `[2]` because each iteration decrements the first element of `cnt` until it reaches 0. The variable `ans` starts at 8 and is incremented by the maximum of 0 and the current value of `x` (which is the first element of `cnt`) minus 1 during each iteration. After 3 iterations, `ans` is incremented by 1, 1, and then 0 (since the first element of `cnt` is now 0), resulting in `ans` being 3.
