Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: `x` takes the next value from the list `a`, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1.
- **For Loop Statement**: 
  ```python
  for x in a:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop variable `x` is taken from the list `a`.
   - The loop also modifies the dictionary `cnt` by incrementing `cnt[x]`.

2. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `x` takes the next value from the list `a`, the next value of `x` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that there are more elements left in the list `a`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `x` will take the next value from the list `a`.
   - `cnt[x]` will be incremented by 1 for the new value of `x`.

### Final State:
- `x` will be the next value from the list `a`.
- `cnt[x]` will be incremented by 1 for the new value of `x`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`x` is the next value from the list `a`, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1**.
