Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in cnt:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the `cnt` list.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `cnt` is [1, 2, 0]
   - `ans` is 1

4. **Determine the Next Value of `x`**: In the current state, `x` will take the next value from the `cnt` list. Since `cnt` is [1, 2, 0], the next value of `x` will be 0 (the last element in the list).

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `cnt` will now be [1, 2] because the last element (0) has been processed.
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since no modifications are specified, `ans` stays as 1.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `cnt` is [1, 2]
   - `ans` is 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`cnt` is [1, 2], `ans` is 1**
