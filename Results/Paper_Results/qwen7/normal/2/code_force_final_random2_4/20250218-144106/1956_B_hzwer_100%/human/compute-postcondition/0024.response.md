Output State: `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`, `cnt` is a list where each element (except for the element at index 0) is equal to the number of times the corresponding integer appeared in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, `ans` will be the total count of how many times each number in the list `a` appeared, minus one, summed up for all numbers in `cnt`. The list `cnt` will have been updated such that each element (except the first one) represents the count of its respective integer in `a`, with each count decremented by one after each iteration of the loop.
