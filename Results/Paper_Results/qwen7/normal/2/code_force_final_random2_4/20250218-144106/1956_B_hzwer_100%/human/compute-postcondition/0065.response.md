Output State: **`cnt` is [1, 2], `ans` is 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `max(0, x - 1)` to it. Given that `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, since the initial value of `ans` is 1, and `max(0, x - 1)` will be added to it, we need to consider the possible values of `x`. 

If `x` is 1 or greater, `max(0, x - 1)` will be `x - 1`, which means `ans` will become `1 + (x - 1) = x`. Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we assume the simplest case where `x` could be 1, making `ans` equal to 2. The list `cnt` remains unchanged.
