Output State: **i is 3, n must be greater than 0, r is an input value, and if r equals '>', then prev is 3; otherwise, prev remains unchanged.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 3, assuming `n` is greater than 0. The variable `r` will be the input received from the last iteration of the loop. If the input `r` is '>', then `prev` will be set to 3. If `r` is not '>', `prev` will retain its previous value.
