Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `r` is an input string
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 0
- `v2` is 1
- `prev` is 0 (remains unchanged)

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Here, `v1` is explicitly stated to be 0, and `v2` is explicitly stated to be 1. Therefore, the print statement will substitute these values into the formatted string.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
