Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 4, but its specific value is not needed for this print statement.
   - `r` is an input string, but its value is not specified.
   - `prev` remains unchanged unless `r` equals '>', in which case `prev` becomes 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 3.
- `prev` is unchanged unless `r` equals '>', so `prev` could be any value except 1 if `r` does not equal '>', or it could be 1 if `r` equals '>', but the exact value of `prev` is not specified in the print statement itself.

Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state, it must be a placeholder or a variable that is not part of the given information. Given the context, it seems like `v1` might be a typo or a placeholder for `i`, but since it is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its value.

Given the lack of a clear definition for `v1`, we can only assume it might be a typo for `i` or another undefined variable. Since the exact value of `v1` is not provided, we will treat it as a placeholder.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for `v1` and `prev`.

Output: **'? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev]'**
