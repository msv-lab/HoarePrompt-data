Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement)
- `v2` is 1

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

From the initial state, we know the value of `v2` is 1, but there is no explicit value given for `v1`. Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state, it cannot be determined precisely. Therefore, `v1` will remain as `v1` in the output.

Given the above, the output will be:
Output: **? v1 v1 1 1**
