Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, n):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `v2` is 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - The current value of `r` is equal to '<' (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
