Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be at least 3, but its exact value is not specified. We only know it is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `r` is an input string from the user. Its value is unknown.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is `n - 1`. Since `n` is at least 3, `v1` will be at least 2.
   - `v2` is `n - 1`, so `v2` will also be at least 2.
   - `prev` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `r` equals `>` or not.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

Given the above breakdown, let's determine the values that will be printed:

- `v1` is `n - 1`, and since `n` is at least 3, `v1` will be at least 2.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `v1` is again `n - 1`, so it will be the same as the first occurrence of `v1`.
- `prev` depends on the value of `r`. If `r` is `>`, then `prev` is 1; otherwise, `prev` is 2.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only say that `v1` will be at least 2. Therefore, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for these values.

Output: **'? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev]' where v1 is at least 2 and prev is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of r**
