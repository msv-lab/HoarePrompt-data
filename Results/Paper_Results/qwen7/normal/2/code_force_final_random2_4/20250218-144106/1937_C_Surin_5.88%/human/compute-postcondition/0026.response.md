Output State: **`i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` must be unchanged, `v1` must be unchanged**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. Since no variables are assigned or modified within this line of code, their values remain unchanged.
