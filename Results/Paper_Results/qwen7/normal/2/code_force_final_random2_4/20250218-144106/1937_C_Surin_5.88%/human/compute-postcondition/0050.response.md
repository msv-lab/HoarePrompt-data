Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `n` is stated to be greater than 0, but its specific value is not needed for the print statement.
   - `r` is an input string, but its specific value is not provided.
   - `prev` is defined based on the value of `r`:
     - If `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is 2.
     - Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`.
   - From the initial state, we know `i` is 3.
   - `v1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it must be a placeholder or a typo. Given the context, it seems like `v1` might be intended to refer to `i`, but since `v1` is not defined, we should consider it as a placeholder for now.
   - `prev` depends on the value of `r`. Since `r` is not specified, we need to consider both possibilities:
     - If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 2.
     - Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.

Given the lack of a specific value for `r`, we need to consider both cases:

- If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 2.
- If `r` is not '>', then `prev` remains unchanged (but its value is not provided).

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `r`, we can only provide the output in terms of these conditions.

Output: **'? 3 3 3 prev' or '? 3 3 3 2' depending on the value of r**
