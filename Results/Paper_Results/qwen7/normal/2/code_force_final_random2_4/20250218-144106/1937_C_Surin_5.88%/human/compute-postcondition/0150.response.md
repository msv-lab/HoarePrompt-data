Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `r` is an input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and `prev` is 0**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the standard output. Since no variables are modified by this operation, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
