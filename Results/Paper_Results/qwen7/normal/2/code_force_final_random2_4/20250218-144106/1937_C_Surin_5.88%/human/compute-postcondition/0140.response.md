Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3
- `n` is an input integer
- `r` is an input string
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 2
- `v2` is 3
- `prev` is still 0

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

This statement will print a formatted string with the values of the variables `v1` and `v2`. Specifically, it will print `? 2 2 3 3`.

Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
