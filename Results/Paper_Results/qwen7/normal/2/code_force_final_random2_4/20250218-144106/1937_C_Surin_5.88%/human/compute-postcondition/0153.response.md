Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `r` is the input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and `prev` is `i`.**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `r == '>'` also remains true since no changes were made to `r`.
