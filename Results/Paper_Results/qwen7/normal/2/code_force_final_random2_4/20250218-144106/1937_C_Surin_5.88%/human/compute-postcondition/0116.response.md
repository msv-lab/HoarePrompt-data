Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `r` is an input string, and `prev` remains unchanged (still 0)**.

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all pending buffered data is written to the terminal. However, this operation does not affect any variable values or states. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states.
