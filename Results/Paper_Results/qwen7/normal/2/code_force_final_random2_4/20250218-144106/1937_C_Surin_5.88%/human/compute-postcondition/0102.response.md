Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `r` is an input string, and if `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is set to 1.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the standard output. Since no variables are modified, the initial states of the variables remain unchanged.
