Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `r` is an input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and `prev` is 0, `r` is assigned the value of input string.**

The code `r = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
