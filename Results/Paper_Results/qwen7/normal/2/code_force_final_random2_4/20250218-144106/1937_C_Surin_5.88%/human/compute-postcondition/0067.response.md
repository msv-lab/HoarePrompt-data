Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `v2` is 3, `r` is an input string from the user.**

The code `r = input('')` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `r`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `v2` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains valid.
