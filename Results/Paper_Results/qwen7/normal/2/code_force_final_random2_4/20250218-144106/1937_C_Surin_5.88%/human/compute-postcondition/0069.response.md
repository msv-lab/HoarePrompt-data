Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `v1` is 3, `r` is an input string from the user and its current value is equal to '<'**.

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 3) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 3, `n` must still be greater than 1, `v1` is now 3, and `r` remains an input string with its current value being '<'.
