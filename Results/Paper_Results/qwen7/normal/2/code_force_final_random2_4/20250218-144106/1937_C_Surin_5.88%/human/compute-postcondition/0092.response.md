Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is an integer greater than 4 but no specific value is provided for it.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `i` is explicitly given as 1. However, `v1` and `prev` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their values. Since these variables are not defined, we can only use the information provided about `i`.

Given the format of the print statement and the value of `i`, the output will include `i` which is 1, and placeholders for `v1` and `prev` since their values are unknown.

Output: **'? [v1] 1 [v1] [prev]'**
