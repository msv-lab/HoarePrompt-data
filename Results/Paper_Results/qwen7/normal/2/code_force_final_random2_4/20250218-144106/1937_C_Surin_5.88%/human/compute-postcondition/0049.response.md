Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `r` is an input string
   - If the current value of `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is 2; otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration where `i` was 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - The variable `r` and `prev` remain unchanged as they are not mentioned to be modified in the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `r` remains an input string.
   - `prev` remains unchanged based on its previous value (either 2 or unchanged).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is an input string, and if the current value of `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is 2; otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged**.
