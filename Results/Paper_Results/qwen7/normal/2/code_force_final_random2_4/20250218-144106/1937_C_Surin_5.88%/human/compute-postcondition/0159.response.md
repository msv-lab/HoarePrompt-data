Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `r` is the input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and `prev` is 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that any pending output is written to the terminal. Since no variables are updated or affected by this operation, the initial state remains unchanged.
