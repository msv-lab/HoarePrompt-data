Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n` in the statement `for i in range(1, n):`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `v2` is 4.
   - `v1` remains unchanged as 4.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 4, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from 4 to 5.
   - `n` must remain greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` will be 5.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.
   - `v2` remains 4.
   - `v1` remains 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4, `v2` is 4, and `v1` remains unchanged as 4.**
