Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `r` is an input string
   - If the current value of `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is 1. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 2) must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - The values of `r` and `prev` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is an input string, and if the current value of `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is 1. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.**
