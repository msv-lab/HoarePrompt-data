Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 5
- `n` must be greater than 4 (though the value of `n` itself is not needed for this specific print statement)
- `v2` is 5

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Here, `v1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information. Therefore, we cannot provide a precise value for `v1`. 

The statement will print the placeholder `?` followed by the values of `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`. Since `v2` is explicitly defined as 5, it will be printed as 5 twice.

Output: **? ? 5 5**
