Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
   - `u` and `v` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - If `v` is equal to the first element of the list `tree`, then `u` is appended to the left end of `tree`.
   - If `v` is not equal to the first element of the list `tree`, then `v` is appended to the left end of `tree` if `v` is not already the last element of `tree`. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(n - 1)`.
   - This means the loop will run as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is currently 1, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we need to adjust `i` to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.
   - `u` and `v` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` and `v` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers**.
