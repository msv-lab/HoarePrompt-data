Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n-2`.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `empty` is True
- `t` is 1
- `u` is an input integer between 1 and `n`
- `v` is an input integer between 1 and `n`
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5
- `tree` is an empty deque

We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means we need to set `i` to 0 and ensure that `n - 1` is a positive number.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` should be set to 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (since 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5).

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
