Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` and `v` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers. If `v` is equal to the last element of the list `tree`, then `tree` remains unchanged. If `v` is not equal to the last element of the list `tree`, then either `u` is equal to the first element of the list `tree`, in which case `v` is appended to the left end of `tree`, or no change occurs to `u`, `v`, `i`, and `n`.
