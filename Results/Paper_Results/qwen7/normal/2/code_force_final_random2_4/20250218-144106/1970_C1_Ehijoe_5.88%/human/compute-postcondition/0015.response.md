Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` is an input integer; `v` is an input integer; `v` is not equal to `tree[0]`; the last element of `tree` is now `u`**.

Explanation: The code `tree.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `tree`. Since `v` is equal to the last element of `tree` before appending `u`, after appending `u`, the last element of `tree` becomes `u`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
