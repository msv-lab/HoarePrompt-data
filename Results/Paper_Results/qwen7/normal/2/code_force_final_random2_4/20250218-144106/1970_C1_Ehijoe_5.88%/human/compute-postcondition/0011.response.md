Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, the current value of `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, `tree` now has the first element as `u` and the second element as the original first element of `tree`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(u)` appends the value of `u` to the left end of the deque `tree`. Since `v` was initially equal to the first element of `tree`, after appending `u` to the left, `v` remains unchanged, but `tree` now has `u` as its first element and the original first element of `tree` as its second element.
