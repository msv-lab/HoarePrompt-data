Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` is appended to the list `tree`, `v` is appended to the list `tree`, `empty` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `empty` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `u`, or `v`. The lists `tree` still contain `u` and `v` as elements. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 remains unchanged.
