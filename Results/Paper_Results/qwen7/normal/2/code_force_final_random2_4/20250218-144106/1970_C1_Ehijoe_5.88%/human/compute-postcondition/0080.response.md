Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is an input integer.
- `i` is `start - 1`.
- The deque `tree` is empty.
- `idx` is an error because `tree` is empty.
- `moves` is `[min(start - 1, idx), min(start - 1, n - idx - 1)]`. Given that `tree` is empty, `idx` is not defined, and thus the expression `min(start - 1, idx)` results in an error. However, since there exists at least one move in `moves` that is odd, this implies that `n` must be such that at least one of the elements in `moves` is odd. But this does not affect the execution of the print statement.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Ron')
```

This will directly print the string "Ron".

Output: **Ron**
