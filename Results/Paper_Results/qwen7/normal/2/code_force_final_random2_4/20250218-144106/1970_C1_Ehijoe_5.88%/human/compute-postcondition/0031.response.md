Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` now has the first element as `u` and the second element as the original first element of `tree`. If `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, then either the last element of `tree` is updated to `u` (if the last element of `tree` was `u`), or `tree` now has one additional element which is `v` (if `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`), or `tree` now has two elements where the first is `v` and the second is `u`.
