Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still 0, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2. The values of `u` and `v` are the integers input by the user.
