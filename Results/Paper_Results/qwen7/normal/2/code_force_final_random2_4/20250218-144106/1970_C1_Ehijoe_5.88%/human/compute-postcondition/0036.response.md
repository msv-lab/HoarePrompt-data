Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` and `v` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `u` and `v`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
