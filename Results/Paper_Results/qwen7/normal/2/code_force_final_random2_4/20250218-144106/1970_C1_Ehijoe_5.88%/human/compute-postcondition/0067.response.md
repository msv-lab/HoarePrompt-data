Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `v` is appended to the end of `tree`. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `v` is appended to the beginning of `tree`. Otherwise, `v` is appended to the end of `tree`.
