Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `tree` contains the integers `u` and `v`, `empty` is False.**

Explanation: The line `empty = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `empty`. It does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `u`, `v`, or `tree`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `empty` is updated to `False`.
