Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, `v` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5; `tree` is an empty deque.**

The code initializes an empty deque named `tree`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `u`, `v`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
