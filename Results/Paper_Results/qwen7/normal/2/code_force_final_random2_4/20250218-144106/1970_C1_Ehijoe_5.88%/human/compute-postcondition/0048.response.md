Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` and `v` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers. If `v` is equal to the last element of the list `tree`, then no change occurs to `u`, `v`, `i`, and `n`. Otherwise, if `u` is equal to the first element of the list `tree`, then `v` is appended to the left end of `tree`. If neither condition is met, then no change occurs to `u`, `v`, `i`, and `n`.
