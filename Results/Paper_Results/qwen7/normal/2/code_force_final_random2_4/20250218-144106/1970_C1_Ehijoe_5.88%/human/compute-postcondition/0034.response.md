Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and the list `tree` is updated as follows:
- If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` now has the first element as `u` and the second element as the original first element of `tree`.
- Otherwise, if the last element of `tree` is `u`, then the last element of `tree` remains `u`.
- Otherwise, if `u` is equal to `tree[0]`, then `tree` is now `[v, u]`.
- Otherwise, `tree` now has one additional element which is `v`.
