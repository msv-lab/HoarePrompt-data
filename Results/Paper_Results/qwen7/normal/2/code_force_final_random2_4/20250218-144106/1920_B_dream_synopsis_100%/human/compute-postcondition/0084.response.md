Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing an additional element based on the conditions provided, `sums` is the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `sums` as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Here, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `x` is not defined in the given code snippet, so we assume `x` refers to `i`, which is 3. Therefore, `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:3])`. The values of `a`, `i`, `sum1`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
