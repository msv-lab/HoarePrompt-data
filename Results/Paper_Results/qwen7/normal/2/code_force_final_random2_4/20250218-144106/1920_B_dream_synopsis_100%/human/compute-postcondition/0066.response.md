Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, and `sums` is equal to `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` adds the element `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[0]` since `i` is 1) to `sums`. Since `sums` was not initialized before, it starts as 0, and after adding `a[0]`, `sums` becomes `a[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
