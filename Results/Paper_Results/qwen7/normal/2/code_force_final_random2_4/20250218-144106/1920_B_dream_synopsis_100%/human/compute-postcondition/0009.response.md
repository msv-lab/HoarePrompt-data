Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**

Explanation: The variable `sums` is assigned the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Here, `sum1` and `a[:x]` are used as they are, since their values are not specified. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it was set to 0 initially, and `k` also remains unchanged as it is a non-negative integer.
