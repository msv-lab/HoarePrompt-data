Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing either `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums = a[0]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`; `ans` now contains one additional element which is `sums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged, including `sum1`, `a`, and the condition for `sums`.
