Postcondition: `i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `sums` is updated based on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`. If the condition is true, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and `ans` is a list containing the updated `sums`. If the condition is false, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`, and `ans` is a list containing the updated `sums + a[0]`.
