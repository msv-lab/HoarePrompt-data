Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop, and `ans` will contain `k + 2` elements, each being the value of `sums` after each iteration from 0 to `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `i`, `sums`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `k + 1`, `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop, and `ans` will contain `k + 2` elements, each being the value of `sums` after each iteration from 0 to `k + 1`.
