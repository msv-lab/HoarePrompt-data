Output State: **`a` is a list of three integers sorted in ascending order: [n, k, x] where n, k, and x are integers within the range 1 to 10^4.**

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers within the range 1 to 10^4, after sorting, the list `a` will contain these three integers in ascending order.
