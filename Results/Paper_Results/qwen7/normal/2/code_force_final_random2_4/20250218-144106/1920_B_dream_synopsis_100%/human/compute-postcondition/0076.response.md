Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing either `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i` is 0, or `sums = a[0] - 2 * a[x]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums = a[0]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`, and `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` is appended with `sums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `a`, `i`, `sum1`, and the expression for `sums` remain unchanged. The updated state includes that `ans` now contains the previously calculated `sums` value.
