Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop, and `ans` will contain `k + 2` elements, each being the value of `sums` after each iteration from 0 to `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a` in-place. This means that the list `a` is now in reverse order compared to its original sorted state. The values of `i`, `sums`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
