Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`, `sums` is `a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and the current value of `i` plus `x` minus 1 is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty list, after this line of code, `ans` now contains one element, which is `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
