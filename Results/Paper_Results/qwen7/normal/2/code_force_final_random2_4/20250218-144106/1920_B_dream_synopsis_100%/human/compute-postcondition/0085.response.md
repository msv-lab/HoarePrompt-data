Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing an additional element `sums`, `sums` is the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation: The code appends `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, where `x` is the value of `i`, which is 3. Therefore, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:3])`. The other variables remain unchanged.
