Output State: **`a` is a list of three integers [n, k, x], n, k, and x are integers within the range 1 to 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `a`. Given the initial state where `n`, `k`, and `x` are the first, second, and third integer inputs respectively, these values are now stored in the list `a` as `[n, k, x]`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged but are now part of the list `a`.
