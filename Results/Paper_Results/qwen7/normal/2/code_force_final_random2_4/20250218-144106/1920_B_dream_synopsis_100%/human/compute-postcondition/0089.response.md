Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing `sums + a[2]`, and `sums` is equal to `sum1 + a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is equal to `sum1 + a[2]`, the updated `ans` list now contains the value of `sum1 + a[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
