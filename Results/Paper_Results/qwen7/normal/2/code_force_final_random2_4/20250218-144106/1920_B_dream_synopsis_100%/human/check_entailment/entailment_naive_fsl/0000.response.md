Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the game described. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Here's a counterexample to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the following input:
```
3
4 1 1
-3 -1 1 2
6 6 3
-1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6
2 2 1
-4 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
-12
-1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
0
-1
```

**Explanation:**

1. For the first test case (`4 1 1`), the array is `[-3, -1, 1, 2]`. Alice can remove one element, and Bob can negate one element. The optimal strategy would be for Alice to remove `-3`, and Bob to negate `1` to `-1`. The resulting array is `[-1, 2]`, and the sum is `-1`.

2. For the second test case (`6 6 3`), the array is `[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6]`. Alice can remove up to 6 elements, and Bob can negate up to 3 elements. The optimal strategy would be for Alice to remove the smallest elements, and Bob to negate the remaining smallest elements. The resulting array is `[-6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1]`, and the sum is `-21`. However, the program outputs `-12`, which is incorrect.

3. For the third test case (`2 2 1`), the array is `[-4, 3]`. Alice can remove one element, and Bob can negate one element. The optimal strategy would be for Alice to remove `-4`, and Bob to negate `3` to `-3`. The resulting array is `[-3]`, and the sum is `-3`. However, the program outputs `-1`, which is incorrect.

The program fails to consider the optimal strategies for both players and instead uses a suboptimal approach. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
