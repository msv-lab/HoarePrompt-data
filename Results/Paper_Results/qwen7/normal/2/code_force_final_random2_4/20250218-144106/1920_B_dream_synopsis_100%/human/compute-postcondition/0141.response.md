Output State: The loop will execute exactly `k + 1` times. After all iterations, `i` will be `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` will be calculated based on the value of `sums` at each iteration. 

- If `i + x - 1 < n` is true for any iteration, `sums` will include the corresponding term from the list `a`.
- If `i + x - 1 >= n` is true for any iteration, `sums` will not include the corresponding term from the list `a`.

The final `ans` will be a list of `k + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative sum according to the conditions specified in the loop body.
