Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 3, `i` is 4, `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[4]`, `a[4]` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, `a[4]` is equal to `prod // a[4]`. Therefore, `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[4]`. The values of `bets`, `i`, and `a[4]` remain unchanged.
