Output State: **`sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` is greater than 0, `prod` is equal to the product of all elements in the list `a` up to index `bets - 1`, and `ans` is an empty string.**

The variable `ans` is assigned an empty string `''`. All other variables (`sumo`, `i`, `bets`, `prod`) retain their previous values.
