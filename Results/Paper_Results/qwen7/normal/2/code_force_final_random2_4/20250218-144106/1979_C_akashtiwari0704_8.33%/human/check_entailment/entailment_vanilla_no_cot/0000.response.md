Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Bets**: The program calculates `a[i]` as `prod // a[i]`, which is not necessarily the correct way to ensure that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome. This approach might lead to an incorrect distribution of bets.

2. **Product Calculation**: The product `prod` of all multipliers is calculated, but it is not used correctly to ensure the condition is met. Instead, the program should find a way to distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The program checks if `sumo >= prod` and prints `-1` if true, but this does not guarantee that the solution is correct. It only checks if the sum of the bets is less than the product of all multipliers, which is not sufficient.

4. **No Guarantee of Solution Existence**: The program does not guarantee that a valid distribution of bets exists. For some cases, it might incorrectly return `-1` even though a valid distribution might exist.

A correct approach would involve finding a way to distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. One possible method is to use binary search or a greedy algorithm to find the minimum bet for each outcome that satisfies the condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Find the maximum k_i
        max_k = max(a)
        
        # Calculate the total bet
        total_bet = sum([x - 1 for x in a])
        
        # Check if the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome
        if total_bet < max_k:
            ans = ' '.join(str(x-1) for x in a)
            print(ans)
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

This version ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for the outcome with the highest multiplier (`max_k`).
