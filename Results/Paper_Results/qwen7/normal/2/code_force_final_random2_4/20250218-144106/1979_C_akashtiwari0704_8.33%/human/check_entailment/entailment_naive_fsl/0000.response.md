Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program calculates the product of all multipliers (`k_i` values) and then divides this product by each individual `k_i` value to determine the bets. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total bet amount will be strictly less than the total winnings for any winning outcome.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
5 5 5
```

The program will calculate the product as `5 * 5 * 5 = 125`. Then, it will divide this product by each `k_i` value to get the bets:

- For the first outcome: `125 // 5 = 25`
- For the second outcome: `125 // 5 = 25`
- For the third outcome: `125 // 5 = 25`

The total bet amount is `25 + 25 + 25 = 75`. However, if the first outcome wins, the player receives `5 * 25 = 125` coins, which is not strictly greater than `75`.

Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirement that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
