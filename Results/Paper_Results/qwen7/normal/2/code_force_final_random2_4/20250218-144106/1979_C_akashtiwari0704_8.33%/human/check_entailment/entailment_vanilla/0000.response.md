Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.

2. **Calculating Total Multiplier Product:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod = 1` and `prod *= a[i]`).
   - This is a crucial part because it helps in determining the total amount of coins that would be returned if any outcome wins.

3. **Distributing Coins:**
   - For each outcome, the program calculates the bet amount as `prod // a[i]`.
   - This ensures that the bet amount for each outcome is a fraction of the total product, which is a key aspect of the problem.

4. **Summing Up Bets:**
   - The program sums up all the calculated bet amounts (`sumo += int(a[i])`).

5. **Checking Condition:**
   - The program checks if the total bet amount (`sumo`) is less than the total product (`prod`).
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints the bet amounts.
   - If the condition is not satisfied, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Condition Check:**
  - The condition `if sumo >= prod:` is correct. It ensures that the total bet amount is strictly less than the total product, which is necessary to "come out ahead" for any winning outcome.
  
- **Bet Calculation:**
  - The calculation `a[i] = prod // a[i]` is correct. It ensures that the bet amount for each outcome is a fraction of the total product, which guarantees that the total bet amount will be less than the total product if the condition holds.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where the sum of bet amounts is not less than the total product by printing `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can conclude that it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
