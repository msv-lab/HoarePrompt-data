Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `bets` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i-1]) + int(a[i])`.
   - `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i < bets`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `bets` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 4.
   - The values of `sumo` and `a[i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which will be 4), but these values are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted here.

5. **Final State**:
   - `bets` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `sumo` and `a[i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`, but these updates are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`bets` must be greater than 3, `i` is 4**.
