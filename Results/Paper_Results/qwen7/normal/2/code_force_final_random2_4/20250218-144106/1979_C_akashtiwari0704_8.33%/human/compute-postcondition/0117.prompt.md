Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = 1
    for i in range(bets):
        prod *= a[i]
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` is greater than 0, `prod` is equal to the product of all elements in the list `a` up to index `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then `sumo` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is set to `bets`, `ans` is a string containing the concatenation of `str(a[i])` followed by a space for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, and `bets` is incremented by the total number of iterations in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sumo` is the sum of all updated values of `a[i]` for each iteration where `i` is less than `bets`, `bets` is greater than 0, and `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets-1`. If `sumo >= prod`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[i]` followed by spaces for each `i` where `i` is less than `bets`, and `sumo` is the sum of all updated values of `a[i]` for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then `bets` is at least the total number of iterations in the loop, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by each element in `a` for all iterations, and each element in `a` is updated to the result of `prod // a[i]` for its respective index. Otherwise, `bets` is greater than 0, and `ans` is a string containing the elements of the list `a`, separated by spaces.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
