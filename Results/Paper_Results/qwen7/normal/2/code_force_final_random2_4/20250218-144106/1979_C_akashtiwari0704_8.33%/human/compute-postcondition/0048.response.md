Output State: **`i` is `bets`, `prod` is equal to `prod * a[bets-1] * a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `prod *= a[i]` multiplies the current value of `prod` by the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is initially equal to `bets`, `prod` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `a[bets-1]` and then further multiplied by `a[i]`, which is `a[bets]`. Therefore, `prod` is now equal to `prod * a[bets-1] * a[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `bets`.
