Output State: **`prod` is 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive and greater than 0, `bets` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The line `prod = 1` initializes the variable `prod` to 1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `bets`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while updating `prod` to 1.
