Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, and `t` must be greater than 0; `bets` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `bets` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, `t` is still an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, and must be greater than 0, while `bets` is now set to the integer input provided by the user.
