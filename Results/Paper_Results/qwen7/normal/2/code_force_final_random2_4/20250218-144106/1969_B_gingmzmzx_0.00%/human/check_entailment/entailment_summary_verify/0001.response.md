### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires transforming a binary string into a sorted (non-decreasing) order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring that is shifted.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It then counts the number of zeroes in the string.
   - Two counters `cnt` are initialized to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - The variable `ans` is used to accumulate the total cost.
   - A loop iterates through each character in the string `s`. For each character:
     - If the character is 0, it checks if there has been at least one 1 encountered (`cnt[1] > 0`). If so, it increments `ans`.
     - If the character is 1, it adds the number of remaining 0s (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the given program attempts to calculate the minimum cost to sort the string. However, the approach taken does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts required to achieve the sorted order.
   - The current logic does not account for the actual positions of 0s and 1s and how shifting them would affect the overall cost.
   - The logic incorrectly assumes that counting the number of 0s before a 1 and vice versa will give the correct minimum cost, which is not true for all cases.

To properly solve this problem, we need to identify the longest contiguous segment of 1s and then determine the cost of shifting the rest of the string to bring all 0s after these segments. This involves finding the minimum number of operations needed to move all 0s to the end of the string.

### Correct Solution Approach:
1. Identify the longest contiguous segment of 1s.
2. Calculate the cost of moving all 0s to the end of the string after these segments.

Here is a revised version of the program that correctly implements this logic:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = input().strip()
        # Find the longest contiguous segment of 1s
        max_ones = 0
        current_ones = 0
        for char in s:
            if char == '1':
                current_ones += 1
                max_ones = max(max_ones, current_ones)
            else:
                current_ones = 0
        
        # Calculate the cost
        cost = len(s) - max_ones
        print(cost)

# Example usage
func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The program iterates through the string to find the longest contiguous segment of 1s.
- The variable `max_ones` keeps track of the maximum length of such segments.
- After identifying the longest segment of 1s, the cost is calculated as the length of the string minus the length of this segment.
- This cost represents the minimum number of operations needed to move all 0s to the end of the string.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The corrected program provided above accurately simulates the required operations and calculates the correct minimum cost.

**Final: False**
