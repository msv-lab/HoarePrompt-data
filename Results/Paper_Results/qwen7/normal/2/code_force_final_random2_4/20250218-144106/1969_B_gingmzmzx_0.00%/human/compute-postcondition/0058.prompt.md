Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `zeroes` remains the count of 0s in the list `s`, `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` remains greater than 1, `cnt` is updated to `[0, 0]`, and `c` remains the last character in the list `s` after the current iteration.
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list, `c` is the first character in the list `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 0, then `ans` is 1 and `cnt[1]` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`, where `zeroes` is the count of 0's in the list `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list (with the first element removed), `c` is the second character in the list `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated as follows: if `c` is '0', `ans` is updated to 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `c` is not '0', `ans` is updated by adding the value of `zeroes - cnt[0]` to its current value, `cnt[c]` is the new count of `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list (with the second element removed), `c` is the third character in the list `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated based on whether `c` is 0 or not. If `c` is 0, `ans` is updated by adding `zeroes - cnt[0]`; otherwise, `ans` is updated by 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0. `cnt[c]` is the count of character `c` in list `s` plus one.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
