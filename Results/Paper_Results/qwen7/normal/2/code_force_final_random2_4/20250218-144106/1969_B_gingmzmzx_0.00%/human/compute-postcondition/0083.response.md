Output State: **`cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to ans + 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains the same, `zeroes` remains unchanged**.

This means that `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The variable `zeroes` is not affected by this code snippet.
