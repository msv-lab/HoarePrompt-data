To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the formula for calculating `ans`.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `zeroes` is the total number of zeros in the list `s`.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the total count of zeros and `cnt[1]` is the total count of ones in the list `s`.
   - `c` is the last character in the list `s`.

2. **Formula for `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the sum of all instances where `c` equals 0 and the count of 1 in `cnt` is greater than 0.
   - For each non-zero character `c` in the list `s`, `ans` includes the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`.

Given this, let's analyze the components:

- `cnt[0]` is the total count of zeros in `s`.
- `cnt[1]` is the total count of ones in `s`.
- If `c` is 0 and `cnt[1] > 0`, then the contribution to `ans` from this instance is 1.
- For any non-zero character `c`, the contribution to `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.

Since `c` is the last character in `s`, it will either be 0 or a non-zero digit. Let's consider both cases:

- If `c` is 0 and `cnt[1] > 0`, then the contribution to `ans` is 1.
- If `c` is a non-zero digit, the contribution to `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.

Therefore, the value of `ans` will be:

\[ ans = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } c = 0 \text{ and } cnt[1] > 0 \\
zeroes - cnt[0] & \text{if } c \neq 0 
\end{cases} \]

Since `c` is the last character in `s`, we need to know its value and the value of `cnt[1]`.

However, without the exact values of `s`, `zeroes`, and `cnt[1]`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. But we can describe it based on the conditions.

Output: **1 if the last character in s is 0 and the count of 1 in cnt is greater than 0, otherwise zeroes - cnt[0]**
