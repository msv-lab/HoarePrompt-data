Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt` is `[0, 0]`, `n` is `n - 1`, `s` is a list of integers (converted from input), `cnt[c]` for each character `c` in `s` contains the total count of that character in `s`, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, `ans` is 0
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers with at least one element; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1 for each element `c` in `s`; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. Additionally, `ans` is increased by the difference between the number of zeroes in `s` (denoted as `zeroes`) and the count of zeroes (`cnt[0]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, then `ans` is updated to `ans + 1`. Otherwise, if `c` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is updated by adding `zeroes - cnt[0]` to its current value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated as follows:
- If `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, then `ans` is updated to `ans + 1`.
- If `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is not greater than 0, then `ans` remains the same.
- If `c` is not 0, then `ans` is updated to `ans + zeroes - cnt[0]`.
- `zeroes` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
