Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `ans` will be the sum of all instances where `c` equals 0 and the count of 1 in `cnt` is greater than 0, plus the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` for each non-zero character `c` in the list `s`. `zeroes` will be the total number of zeros in the list `s`, `t` will be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` will be a list where `cnt[0]` is the total count of zeros and `cnt[1]` is the total count of ones in the list `s`, and `c` will be the last character in the list `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All characters in the list `s` have been processed, `cnt[c]` for each character `c` in `s` contains the total count of that character in `s`, `ans` is the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each non-zero character in `s` and 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 for any zero character in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements in `s` have been processed, `cnt[c]` for each character `c` in `s` contains the total count of that character in `s`, `ans` is the sum of increments based on the conditions specified in the loop, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, and no other variables have changed from their initial or intermediate states.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
