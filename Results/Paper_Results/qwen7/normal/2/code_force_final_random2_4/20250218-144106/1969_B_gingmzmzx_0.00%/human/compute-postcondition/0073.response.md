Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers with at least one element; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1 for each element `c` in `s`; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; if `c` equals 0, `ans` is further increased by the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`.
