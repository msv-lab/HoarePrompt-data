Output State: **`s` is a non-empty list, `c` is the first character in the list `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 1, and `cnt[1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Given that `cnt[c]` (where `c` is 0) is incremented by 1, `cnt[0]` is now 1. Since `cnt[1]` is not relevant here (it was not incremented), it remains 0. The condition `cnt[1] > 0` is false, so `ans` is incremented by 0, making `ans` equal to 1.
