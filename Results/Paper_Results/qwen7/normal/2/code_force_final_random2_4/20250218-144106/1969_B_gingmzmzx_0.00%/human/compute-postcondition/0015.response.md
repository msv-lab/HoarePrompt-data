Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or `zeroes - cnt[0]`, depending on whether the first character `c` in the list `s` is 0 or not. `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is [1, 0], and `c` is the first character in the list `s`.
