Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list (with the first element removed), `c` is the second character in the list `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated as follows: if `c` is '0', `ans` is updated to 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. If `c` is not '0', `ans` is updated by adding the value of `zeroes - cnt[0]` to its current value, `cnt[c]` is the new count of `c`.
