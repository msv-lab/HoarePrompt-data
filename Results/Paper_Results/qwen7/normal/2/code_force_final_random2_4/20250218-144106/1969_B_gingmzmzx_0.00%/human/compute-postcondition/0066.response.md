Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over each element `c` in the list `s`. Therefore, the relevant objects in the loop head are `c` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `s` is a list of integers.
   - `c` will take on each value from the list `s` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop will iterate over each integer in the list `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since `s` is a list of integers and the loop iterates over each element in `s`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `s`. Specifically, `s` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `s` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**.
