Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `op` and `ai` to 0. It does not modify the existing variables `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, and `v`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
