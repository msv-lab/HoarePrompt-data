Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for val in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `val` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `a` is not an empty iterable.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is not an empty iterable.
   - `cnt` is increased by 1 (let's assume `cnt` was `cnt + 1`).
   - `op` is updated to `op ^= val >> i & 1`.
   - If `op` is `False`, no additional changes are made to `a` or `cnt`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `a` is not an empty iterable, the loop can continue.
   - For the next iteration, `val` will be the next element in `a`.
   - `cnt` will be incremented by 1 again.
   - `op` will be updated based on the next element in `a`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `a` must still be a non-empty iterable.
   - `cnt` will be incremented by 1.
   - `op` will be updated based on the next element in `a`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `a` is not an empty iterable.
- `cnt` is increased by 1.
- `op` is updated based on the next element in `a`.

Since the exact value of `op` cannot be determined without knowing the next element in `a`, we leave it in its general form.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is not an empty iterable, `cnt` is increased by 1, and `op` is the result of `op ^= next_val >> i & 1` where `next_val` is the next element in `a`**.
