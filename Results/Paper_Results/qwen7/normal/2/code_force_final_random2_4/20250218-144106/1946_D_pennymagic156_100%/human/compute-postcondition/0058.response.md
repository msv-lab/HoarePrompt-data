Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for val in a:`. The variables involved here are `val` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: 
   - `val` is the current element being iterated over from the iterable `a`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that `cnt` is increased by 2 and `op` is updated based on some operation involving `next_val`, `val`, and `i`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - `a` remains the same as it is an iterable and not modified within the loop.
   - `val` changes with each iteration as it takes the next element from `a`.
   - `cnt` is increased by 2 during each iteration.
   - `op` is updated based on the loop body, but its exact value is not relevant for determining the next state.

4. **Postcondition analysis**:
   - The postcondition states that if `not op` is true, then `cnt` is incremented by 1.
   - This means that `cnt` will be incremented by 1 if the condition `not op` evaluates to `True`.

5. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty iterable.
   - `cnt` is increased by 2.
   - `op` is the result of the operation `op ^= next_val >> i & 1 ^ val >> i & 1`.

6. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `a` is an iterable and not modified, it remains the same.
   - `val` will be the next element in `a`.
   - `cnt` will be increased by 2 (as per the loop body).
   - `op` will be updated based on the next iteration, but its exact value is not needed for the state adjustment.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `a` remains the same.
- `val` becomes the next element in `a`.
- `cnt` is increased by 2.
- `op` is updated based on the next iteration, but its exact value is not needed for the state adjustment.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a non-empty iterable, `val` is the next element in `a`, `cnt` is increased by 2, `op` is updated based on the next iteration**.
