Output State: **`a` is a non-empty iterable, `val` is the next element in `a`, `cnt` is increased by 3, `op` is updated based on the next iteration, `op ^= val >> i & 1` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was increased by 2, so now it is increased by 3 in total. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.
