Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `val` is the next element in the list `a`, and `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1`.**

Explanation: The operation `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op`. Here, `val >> i & 1` shifts `val` right by `i` bits and then performs a bitwise AND with 1. This effectively extracts the `i`-th bit (from the right) of `val`. The `^=` operator then performs a bitwise XOR between the current value of `op` and the extracted bit. Since `val` and `i` are not specified, we keep them as they are, but note that `op` has been updated according to the operation.
