Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 27, `u` is `a[0] >> 27 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]` and it is even and non-zero, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 0, so after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
