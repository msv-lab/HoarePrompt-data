The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` is 2, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `op`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]` updated with the new value of `a[i] >> 27 & 1` and it is even and non-zero, `op` is 1, `cnt` is 3.**
