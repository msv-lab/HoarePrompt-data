Output State: **`op` is updated by performing the bitwise XOR operation between its current value and the result of `val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1.**

This means that the value of `op` has been modified according to the given operation, but since the initial values of `op`, `val`, and `i` are not specified, we cannot provide a more specific numerical value for `op`. The other variables remain in their initial state unless otherwise specified.
