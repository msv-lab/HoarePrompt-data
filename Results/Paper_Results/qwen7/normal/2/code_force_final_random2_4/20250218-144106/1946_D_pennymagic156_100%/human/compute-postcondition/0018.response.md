Output State: **`t` is ['ai ^ val'], `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is 0, `op` is False, `ai` is `ai ^ val`**

Explanation: The code `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Since `t` was initially an empty list, after appending `ai`, `t` becomes `['ai ^ val']`. The values of `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `op`, and `ai` remain unchanged.
