The function processes input from the user for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t indicating the number of cases, followed by t pairs of integers n and x, and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. It returns a list containing t lists, where each inner list consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 â‰¤ a_i < 2^30.
