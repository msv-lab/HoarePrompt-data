Output State: **`op` is the result of XORing the initial value of `op` (which is 0) with the results of `val >> i & 1` for each `val` in `a`, `cnt` is the total number of times `op` becomes 0 during the loop, which is equal to the length of `a`, `val` is the last element of the list `a` and `a` must have at least one element.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all iterations, `op` will be the cumulative result of performing a bitwise XOR operation on the least significant bit (after right-shifting by 27 bits) of each element in the list `a`. The variable `cnt` will represent the count of times `op` became 0 during the loop, which is equivalent to the length of the list `a`. The variable `val` will hold the last element of the list `a` that was processed in the loop, and the list `a` must contain at least one element.
