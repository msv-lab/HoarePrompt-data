Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `val` is the next element in the list `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `t` is a list with three elements including `ai`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Initially, `t` had two elements. After appending `ai`, `t` now has three elements. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
