Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]`**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. Therefore, all the variables remain in their initial states.
