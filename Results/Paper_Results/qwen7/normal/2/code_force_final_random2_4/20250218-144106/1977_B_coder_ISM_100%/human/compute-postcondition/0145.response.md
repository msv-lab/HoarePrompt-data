Postcondition: `i` is between 0 and 28 inclusive, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s` is a string where the character at index `i` is not '1' or the character at index `i+1` is not equal to the character at index `i`. If `flag` is 1, the character at index `i` is '0' and the character at index `i+1` is not equal to the character at index `i`. If `flag` is 0, no changes are made to `i`, `flag`, or `s`.
