Output State: **`i` is 29, `30` is the upper limit for the range function, and the current value of `x` is such that `x & pow(2, 29)` evaluates to a non-zero value; `s` contains the element '1'.**

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since the initial state did not specify the contents of `s`, we assume it was initially empty. After appending `'1'`, `s` now contains `'1'`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
