Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 59, `flag` is either true or false, `length` is 60, and each element in the list `s` is either '0', '1', or '-1'.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = length - 1`. Given that the initial state has `i` as 29, after 59 iterations (`i` increments by 1 each time), `i` will become 59. The condition in the loop `(s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1')` checks if the current element `s[i]` is '-1' and the previous element `s[i - 1]` is '1'. If both conditions are met, `s[i]` is changed to '0' and `s[i - 1]` is changed to '-1'. Since the loop runs until `i` reaches `length - 1`, and given that `length` is at least 30 initially and increases with each iteration, by the end of the loop, `i` will be 59 and `length` will be 60. The value of `flag` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
