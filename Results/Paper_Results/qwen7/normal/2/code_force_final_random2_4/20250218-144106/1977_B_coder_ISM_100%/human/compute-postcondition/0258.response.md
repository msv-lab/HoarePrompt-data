Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` remains unchanged (either true or false), `s[i]` is '-1'.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[i]` from its original value, which was either '0' or not equal to '1', to '-1'. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
