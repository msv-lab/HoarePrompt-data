Output State: **`i` is 29; `length` is greater than 29; `s[28]` is '-1'**

The code `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the character at index `i - 1` in the string `s` to be `'-'1'`. Given that `i` is 29, the index `i - 1` is 28. Therefore, `s[28]` is now `'-'1'`. The values of `i` and `length` remain unchanged, and the condition that `length` is greater than 29 still holds true.
