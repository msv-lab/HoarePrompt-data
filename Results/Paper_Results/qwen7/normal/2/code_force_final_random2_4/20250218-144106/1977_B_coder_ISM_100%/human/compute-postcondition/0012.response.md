Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `x` is an integer
   - The postcondition states that if the bitwise AND of `x` and \(2^i\) is true, then '1' is appended to the list `s`. Otherwise, '0' is in the list `s`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 0 to 29 (inclusive).

3. **Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

4. **Adjusting States**: Since the loop is iterating over `i`, the value of `i` will increase by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`x` and `s`) do not change within the loop head and are not adjusted here.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be 1
- `x` remains an integer
- The postcondition for the next iteration will check if the bitwise AND of `x` and \(2^1\) is true, appending '1' to the list `s` or '0' otherwise.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, if the bitwise AND of `x` and \(2^1\) is true, then '1' is appended to the list `s`. Otherwise, '0' is in the list `s`**.
