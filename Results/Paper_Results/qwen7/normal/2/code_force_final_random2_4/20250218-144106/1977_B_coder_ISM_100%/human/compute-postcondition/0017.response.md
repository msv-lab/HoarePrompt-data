Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(30)`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0'.
   - Specifically, '1' is in the list `s` if the bitwise AND of `x` and \(2^1\) (which is 2) is true, and '0' is in the list `s` otherwise.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 30.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is incremented to 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - The values of `x` and `s` do not change based on the loop head alone, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0'. Specifically, '1' is in the list `s` if the bitwise AND of `x` and \(2^1\) is true, and '0' is in the list `s` otherwise.**
