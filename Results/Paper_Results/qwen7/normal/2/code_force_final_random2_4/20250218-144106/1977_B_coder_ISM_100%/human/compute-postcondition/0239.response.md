Output State: **`i` is between 0 and 28 (inclusive), `flag` is either true or false, `s[i]` is '-1', `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]'**

Explanation: The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[i]` from '1' to '-1'. Since `s[i]` was previously equal to `s[i + 1]`, this equality no longer holds, so `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
