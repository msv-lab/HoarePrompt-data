Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**: The code constructs a binary representation of `x` using 30 bits. This is done correctly by checking if `x` has the `i-th` bit set (`x & pow(2, i)`).

3. **Modifying Binary Representation**:
   - The code ensures no two consecutive non-zero bits by setting the current bit to `-1` if the next bit is also `1` and the previous bit is `0`.
   - If the last bit is `0` and the flag is set, it sets the last bit to `1` and adjusts the length.
   - It also ensures that if the flag is set and the last bit is `0`, it sets the last bit to `1` and adds a new bit `1` at the end.

4. **Output**: The code prints the length of the modified sequence and the sequence itself.

Given the problem constraints and the steps taken by the code, it appears that the code correctly generates a sequence of `1`s, `0`s, and `-1`s that satisfies the conditions specified in the problem statement. The modifications ensure that no two consecutive non-zero bits exist, and the sum of the sequence equals `x`.

Correctness: **True**

The provided code meets all the requirements of the problem statement and correctly generates the required sequences for each test case.
