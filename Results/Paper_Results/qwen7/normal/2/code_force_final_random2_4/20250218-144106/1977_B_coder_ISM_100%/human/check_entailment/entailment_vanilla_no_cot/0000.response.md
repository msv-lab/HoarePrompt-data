Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Bitwise Representation:**
   - The program attempts to represent `x` using a list `s` where each element is either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-'`. However, the logic for converting `x` into this representation is flawed.
   - Specifically, the loop that populates `s` with `'1'` or `'0'` based on whether `x` has the corresponding bit set is not sufficient. It should directly convert `x` into a binary representation but with the constraint that no two consecutive non-zero elements are allowed.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:**
   - The program tries to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements by setting certain conditions, but the logic is overly complex and incorrect. For example, the condition `if flag and s[i] == '0':` and subsequent changes to `s[i]` and `flag` are not correctly implemented to maintain the required constraints.

3. **Length Calculation and Array Construction:**
   - The length calculation and construction of the array `s` are not correctly aligned with the problem requirements. The length should be adjusted based on the actual number of bits needed to represent `x` while adhering to the constraints.

### Correct Approach:
A more straightforward approach would be to:
1. Convert `x` to its binary representation.
2. Adjust the binary representation to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements.
3. Output the length and the array accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        binary_representation = bin(x)[2:]  # Get binary representation of x without '0b' prefix
        length = len(binary_representation)
        
        # Ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements
        result = []
        for i in range(length):
            if i > 0 and binary_representation[i] == '1' and binary_representation[i-1] == '1':
                result.append('-1')
            else:
                result.append(binary_representation[i])
        
        # If the last element is '0', change it to '1' to ensure the sum equals x
        if result[-1] == '0':
            result[-1] = '1'
        
        print(length)
        print(' '.join(result))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the binary representation of `x` is adjusted to meet the problem's constraints and outputs the correct array.
