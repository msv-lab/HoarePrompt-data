You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < 2^{30}.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        
        s = []
        
        length = 30
        
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')

                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = '0'
            else:
                pass
        
        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'

        print(*s)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute exactly `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer. After all iterations, the variable `i` will be `30 * t - 1`, meaning it will count up to one less than 30 times the number of iterations. The variable `flag` will be either `True` or `False` depending on the final state of the loop. The `length` variable will be `30 + (t - 1)`, as it increments by 1 for every iteration after the first. The list `s` will contain a sequence of '0's, '1's, and '-1's, with the exact pattern depending on the values of `x` for each iteration and the operations performed within the loop. Each element in `s` will be either '0', '1', or '-1', and the list will have a length of `30 + (t - 1)`.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations, `i` will be `29t`, `flag` will be a boolean value, `length` will be `29 + t`, and `s` will be a list of length `29 + t` containing '0's, '1's, and '-1's, reflecting the transformations applied during each iteration based on the input values of `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, `x` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 2^30 - 1. It returns a result based on the values of `t` and `x`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
