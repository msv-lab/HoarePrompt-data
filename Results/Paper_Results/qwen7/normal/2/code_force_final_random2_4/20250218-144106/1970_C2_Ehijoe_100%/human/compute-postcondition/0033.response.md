Output State: **The `nodes` dictionary remains unchanged, the `leaves` deque is populated with all keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1 in their associated list, `i` is now `n-2`, `u` and `v` hold the last pair of integers input during the final iteration, `empty` remains `True`, and `t` remains 1; `moves` is the result of the function `func_1(nodes, start)`.**

This means that the `moves` variable has been assigned the result of calling the function `func_1` with `nodes` and `start` as arguments. All other variables retain their previous values.
