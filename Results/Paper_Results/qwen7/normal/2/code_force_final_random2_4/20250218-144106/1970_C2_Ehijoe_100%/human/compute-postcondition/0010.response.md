Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[u]` now contains the value `[v]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Initially, `nodes[v]` contained the value `[u]`. After executing `nodes[u].append(v)`, the list `nodes[u]` will contain both `u` and `v`. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged except that `nodes[u]` now includes `v`.
