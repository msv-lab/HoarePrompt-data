Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n - 2`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state of `n`**: Since `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the state of `i`**: As mentioned, `i` should start at 0 and be less than `n - 1`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `n` and `i` to ensure the loop can execute.

### Final State Adjustment

- `n` must be greater than 1 (since `n - 1` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute).
- `i` must be 0 (the starting value of `i`).

### Final Answer

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0**
