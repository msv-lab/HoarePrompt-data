Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now contains the value `[u], u` and `v` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

This means that the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, `u` and `v` are updated to the integers input by the user, and `nodes[v]` is set to contain the list `[u]`.
