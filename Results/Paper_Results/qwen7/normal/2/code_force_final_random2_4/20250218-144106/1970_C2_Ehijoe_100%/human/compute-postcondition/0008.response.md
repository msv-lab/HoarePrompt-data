Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `u` is an input integer.
   - `v` is an input integer.
   - `nodes[v]` now contains the value `[u]`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop but not modified within the loop itself.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 1 (no change needed).

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `u` and `v` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `nodes[v]` remains `[u]` as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now contains the value `[u]***.
