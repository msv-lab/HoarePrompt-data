Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, and `empty` is True.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `nodes` where all values are lists. This does not change the values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, `start`, or `empty`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
