Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still 2 and `n` is still greater than 1. The input values for `u` and `v` are not specified, so they are described as "an input integer".
