Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than 1; `u` is an input integer; `v` is an input integer; `nodes[u]` now includes `v` as an element.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Since `u` and `v` are both input integers, their values remain unchanged. The other variables (`i` and `n`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` remains 2, `n` is still greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `nodes[u]` now contains `v` as one of its elements.
