Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `balance` is 0; `details` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `details = []` creates an empty list named `details`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `balance`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of `s` being a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `balance` being 0, and `details` being an empty list.
