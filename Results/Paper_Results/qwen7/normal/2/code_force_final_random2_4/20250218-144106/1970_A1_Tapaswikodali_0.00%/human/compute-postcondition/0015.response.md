Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", and ")", `balance` is 0, `details` is a list containing one additional tuple (balance, -i, char) where balance is 0, i is the index of the next character in the string s, and char is the next character in the string s, and `i` is the index of the next character in the string `s`.**

This means that the `details` list now includes an additional tuple with the current `balance` (which is 0), the negative index `-i`, and the current character `char` from the string `s`. The `balance` remains 0, and `i` is updated to point to the next character in the string `s`.
