Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" which is the input string from the user.**

The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `s`. Since the initial state of `s` was a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and the code simply reassigns the input to `s`, the new value of `s` is the string input by the user, which is still a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
