Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", and ")", `balance` is either 1 or -1 (it will be 1 if there is at least one more unmatched opening parenthesis than closing ones, or -1 if there is at least one more unmatched closing parenthesis than opening ones, depending on the structure of the string), `details` is a list containing tuples for each character in the string `s`. Each tuple in `details` has three elements: the current value of `balance`, the negative index `-i` of the current character in the string `s`, and the character itself. The length of `details` is equal to the length of the string `s`. The index `i` will be the index of the last character in the string `s`.

This means that after the loop completes, `balance` will reflect whether there are more opening or closing parentheses in the string, and `details` will contain information about the balance at each step of the iteration through the string.
