Output State: The string `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", and ")", `balance` is either 1 or -1, `details` is a list containing a tuple for each character in the string `s`. Each tuple in the list contains three elements: the current value of `balance`, the negative index `-i` of the current character in the string `s`, and the current character `char`. The `balance` value reflects the net difference between the number of "(" and ")" characters in the string `s`. The `details` list captures the state of `balance` and the position of each character as the loop iterates through the string `s`.

In natural language, the final output state means that after the loop has executed for every character in the string `s`, the `balance` will be either 1 or -1, indicating that the string `s` does not have a balanced number of parentheses. The `details` list will contain a tuple for each character in `s`, showing the `balance` at that point, the negative index of the character, and the character itself.
