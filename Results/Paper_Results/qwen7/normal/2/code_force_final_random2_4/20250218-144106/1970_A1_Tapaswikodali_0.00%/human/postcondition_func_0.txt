The function processes a string `s` consisting only of '(' and ')' characters, ensuring it is a balanced parentheses sequence. It calculates the balance of parentheses at each position in the string and stores this information in a list of tuples. After sorting this list based on the balance values, it constructs a new string from the characters in `s` based on the sorted order and prints this new string. The final output is a string where the original characters are reordered according to their balance values during the iteration through the input string.
