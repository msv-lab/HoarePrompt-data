Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves three variables: `i`, `char`, and the tuple `(i, char)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the string `s`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", and ")".
   - `balance` is either 1 or -1.
   - `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, -i, char)`.
   - `i` is the index of the current character `char` in the string `s`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in the string `s`, the next value of `i` will be the current `i` plus 1.
   - The next `char` will be the character at the new index `i` in the string `s`.
   - The `balance` and `details` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since no modifications are specified, they stay the same.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `char` will be the character at the new index `i` in the string `s`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", and ")", `balance` is either 1 or -1, `details` is a list containing one tuple (balance, -i, char), and `i` is the index of the next character in the string `s`.**

Since `i` is incremented by 1 and `char` becomes the character at the new index `i`, the updated state is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", and ")", `balance` is either 1 or -1, `details` is a list containing one tuple (balance, -(i+1), char_at_i+1), and `i` is the index of the next character in the string `s`.**
