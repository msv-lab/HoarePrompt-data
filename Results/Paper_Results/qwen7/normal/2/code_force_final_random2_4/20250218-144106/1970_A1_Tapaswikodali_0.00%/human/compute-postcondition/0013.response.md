Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", and ")", `balance` is now 0, `details` is a list containing one tuple (0, -(i+1), char_at_i+1), and `i` is the index of the next character in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The `balance` variable was decremented by 1, changing its value from either 1 or -1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged, including the string `s`, the `details` list, and the index `i`.
