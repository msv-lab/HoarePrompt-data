Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `a` is `[1000, a[n-3] - T[n-3], a[i-1] - T[i-1]]`
   - `result` is an empty string
   - `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be non-zero
   - `line` is the input string
   - `T` is an empty list

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-2`, so for the next iteration, `i` should be `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to `n-1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is a condition for the loop but not modified within the loop itself.

5. **Other states remain the same**:
   - `a` is not directly affected by the loop head.
   - `result` is not directly affected by the loop head.
   - `t` is not directly affected by the loop head.
   - `line` is not directly affected by the loop head.
   - `T` is not directly affected by the loop head.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is `[1000, a[n-3] - T[n-3], a[i-1] - T[i-1]]`, `result` is an empty string, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be non-zero, `line` is the input string, `T` is an empty list**
