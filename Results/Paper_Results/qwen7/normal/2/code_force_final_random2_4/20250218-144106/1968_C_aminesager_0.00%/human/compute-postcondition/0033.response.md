Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than the input integer, `a` is a list where the first element `a[0]` is `1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])`, and every subsequent element `a[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n-2`) is `a[j-1] - T[j-1]`, and the list `a` is reversed; `result` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `a` with spaces.**

Explanation: The code `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` does not change the values of `i`, `n`, or `a`. Instead, it creates a new variable `result` which is a string formed by converting each element of the list `a` to a string and joining them with spaces. The list `a` remains unchanged and is still reversed as per the initial state.
