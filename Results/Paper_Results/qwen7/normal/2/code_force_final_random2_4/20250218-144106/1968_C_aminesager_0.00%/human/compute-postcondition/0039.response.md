Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element `a[0]` is `1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])`, and every subsequent element `a[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n-2`) is `a[j-1] - T[j-1]`, and the list `a` is reversed; `result` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `a` with spaces; `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be non-zero; `line` is the input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string `line` and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` splits the input string `line` into a list of substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns this list to `T`. The other variables remain unchanged.
