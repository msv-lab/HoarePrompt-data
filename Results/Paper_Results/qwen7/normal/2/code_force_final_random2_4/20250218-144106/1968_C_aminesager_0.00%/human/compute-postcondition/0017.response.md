Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`, where `n` must be greater than 1.
   - The list `a` is represented as a space-separated string of its elements, each being a string conversion of `1000 - sum(T)` reversed.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is `n-1`, so if `n` is 2 (the minimum value since it must be greater than 1), then `i` would be 1.
   - The list `a` is constructed from a string where each element is `1000 - sum(T)` reversed. Since `T` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `sum(T)`, but we know that each element in the list `a` is a string representation of this reversed value.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(result)`, but `result` is not defined in the given initial state. Therefore, there is no variable named `result` to print.

Given the information provided, we can conclude that the variable `result` is not defined, and thus the print statement will raise an error or print nothing if `result` is not assigned a value.

Output: **nothing printed (since result is not defined)**
