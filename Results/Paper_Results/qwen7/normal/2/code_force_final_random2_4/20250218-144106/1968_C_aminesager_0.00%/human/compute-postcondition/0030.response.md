Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than the input integer, `a` is a list starting with 1000 and followed by `n-1` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-2`) is calculated as `a[j] - T[j]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The list `a` starts with the initial value 1000 and each subsequent element is derived by subtracting the corresponding value from the list `T` from the previous element in `a`. The length of the list `a` will be `n`, including the initial value.
