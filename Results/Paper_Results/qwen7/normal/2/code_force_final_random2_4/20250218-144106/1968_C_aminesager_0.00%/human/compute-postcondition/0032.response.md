Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than the input integer, `a` is a list where the first element `a[0]` is `1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])`, and every subsequent element `a[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n-2`) is `a[j-1] - T[j-1]`, and the list `a` is reversed.**

Explanation: The code `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. Since the original list `a` was defined such that `a[0]` is `1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])` and each subsequent element `a[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n-2`) is `a[j-1] - T[j-1]`, reversing the list does not change the values of the elements themselves, only their order. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and the elements of `a` remain the same as before the reversal, but the list `a` is now in reverse order.
