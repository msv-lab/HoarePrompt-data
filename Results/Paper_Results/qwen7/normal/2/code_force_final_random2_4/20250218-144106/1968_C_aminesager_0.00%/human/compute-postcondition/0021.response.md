Output State: **`i` is an input integer - 1, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, and `line` is the input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `line = input('')` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state of `a` is not directly affected by this line of code, but it is mentioned in the initial state and remains unchanged unless further operations are performed on it.
