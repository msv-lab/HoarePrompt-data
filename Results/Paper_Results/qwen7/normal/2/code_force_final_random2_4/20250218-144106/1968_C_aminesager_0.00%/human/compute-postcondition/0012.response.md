Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` contains an element which is a[2] - T[2]**.

Explanation: The code snippet `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` appends to the list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[2]` and `T[i - 1]` refers to `T[2]`. Since `i` is 3, `n` must still be greater than 3 as no operation changes its value. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in `a` calculated as `a[2] - T[2]`.
