Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.**

Explanation: The line `s = min(m, k)` assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to the variable `s`. Since the initial values of `i` and `n` are unchanged, they remain as `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1. The value of `s` is determined by comparing `m` and `k`, but the specific value of `s` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `m` and `k`.
