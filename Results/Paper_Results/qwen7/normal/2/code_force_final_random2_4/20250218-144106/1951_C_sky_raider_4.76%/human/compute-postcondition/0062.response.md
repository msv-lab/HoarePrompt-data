Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its intended iterations. The variable `n` must be at least 3 since the loop runs based on the value of `n`. The variable `c` will hold the cumulative sum of the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`.
