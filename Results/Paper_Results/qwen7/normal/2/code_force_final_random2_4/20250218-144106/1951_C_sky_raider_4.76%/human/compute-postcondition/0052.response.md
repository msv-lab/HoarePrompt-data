Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is `c + l[0] * s - s * s / 2`**.

The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is set to 0 and there is no operation that would alter its value. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid. The variable `c` is updated by adding the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value, where `i` is 0. Therefore, the new value of `c` is the original value of `c` plus `l[0] * s - s * s / 2`.
