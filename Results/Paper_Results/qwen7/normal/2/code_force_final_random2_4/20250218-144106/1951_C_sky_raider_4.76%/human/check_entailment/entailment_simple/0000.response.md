Reasoning:
1. The program iterates through each test case, reading the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) for each case.
2. It then reads a list of ticket prices for \( n \) days.
3. The list of prices is sorted.
4. The program initializes a variable `s` to \( k \) and subtracts the minimum of \( m \) and \( k \) from \( k \) in each iteration.
5. It calculates the cost of buying tickets on the current day and updates the cumulative cost `c`.
6. The formula used to calculate the cost is \( l[i] * s - s * s / 2 \), which seems to be an attempt to account for the increasing price due to purchasing tickets on previous days.

However, the formula \( c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2 \) does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. Specifically, the term \( -s * s / 2 \) is unnecessary and incorrect because the problem statement indicates that the price increases linearly with the number of tickets purchased on a given day, not quadratically.

The correct approach would be to simply add the cost of tickets bought on the current day without any additional terms.

Let's correct the logic:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l.sort()
        
        c = 0
        
        while k > 0:
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l.pop(0) * s
        
        print(int(c))
```

With this corrected logic, the program should correctly compute the minimum cost to buy \( k \) tickets.

Correctness: **False**

The original program uses an incorrect formula and does not properly account for the increasing ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a given day.
