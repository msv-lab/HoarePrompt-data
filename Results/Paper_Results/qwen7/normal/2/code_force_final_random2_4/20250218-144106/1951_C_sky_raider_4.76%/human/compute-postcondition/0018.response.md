Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `k - n * s`, `s` is `min(m, k - s)`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` must have been greater than 0 for the loop to run at all. The variable `c` will hold the cumulative value of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`. The variable `k` will be reduced by `n * s` where `s` is updated to `min(m, k - s)` after each iteration.
