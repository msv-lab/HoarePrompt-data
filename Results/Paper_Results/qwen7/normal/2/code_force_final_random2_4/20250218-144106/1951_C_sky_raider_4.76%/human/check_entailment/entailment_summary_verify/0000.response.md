### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to minimize the cost of purchasing exactly `k` tickets over `n` days.
- Each day, the price per ticket can be increased by the number of tickets purchased on that day.
- We can purchase at most `m` tickets per day.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        s = 0
        c = k * k / 2
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
        print(int(c))
```

#### Key Observations:
1. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list of ticket prices, which is unnecessary since we are iterating through the list in order.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program incorrectly updates the cumulative cost `c` using the formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. This formula is not consistent with the problem requirements.
3. **Price Update Logic**: The program does not correctly update the ticket prices for subsequent days based on the number of tickets purchased on the current day.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate through the list of ticket prices.
2. For each day, determine the number of tickets to purchase (`s`).
3. Update the remaining tickets (`k`) and the cumulative cost (`c`).
4. Update the ticket prices for subsequent days based on the number of tickets purchased on the current day.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the input:
```
3 2 3
8 6 4
```

- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets (minimum of `m` and `k`).
  - Cost: 8 * 2 = 16
  - Remaining tickets: 3 - 2 = 1
  - Updated prices: [10, 4]
- Day 2: Buy 1 ticket.
  - Cost: 4 * 1 = 4
  - Remaining tickets: 1 - 1 = 0
  - Total cost: 16 + 4 = 20

The correct cost is 20, but the provided program calculates the cost incorrectly.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It does not properly update the ticket prices for subsequent days based on the number of tickets purchased on the current day. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
