Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer - `n * s`, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `s` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `c` is `k * k / 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates `c` to `k * k / 2`. The value of `s` remains 0, and the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and the expression for `c` are as described in the initial state.
