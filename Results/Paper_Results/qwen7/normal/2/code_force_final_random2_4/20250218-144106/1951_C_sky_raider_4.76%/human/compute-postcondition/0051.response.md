Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - s`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by the value of `s`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `s` is still the minimum value between `m` and `k`, but since `k` has been updated, `s` might also be different now depending on the values of `m` and the new value of `k`. However, the exact value of `s` is not specified, so we only state that `s` is the minimum value between `m` and the new value of `k`.
