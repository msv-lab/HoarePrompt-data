t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ \min(nm, 10^9). a is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.
