Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only variables mentioned in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter. It starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is an input integer (initial value unknown).
   - `n` is the first input integer.
   - `m` is the second input integer (not used in the loop).
   - `k` is the third input integer (not used in the loop).
   - `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (not used in the loop).
   - `s` is 0 (not used in the loop).
   - `c` is `k * k / 2` (not used in the loop).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must start from 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

The final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
