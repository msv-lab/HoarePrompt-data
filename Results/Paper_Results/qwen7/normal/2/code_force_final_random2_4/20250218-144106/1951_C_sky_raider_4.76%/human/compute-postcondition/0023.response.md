Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is updated to `k - n * s`, `s` is `min(m, k - n * s)`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input split by spaces and converts each element into an integer, storing them in the list `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information is the list `l` which now holds the integers from the input.
