Output State: `ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s`, and `s` is the final string left after all occurrences of 'map' have been removed.

To elaborate, the loop continues to run as long as the substring 'map' is found within `s`. Each iteration removes the first occurrence of 'map' from `s` and increments the counter `ans` by 1. After all iterations, `ans` will hold the total count of how many times 'map' was found and removed, and `s` will be the string that remains after all such substrings have been removed.
