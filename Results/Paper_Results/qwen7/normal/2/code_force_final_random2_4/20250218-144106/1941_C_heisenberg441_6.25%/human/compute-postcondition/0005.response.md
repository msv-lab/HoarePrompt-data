Output State: **`ans` is 0, `s` is a string without the substring 'map' starting from the first occurrence of 'map' and ending before the last character of 'map'**.

Explanation: The code replaces the substring 'map' in `s` with an empty string, effectively removing it. The `ans` variable remains unchanged as it was not affected by the operation. The new value of `s` is the original string `s` but with 'map' removed starting from the first occurrence of 'map' and ending just before the last character of 'map'.
