Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `s.find('pie') != -1`. This means the loop will continue as long as the substring 'pie' is found in the string `s`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 1.
   - `s` now does not contain the substring 'pie'.

3. **Determine What Needs to Change**: For the loop to execute one more time, the substring 'pie' must be found in `s`. Since `s` currently does not contain 'pie', we need to adjust the state such that 'pie' is present in `s` before the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure that the substring 'pie' is found in `s` during the next iteration, we need to add 'pie' back into `s`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `s` contains the substring 'pie' before the next iteration of the loop.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 1, and `s` must contain the substring 'pie'**.
