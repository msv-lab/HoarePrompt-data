Output State: `ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from `s`, and `s` is the final string left after all occurrences of 'map' have been removed.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'map' is found in `s`. Each iteration removes the first occurrence of 'map' from `s` and increments `ans` by 1. After all iterations, `ans` will be the count of how many times 'map' was found and removed, and `s` will be the string left after all such removals.
