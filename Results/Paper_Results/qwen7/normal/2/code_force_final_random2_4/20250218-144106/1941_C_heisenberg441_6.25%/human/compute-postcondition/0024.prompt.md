Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s`, and `s` is the final string left after all occurrences of 'map' have been removed.

To elaborate, the loop continues to run as long as the substring 'map' is found within `s`. Each iteration removes the first occurrence of 'map' from `s` and increments the counter `ans` by 1. After all iterations, `ans` will hold the total count of how many times 'map' was found and removed, and `s` will be the string that remains after all such substrings have been removed.
Code of the loop:
while s.find('pie') != -1:
    s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
    ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 1, and `s` now does not contain the substring 'pie'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 2, `s` now does not contain the substring 'pie', and the substring 'pie' has been replaced with an empty string.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 3, `s` is the original string `s` without the substring 'pie' starting from the first occurrence of 'pie' and including the next two characters.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
