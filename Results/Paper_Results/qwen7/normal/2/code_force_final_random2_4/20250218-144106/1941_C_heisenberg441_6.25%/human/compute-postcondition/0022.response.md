Output State: **`ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 2 minus 1; `s` is the original string `s` without the substring 'pie' starting from the first occurrence of 'pie' and including the next two characters.**

Explanation: The code removes the substring 'pie' from the original string `s`. Since `ans` is initially the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 2, removing 'pie' does not affect the count of 'map' removals, so `ans` is decreased by 1. The string `s` is updated to exclude the substring 'pie' starting from its first occurrence and including the next two characters.
