### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it "beautiful". A string is "beautiful" if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.
   
3. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis**:
   - The function checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". This check is unnecessary and incorrect because it should handle the removal of "map" and "pie" directly.
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of deletions.
   - It uses two while loops to find and remove occurrences of "map" and "pie":
     - For "map": It finds the first occurrence of "map" and removes it by slicing the string before and after "map".
     - For "pie": It finds the first occurrence of "pie" and removes it similarly.
   - Each time a substring is found and removed, `ans` is incremented.

4. **Issues Identified**:
   - The check `if s == 'mapie':` is unnecessary and incorrect. This condition should be handled by the removal logic.
   - The function correctly removes "map" and "pie" but does not handle the case where both substrings might overlap or appear multiple times efficiently.
   - The function does not account for overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". For example, in the string "mapmap", the function would remove "map" twice, but it should only count it once.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The function logic is almost correct but needs a more robust approach to ensure all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are removed efficiently without redundant checks. Specifically, the function should handle overlapping occurrences correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" efficiently. The function should be modified to ensure that each occurrence of "map" and "pie" is counted and removed only once, even if they overlap.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the handling of overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie".
