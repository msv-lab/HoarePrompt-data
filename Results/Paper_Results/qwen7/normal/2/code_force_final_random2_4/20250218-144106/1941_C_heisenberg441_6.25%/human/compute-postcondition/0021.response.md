The loop condition is `s.find('pie') != -1`, which means the loop will continue as long as the substring 'pie' is found in the string `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 2.
- `s` now does not contain the substring 'pie'.
- The substring 'pie' has been replaced with an empty string.

For the loop to execute one more time, the substring 'pie' must be present in the string `s`. Since the substring 'pie' has already been replaced with an empty string, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that 'pie' is present again.

To achieve this, we need to revert the replacement of 'pie' with an empty string and ensure that 'pie' is present in `s` before the loop starts.

State: **`ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 2, `s` contains the substring 'pie', and the substring 'pie' has not been replaced with an empty string**.
