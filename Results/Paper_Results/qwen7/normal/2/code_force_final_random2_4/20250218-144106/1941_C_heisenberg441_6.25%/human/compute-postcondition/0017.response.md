Output State: **`ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 1, and `s` now does not contain the substring 'pie'.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, indicating one more occurrence of the substring 'map' has been found and removed from the string `s`. The condition that `s` does not contain the substring 'pie' remains unchanged.
