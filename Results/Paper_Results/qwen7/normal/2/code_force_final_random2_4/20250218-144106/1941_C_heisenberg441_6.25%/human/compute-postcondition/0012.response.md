Output State: **`ans` is 3, `s` is the substring from the start of `s` to the character right before 'm', followed by the substring from the character right after 'p' to the end of `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The value of `s` remains unchanged as the code snippet only modifies `ans`.
