Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1(s)` aims to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string `s` beautiful. It checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" and removes them iteratively until no more occurrences are found. The function correctly increments the counter `ans` each time it finds and removes an instance of "map" or "pie".

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the string "mapie", the function correctly returns 1 because it only needs to remove one character ("a") to make it beautiful.
   - For strings containing multiple "map" or "pie" substrings, the function correctly counts and removes each occurrence, updating `ans` accordingly.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The function uses `s.find('map')` and `s.find('pie')` to locate the first occurrence of these substrings. This ensures that the removal process is done efficiently without unnecessary re-computation.
   - The function handles all possible input strings as per the problem constraints (length up to \(10^6\)).

4. **Output**:
   - The function correctly returns the total count of characters removed to make the string beautiful. If the string is already beautiful, it returns 0.

Given the above analysis, the function logic and implementation appear to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
