Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" but does not account for overlapping occurrences of these substrings. For example, in the string "mapmapmapmapmapmap", the program should remove 6 characters to make the string beautiful, but it only removes 4 characters because it does not properly handle overlapping occurrences. 

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it removes the minimum number of characters even when there are overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". The current implementation only removes the first occurrence of each substring found, which may not result in the minimum number of deletions required.
