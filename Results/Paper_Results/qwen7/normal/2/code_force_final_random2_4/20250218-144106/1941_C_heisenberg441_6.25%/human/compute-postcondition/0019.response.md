Output State: **`ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 1, `s` now does not contain the substring 'pie', and the substring 'pie' has been replaced with an empty string.**

Explanation: The code removes the substring 'pie' from the original string `s` by slicing the string before the first occurrence of 'pie' and after the first occurrence of 'pie' plus two characters. This operation effectively removes 'pie' from the string. The value of `ans` remains unchanged because the code does not modify the count of 'map' found and removed from the string.
