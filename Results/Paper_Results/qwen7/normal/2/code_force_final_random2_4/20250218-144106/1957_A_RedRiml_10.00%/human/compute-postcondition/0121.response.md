Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` from the list `palka`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `palka`.

3. **Analyze the postconditions**:
   - `d.get(i)` is updated to either 1 (if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`) or incremented by 1 (if `d.get(i)` was not `None`).
   - If `i` is not in `pl`, then `i` is added to `pl`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `palka`, the value of `i` changes with each iteration.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` has been processed, and `d.get(i)` has been updated accordingly.
   - If `i` was not in `pl` before, it has now been added to `pl`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The value of `i` will change to the next element in `palka`.
   - The dictionary `d` will have `d.get(i)` updated.
   - The list `pl` will include `i` if it was not already present.

Given the above analysis, let's assume that the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration was `i_val` (which we don't know explicitly but can denote as such).

**Step-by-step adjustment**:
- `i` will be set to the next element in `palka`.
- `d.get(i)` will be updated according to the rules mentioned.
- `pl` will include `i` if it was not already in `pl`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we'll denote it as `i_val` and proceed with the general form.

**Final State**:
- `i` will be the next element in `palka` after `i_val`.
- `d.get(i)` will be updated to either 1 (if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`) or incremented by 1 (if `d.get(i)` was not `None`).
- `pl` will include `i` if it was not already in `pl`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`, `d.get(i)` is either 1 (if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`) or incremented by 1 (if `d.get(i)` was not `None`), and `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`**.
