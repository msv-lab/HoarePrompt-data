Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `palka`. The values of `t`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged from their initial states.
