Output State: **`i` is the next element in `palka`, `next_i` is the same as `i`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. The variables `i` and `next_i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still the next element in `palka`, `next_i` is still the same as `i`, and `d[i]` is now one more than its original value.
