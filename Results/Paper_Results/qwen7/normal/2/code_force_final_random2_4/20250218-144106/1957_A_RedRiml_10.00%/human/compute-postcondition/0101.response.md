Based on the initial state provided:

- `shapes` is 3.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key from the list `palka` is mapped to its count in `palka`.
- `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared.

The `print(shapes)` statement will simply print the value of the variable `shapes`.
