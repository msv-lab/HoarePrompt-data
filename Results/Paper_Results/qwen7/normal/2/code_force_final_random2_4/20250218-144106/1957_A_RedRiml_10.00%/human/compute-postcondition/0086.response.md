Output State: **`shapes` is 0, `d` is a dictionary where each key from the list `palka` is mapped to its count in `palka`, and `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared.**

Explanation: The code `shapes = 0` simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `shapes`. It does not affect the dictionary `d` or the list `pl`. Therefore, the dictionary `d` and the list `pl` remain unchanged from their initial state.
