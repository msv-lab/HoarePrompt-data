Output State: **A dictionary `d` where each key from the list `palka` is mapped to its count in `palka`, and a list `pl` containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the dictionary `d` will contain each unique element from the list `palka` as a key, with the corresponding value being the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`. The list `pl` will contain all the unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared. This is because each element `i` from `palka` is processed in the loop, and if `i` is not already in `pl`, it gets appended to `pl`.
