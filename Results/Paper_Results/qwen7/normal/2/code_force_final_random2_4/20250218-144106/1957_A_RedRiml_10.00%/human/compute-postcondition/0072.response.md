Postcondition: `d` is a dictionary, `i` is `next_i`. If the key `next_i` does not exist in `d`, it is added with a value of 1. If the key `next_i` exists in `d` and its value is 1, it remains unchanged. If the key `next_i` exists in `d` and its value is not 1, it is incremented by 1. If the key `next_i` does not exist in `d`, it is added with a value of 2. If the key `next_i` exists in `d` and its value is not 2, it is incremented by 1.
