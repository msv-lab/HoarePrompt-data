Output State: **Postcondition: `shapes` is equal to the number of elements in `pl`, `pl` must contain only indices where the corresponding value in `d` is greater than or equal to 3.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `shapes` will hold the total count of elements in the list `pl` for which the condition `d[j] >= 3` is true. The list `pl` should only contain indices that satisfy this condition, and no other elements outside of `pl` should affect the final value of `shapes`.
