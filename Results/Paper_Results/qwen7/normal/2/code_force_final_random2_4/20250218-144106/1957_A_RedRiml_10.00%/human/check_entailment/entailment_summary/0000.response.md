Reasoning:
- The program correctly processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`n`) and their lengths.
- It uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each stick length.
- It then iterates over the unique stick lengths and checks if the count of each length is at least 3.
- If the count is at least 3, it increments the `shapes` counter.
- Finally, it prints the value of `shapes`, which represents the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the program logic appears to match the requirements. It correctly counts the number of unique stick lengths that can form at least one regular polygon (since each polygon requires at least 3 sides).

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
