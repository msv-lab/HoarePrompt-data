You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        print(shapes)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `w` representing the number of test cases, followed by `w` sets of inputs. Each set includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths. It then calculates and prints the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times in the input list for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of sticks and then reads a list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Frequencies:**
   - It uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It also creates a list `pl` of unique stick lengths.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Polygons:**
   - The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length `j`, if the frequency `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, it increments the counter `shapes` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the value of `shapes` for each test case.

### Checking Against the Problem Description

- **Test Cases Handling:** The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating `w` times.
- **Stick Lengths and Frequencies:** The program correctly counts the frequency of each stick length.
- **Polygon Formation:** The program correctly checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length to form a polygon. However, this logic only considers forming polygons with the minimum required number of sides (3 for triangles). It does not account for forming larger polygons like squares, pentagons, etc., which require more sticks.
- **Output:** The program outputs the correct number of polygons that can be formed for each test case.

### Example Analysis

Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1`
   - `1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Only one stick, so no polygon can be formed.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2`
   - `1 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Two sticks of length 1, but not enough to form any polygon.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `6`
   - `2 2 3 3 3 3`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Four sticks of length 3 can form a square.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `9`
   - `4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Two sets of four sticks of length 2 can form two separate squares, and four sticks of length 4 can form one pentagon.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks. It correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.
