Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the range function, which takes an integer `w`. The loop variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable when the loop variable itself is not needed) iterates from 0 to `w-1`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `w` must be greater than the current value of the loop variable `_`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, the key condition here is whether `w` is greater than the current value of `_`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `shapes` is 3
   - `j` is 3
   - Every element `j` in the list `pl` satisfies `d[j] >= 3`

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, it does not affect the state directly. However, the loop can continue if `w` is greater than the current value of `_`. Given that `_` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the loop can continue if `w` is greater than 3.

5. **New State**: To allow the loop to execute one more time, `w` must be greater than 3. The values of `shapes` and `j` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the new state should reflect that `w` must be greater than 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`shapes` is 3, `j` is 3, and `w` must be greater than 3**
