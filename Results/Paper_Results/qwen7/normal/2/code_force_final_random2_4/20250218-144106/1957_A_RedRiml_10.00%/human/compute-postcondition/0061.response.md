Output State: **`d` is a dictionary, `i` is a key in `d`, and the value of `d.get(i)` is now the original value plus 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value associated with key `i` in dictionary `d` by 1. Since the initial value of `d.get(i)` is not None, it is updated to its original value plus 1. The other conditions and the dictionary structure remain unchanged.
