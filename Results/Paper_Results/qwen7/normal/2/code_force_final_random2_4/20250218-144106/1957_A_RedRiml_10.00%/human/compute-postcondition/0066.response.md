Output State: **`d` is a dictionary; `i` does not exist in `d`; `pl` is a list containing the value `i`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `i` does not exist in `d` initially, the dictionary `d` remains unchanged. The list `pl` now contains the value `i`.
