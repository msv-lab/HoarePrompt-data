Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `shapes` is 3, `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is an empty list, `w` is decremented by 1, `palka` is updated to a list of integers based on user input.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `palka` is a list of integers, and `d.get(i)` is either 1 (if `d.get(i)` was initially None) or incremented by 1 (if `d.get(i)` was not None). If `i` is not in `pl`, then `i` is added to `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `d.get(i)` is either 1 (if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`) or incremented by 1 (if `d.get(i)` was not `None`), `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`, and `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`. If `i` was not in `pl` before the execution of the if statement, then `pl` now includes `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `d.get(i)` is either 1 or incremented by 1, `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`, and `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`. After executing the if-else block, `d.get(i)` is either 1 or incremented by 1, `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`, and `pl` now includes `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
