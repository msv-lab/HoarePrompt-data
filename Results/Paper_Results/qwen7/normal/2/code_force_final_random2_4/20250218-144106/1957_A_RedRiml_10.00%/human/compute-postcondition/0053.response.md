Output State: **`shapes` is 3, `j` is 3, `w` must be greater than 3, `ln` is an input integer.**

The code `ln = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `ln`. The initial values of `shapes`, `j`, and `w` remain unchanged, and the condition for `w` still holds true. The output state includes the new variable `ln` which is an integer obtained from user input.
