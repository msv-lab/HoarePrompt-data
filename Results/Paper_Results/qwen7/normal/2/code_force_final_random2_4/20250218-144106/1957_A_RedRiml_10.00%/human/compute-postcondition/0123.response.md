Output State: **`d.get(i)` is incremented by 1, `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`, and `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d.get(i)` by 1. Since `d.get(i)` was either 1 (if it was initially `None`) or incremented by 1 (if it was not `None`), it is now incremented by 1 again. The values of `i` and `pl` remain unchanged from their initial states.
