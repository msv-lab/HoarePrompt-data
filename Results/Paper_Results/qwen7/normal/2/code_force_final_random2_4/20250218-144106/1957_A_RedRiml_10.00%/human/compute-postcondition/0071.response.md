Output State: **`d` is a dictionary, `i` is `next_i`, if the key `next_i` does not exist in `d`, it is added with a value of 2, if the key `next_i` exists in `d` and its value is not 2, its value is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` (which is `next_i`) in the dictionary `d`. If `next_i` does not exist in `d`, it is added with a value of 1, but since the code increments it by 1, it effectively adds a value of 2. If `next_i` already exists in `d` and its value is not 1, the value is incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, in both cases, the value associated with `next_i` in `d` becomes 2.
