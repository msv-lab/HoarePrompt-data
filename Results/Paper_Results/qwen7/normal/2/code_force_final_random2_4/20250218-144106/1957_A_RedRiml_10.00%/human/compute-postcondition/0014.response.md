Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list with at least one element, `d` is a dictionary. The first element of `palka` is not in `pl`. If the first element of `palka` is in `d`, then `d[first_element_of_palka]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `d[first_element_of_palka]` is incremented by `1`.
