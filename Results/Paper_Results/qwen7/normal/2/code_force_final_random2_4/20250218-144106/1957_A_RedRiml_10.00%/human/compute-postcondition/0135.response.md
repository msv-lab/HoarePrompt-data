Postcondition: `d.get(i)` is either 1 or incremented by 1, `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`, and `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`. If `i` was not in `pl` before the execution of the if-else block, then `d.get(i)` is set to 1 and `pl` includes `i`. Otherwise, `d.get(i)` is incremented by 1 and `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`.
