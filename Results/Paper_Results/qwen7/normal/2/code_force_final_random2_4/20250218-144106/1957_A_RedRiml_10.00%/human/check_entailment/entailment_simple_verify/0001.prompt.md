You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        print(shapes)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list of stick lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n consists of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: Output State: `shapes` is equal to the number of unique elements in `palka` whose count in `d` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is a dictionary where each key from the list `palka` is mapped to its count in `palka`, and `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `shapes` will be equal to the number of unique elements in `palka` whose count in the dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3. The dictionary `d` will hold the counts of each key from the list `palka`, and the list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, as no modifications are made to `pl` within the loop body other than appending new unique elements.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of sticks and then reads a list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Frequencies:**
   - It uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It also creates a list `pl` of unique stick lengths.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Polygons:**
   - The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length `j`, if the frequency `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, it increments the counter `shapes` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the value of `shapes` for each test case.

### Checking Against the Problem Description

- **Test Cases Handling:** The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating `w` times.
- **Stick Lengths and Frequencies:** The program correctly counts the frequency of each stick length.
- **Polygon Formation:** The program correctly checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length to form a polygon. However, this logic only considers forming polygons with the minimum required number of sides (3 for triangles). It does not account for forming larger polygons like squares, pentagons, etc., which require more sticks.
- **Output:** The program outputs the correct number of polygons that can be formed for each test case.

### Example Analysis

Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1`
   - `1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Only one stick, so no polygon can be formed.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2`
   - `1 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Two sticks of length 1, but not enough to form any polygon.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `6`
   - `2 2 3 3 3 3`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Four sticks of length 3 can form a square.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `9`
   - `4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Two sets of four sticks of length 2 can form two separate squares, and four sticks of length 4 can form one pentagon.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks. It correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.
