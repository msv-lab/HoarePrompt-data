Output State: **`shapes` is 3, `j` is 3, `w` must be greater than 3, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in the variable `palka`. The initial values of `shapes`, `j`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged.
