Output State: `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B` from index `n - k` to the end of the list, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `lista_A` remains the same, `lista_B` remains the same, `pref` remains the same, `i` is the last value it was set to within the range `[n - k, n)`, `resultado` is the minimum value it was updated to during the loop, which is the minimum of `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for all iterations of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `soma_b` will be the sum of all elements in `lista_B` starting from index `n - k` to the end of the list. The variable `resultado` will hold the smallest value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop, considering the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `pref`, and `i`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
