Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` (with the condition 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` each containing `n` integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. It processes these inputs by comparing elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B` in reverse order, calculating a cumulative sum (`soma_b`) of elements in `lista_B` and determining a prefix sum (`pref`) based on certain conditions. Finally, it computes the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for specific indices and prints this minimum value.**
