Output State: **`soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]`, `pref` remains unchanged, `i` is `m + 2` where `m` is the current value of `i` from the previous iteration and `m + 2 < n - k`.**

Explanation: The code `soma_b += lista_B[i]` increases the value of `soma_b` by `lista_B[i]`. Since `pref` is determined by the condition `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, and the code does not change this condition, `pref` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is updated to `m + 2` where `m` is the current value of `i` from the previous iteration, and the condition `m + 2 < n - k` must still hold true.
