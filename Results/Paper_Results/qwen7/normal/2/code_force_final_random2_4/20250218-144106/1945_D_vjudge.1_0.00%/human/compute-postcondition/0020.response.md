Output State: **`soma_b` is an integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` or `0` if `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `i` is `m + 1` where `m` is the current value of `i` from the previous iteration and `m + 1 < n - k`, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `soma_b` by adding the value of `lista_B[i]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `i` is updated to `m + 1` where `m` was the previous value of `i` and `m + 1 < n - k`.
