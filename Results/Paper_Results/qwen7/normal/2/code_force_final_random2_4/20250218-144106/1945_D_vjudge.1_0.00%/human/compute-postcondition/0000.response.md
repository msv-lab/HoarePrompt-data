Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `numero_testes` ≤ 10^4, and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

This means that `numero_testes` has been updated to the integer value entered by the user through the input function, while the conditions 1 ≤ `numero_testes` ≤ 10^4 still hold true. All other variables remain in their initial state as no operations have been performed on them yet.
