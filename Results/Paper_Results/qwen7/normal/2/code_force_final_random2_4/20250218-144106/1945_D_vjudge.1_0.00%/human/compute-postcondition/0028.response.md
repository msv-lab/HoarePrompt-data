Postcondition: `soma_b` is an integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` or `0` if `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `i` is `m + 2` where `m` is the current value of `i` from the previous iteration and `m + 2 < n - k`. If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, `soma_b` remains unchanged and `pref` is set to `soma_b + lista_A[i]`. Otherwise, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]` and `pref` remains unchanged.
