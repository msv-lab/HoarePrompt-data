The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), and two lists \(a\) and \(b\). It then calls `func_1()` exactly `numero_testes` times, where `numero_testes` is initially read from input and must be between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. After processing all test cases, `numero_testes` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1,000 inclusive, but it will always be greater than 2. The function does not return any value.
