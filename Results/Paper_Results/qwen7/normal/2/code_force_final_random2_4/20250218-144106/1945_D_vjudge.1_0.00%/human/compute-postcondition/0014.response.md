Postcondition: `soma_b` is the sum of elements from `lista_A` and `lista_B` based on the following rules: if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, then `soma_b` is updated by adding `lista_A[i]` to it; otherwise, `soma_b` is updated by adding `lista_B[i]`. `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, and `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if the condition in the if statement is true or 0 if the condition is false.
