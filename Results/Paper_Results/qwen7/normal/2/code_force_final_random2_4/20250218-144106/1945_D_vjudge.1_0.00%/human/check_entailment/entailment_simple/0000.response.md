### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function reads input values for `n` and `k`, followed by two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
   - It reverses these lists, which is unnecessary since the problem does not require the lists to be in reverse order.
   - It initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.
   - It iterates through the first `n - k` elements of the reversed lists, updating `pref` and `soma_b` based on conditions involving `lista_A[i]` and `lista_B[i]`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining elements from `n - k` to `n - 1`, updating `soma_b` and `resultado` accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value stored in `resultado`.

2. **Function `func_2()` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases, `numero_testes`.
   - It calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The state after the loop indicates that `func_1()` is called exactly `numero_testes` times.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions by considering the costs associated with swapping positions.
   - The logic in `func_2()` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one.
   - There are no logical errors or inefficiencies in the provided code that would cause incorrect results.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
