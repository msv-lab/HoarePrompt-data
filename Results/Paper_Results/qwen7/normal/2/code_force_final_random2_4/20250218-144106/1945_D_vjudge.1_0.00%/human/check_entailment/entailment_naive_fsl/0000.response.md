Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not accurately calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Costs**: The program attempts to reverse the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which is unnecessary and does not align with the problem description. The costs should be calculated from the start to the end of the queue, not reversed.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Costs**: The logic for calculating the total cost is flawed. The program does not properly account for the cumulative cost of bribing people between positions. It should consider the cost of bribing each person and the subsequent cost of bribing people between the current position and the target position.

3. **Incorrect Final Cost Calculation**: The final cost calculation in the loop is incorrect. It should consider the cumulative cost of bribing people from the current position to the target position, not just the last element added to `pref`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  4
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```

- **Expected Output**: The minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first 2 people is 14. This can be achieved by bribing the person at position 3 with 8 coins and the person at position 2 with 3 coins.

However, the provided program does not produce the correct output. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the prefix sum of b_i
    prefix_sum_b = [0] * n
    prefix_sum_b[0] = lista_B[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        prefix_sum_b[i] = prefix_sum_b[i-1] + lista_B[i]
    
    # Initialize the result with infinity
    resultado = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate from n-k to n (Kirill's target position)
    for i in range(n-k, n):
        # Calculate the cost of bribing up to position i
        cost = lista_A[i] + prefix_sum_b[i-1] if i > 0 else lista_A[i]
        resultado = min(resultado, cost)
    
    print(resultado)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the minimum cost by considering the cumulative costs and ensuring Kirill is among the first `m` people in the queue.
