Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is mentioned in the loop head.
   - The loop runs from `n - k` to `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`:**
   - According to the loop, the initial value of `i` should be `n - k - 1` (as given in the state before the loop).

3. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[n - k, n)`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to `n - k - 1` at the start of the loop.
   - We also need to ensure that `i` remains within the valid range for the loop to continue executing.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `n - k - 1`.
- `i` should remain within the range `[n - k, n)` during the loop execution.

Therefore, the modified state is:

**State: **`soma_b` is an integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` or `0` if `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `resultado` is positive infinity, `i` must be within the range `[n - k, n)`**.
