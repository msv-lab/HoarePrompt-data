Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `mexsize` is incremented by 1 for each element in `a` that equals `mexsize`, the final value of `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `t` remains unchanged, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `mexsize`, `tc`, `n`, `t`, and `maxsize` remain unchanged. The sorting operation affects only the list `a`.
