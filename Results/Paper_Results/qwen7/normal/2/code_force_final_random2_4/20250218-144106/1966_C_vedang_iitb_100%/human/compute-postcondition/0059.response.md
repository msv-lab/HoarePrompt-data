Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, `mexsize` is updated to the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `t` remains unchanged, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is either greater than `maxsize` or less than or equal to `maxsize` (depending on the original values of `mexsize` and `maxsize`).**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`mexsize`, `tc`, `n`, `t`, `maxsize`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `mexsize` is updated to the smallest positive integer not present in the sorted list `a`, and `tc` is incremented by 1.
