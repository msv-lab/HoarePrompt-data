Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the game logic. Specifically, the solution attempts to find the minimum excluded value (mex) of the sorted array, which is not the correct approach for this game. Instead, the correct strategy involves using the Nim-sum (bitwise XOR of all pile sizes) to determine the winner.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for sz in a:
            nim_sum ^= sz
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print("Bob")
        else:
            print("Alice")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy; otherwise, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy.
