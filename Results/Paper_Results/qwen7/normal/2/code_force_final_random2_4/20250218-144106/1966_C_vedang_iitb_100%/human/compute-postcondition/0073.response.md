Output State: **All elements from the list `a` have been iterated over, `sz` is now the last element of the original list `a`, `mexsize` has been incremented for each occurrence where `sz` equals `mexsize`, and `a` is now an empty list.**

In this final state, the loop has iterated over every element in the original list `a`. The variable `sz` takes on the value of each element in `a` in sequence. For each iteration, if `sz` equals `mexsize`, `mexsize` is incremented. After all iterations, `a` will be empty since all elements have been processed, and `mexsize` will have been incremented for each match between `sz` and `mexsize` during the loop's execution.
