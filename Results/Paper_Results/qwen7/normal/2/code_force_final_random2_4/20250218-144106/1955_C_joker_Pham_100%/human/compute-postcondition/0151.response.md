Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k - 2 \cdot a_r \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is incremented by 1, `r` is either unchanged or decremented by 1, `sunks` is increased by 1, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, and `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`.
