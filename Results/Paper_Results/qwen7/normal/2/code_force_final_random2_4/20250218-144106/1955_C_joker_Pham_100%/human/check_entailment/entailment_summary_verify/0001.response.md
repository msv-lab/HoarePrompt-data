### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`. It also reads the durabilities of the ships `a`.
   - This part of the program is correct.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(n, k, list(a))` which processes the data and returns the number of sunk ships.
   - This part of the program is correct.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) to track the current positions of the first and last ships.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the attacks.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `k` is zero, breaking the loop if true.
   - It handles the case where `l` and `r` are at the same position separately.
   - It then checks which ship (first or last) has lower durability and simulates the attacks accordingly.
     - If the durability of the left ship is less than or equal to the right ship, it checks if there are enough attacks to sink the left ship completely. If so, it reduces the durability of the right ship and increments the count of sunk ships. If not, it breaks the loop.
     - If the durability of the right ship is less than the left ship, it performs similar checks but for the right ship.
   - The loop continues until either all ships are sunk or there are no more attacks left.

   However, there are several issues with the logic:
   - The function does not correctly handle the case where multiple ships can be attacked in a single iteration. For example, if the durability of the left ship is 1 and the right ship is 2, and `k` is 3, the function should reduce the durability of both ships by 1, but it only reduces the right ship by 2.
   - The function does not correctly handle the case where the durability of the left and right ships are both reduced in a single iteration. For example, if the durability of the left ship is 1 and the right ship is 2, and `k` is 3, the function should reduce the durability of both ships by 1, but it only reduces the right ship by 2.
   - The function does not correctly handle the case where the durability of the left and right ships are both reduced in a single iteration. For example, if the durability of the left ship is 1 and the right ship is 2, and `k` is 3, the function should reduce the durability of both ships by 1, but it only reduces the right ship by 2.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic correctly handles the case where the durability of the left and right ships is the same.
   - The logic also correctly handles the case where one ship is sunk before the next attack, adjusting the pointers accordingly.
   - The logic ensures that once a ship is sunk, it is no longer considered in future attacks.

   However, the edge cases are not handled correctly as explained above.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the number of sunk ships, which is printed for each test case.

   Given the issues with the logic, the function does not correctly simulate the attacks and count the number of sunk ships.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the attacks and count the number of sunk ships. Specifically, it does not handle the case where multiple ships can be attacked in a single iteration and does not correctly reduce the durability of both ships when necessary.
