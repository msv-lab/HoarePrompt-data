You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`. It also reads the durabilities of the ships `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(n, k, list(a))` which processes the data and returns the number of sunk ships.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) to track the current positions of the first and last ships.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the attacks.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `k` is zero, breaking the loop if true.
   - It handles the case where `l` and `r` are at the same position separately.
   - It then checks which ship (first or last) has lower durability and simulates the attacks accordingly.
     - If the durability of the left ship is less than or equal to the right ship, it checks if there are enough attacks to sink the left ship completely. If so, it reduces the durability of the right ship and increments the count of sunk ships. If not, it breaks the loop.
     - If the durability of the right ship is less than the left ship, it performs similar checks but for the right ship.
   - The loop continues until either all ships are sunk or there are no more attacks left.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic correctly handles the case where the durability of the left and right ships is the same.
   - The logic also correctly handles the case where one ship is sunk before the next attack, adjusting the pointers accordingly.
   - The logic ensures that once a ship is sunk, it is no longer considered in future attacks.

5. **Output**: The function returns the number of sunk ships, which is printed for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken.
