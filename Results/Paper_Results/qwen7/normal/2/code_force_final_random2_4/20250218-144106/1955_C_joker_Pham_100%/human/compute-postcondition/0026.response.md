Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` is now n - 2, `sunks` is equal to `sunks + 2`, and the value of `a[r]` is 0.**

The variable `l` is incremented by 1, making `l` equal to its original value plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
