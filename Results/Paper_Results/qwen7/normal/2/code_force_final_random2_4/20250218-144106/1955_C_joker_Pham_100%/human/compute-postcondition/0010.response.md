Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 1, and the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to the last element of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The variable `sunks` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
