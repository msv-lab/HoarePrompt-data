The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the variables `l`, `r`, `sunks`, and `a` are updated as described, but no further action is taken within the scope of a loop. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the `continue` statement.

- `l` is incremented by 1.
- `r` is decremented by 1.
- `sunks` is increased by 1.
- `l` is set to `l + 1`.

Since these changes are made outside of a loop, the only effect is the direct assignment to `l`. The other variables retain their initial values from the precondition.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\) decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is incremented by 2, `r` is decremented by 1, `sunks` is increased by 1.**
