Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`. It also reads the durabilities of the ships `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(n, k, list(a))` which processes the data and returns the number of sunk ships.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) to track the current positions of the first and last ships.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the attacks.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `k` is zero, breaking the loop if true.
   - It handles the case where `l` and `r` are at the same position separately.
   - It then checks which ship (first or last) has lower durability and simulates the attacks accordingly.
     - If the durability of the left ship is less than or equal to the right ship, it checks if there are enough attacks to sink the left ship completely. If so, it reduces the durability of the right ship and increments the count of sunk ships. If not, it breaks the loop.
     - If the durability of the right ship is less than the left ship, it performs similar checks but for the right ship.
   - The loop continues until either all ships are sunk or there are no more attacks left.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic correctly handles the case where the durability of the left and right ships is the same.
   - The logic also correctly handles the case where one ship is sunk before the next attack, adjusting the pointers accordingly.
   - The logic ensures that once a ship is sunk, it is no longer considered in future attacks.

5. **Output**: The function returns the number of sunk ships, which is printed for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken.

Correctness: **True**
