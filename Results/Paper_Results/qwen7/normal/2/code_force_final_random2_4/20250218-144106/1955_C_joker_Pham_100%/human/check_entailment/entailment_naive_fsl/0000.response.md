Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case when the durability of both the first and last ships is reduced to zero during the same iteration. Let's consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

**Reasoning:**
- In the first iteration, the Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 0, and the array becomes `[0, 2, 4, 3]`.
- In the second iteration, the Kraken attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 0, and the array becomes `[0, 2, 4, 0]`.
- In the third iteration, the Kraken attacks the first ship again, but since its durability is already 0, it does not sink another ship. However, the program incorrectly increments the `sunks` counter again.

This example shows that the program incorrectly counts the number of ships sunk, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
