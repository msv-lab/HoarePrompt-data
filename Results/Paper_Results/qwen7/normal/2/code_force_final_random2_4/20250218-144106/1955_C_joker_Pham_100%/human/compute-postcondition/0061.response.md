Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `l + 1` or `r`, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, `sunks` is equal to `sunks + 2` or remains 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, the value of `a[r]` is less than the value of `a[l]`, and `k` is not equal to twice the value of `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous states, and the additional conditions specified remain unchanged.
