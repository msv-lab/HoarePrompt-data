Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` is either decreased by 1 or remains unchanged, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `r` remains unchanged.
