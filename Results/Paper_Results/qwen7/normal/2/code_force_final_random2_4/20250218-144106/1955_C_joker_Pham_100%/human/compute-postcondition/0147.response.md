Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k - 2 \cdot a_r \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is incremented by either 1 or 2 depending on the condition, `r` is either unchanged or decremented by 1, `sunks` is increased by 1, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= a[r]` subtracts the value of `a[r]` from `a[l]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` are updated according to their respective descriptions. The exact values of `l` and `r` are not specified, but they follow the given conditions. The value of `a[l]` is specifically updated to reflect the subtraction.
