Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\) decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is incremented by 1, `r` remains unchanged, `sunks` is increased by 1, and `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= a[l]` subtracts the value of `a[l]` from `a[r]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
