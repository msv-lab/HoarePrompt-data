Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 0, and the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to the last element of the list `a`.
