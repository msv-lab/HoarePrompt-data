Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `new_median <= median`.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `new_median` and `median`.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `new_median` is equal to `median`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`. Since they are currently equal, we need to change the value of `new_median` to be strictly less than `median` for the loop to proceed.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `new_median` is less than `median` for the loop to execute the first time. Therefore, we need to decrease the value of `new_median` by at least 1.

Given the current state:
- `op` is 0,
- `num` is greater than 0,
- `i` is 0,
- `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000,
- `case` is a string,
- `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits,
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`,
- `median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`,
- `new_median` is equal to `median`,
- `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`. If `num2` is an even number, `ma` is further specified as (`num2` / 2) - 1.

We only need to adjust `new_median` to be less than `median` for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, `new_median` is equal to `median` - 1, and `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`. If `num2` is an even number, `ma` is further specified as (`num2` / 2) - 1.**
