Output State: **`ma` is `num2 // 2`, `case` is an input string, `op` is incremented multiple times, `total` remains 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is greater than `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, with `new_median` being incremented by 1 in each iteration where it is less than or equal to `median` until it becomes greater than `median`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `b` is a sorted version of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `num2 // 2` to `ma`. This does not affect any other variables or their states. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
