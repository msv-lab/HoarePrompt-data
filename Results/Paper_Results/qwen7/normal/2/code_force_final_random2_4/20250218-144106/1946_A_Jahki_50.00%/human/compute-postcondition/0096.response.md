Output State: **`total` is 0, `case` is an input string, `op` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b` and is now greater than `median` + 1, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `b` is a sorted version of list `a`.**

The code `new_median = b[ma]` simply assigns the value of the element at index `ma` in list `b` to the variable `new_median`. This does not change any other variables or their relationships. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `new_median` is now explicitly set to the value of `b[ma]`, which is stated to be greater than `median` + 1.
