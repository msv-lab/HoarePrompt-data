Output State: **`op` is 0, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, `new_median` is assigned the value of `median`**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of the variable `median` to `new_median`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `new_median` is now the same as `median`.
