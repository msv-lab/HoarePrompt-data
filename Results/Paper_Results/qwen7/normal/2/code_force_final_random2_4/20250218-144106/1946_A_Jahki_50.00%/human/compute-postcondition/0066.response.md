Output State: **`op` is incremented by 1, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `op` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `total` stays 0, `a` remains a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers, `b` is still a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is calculated as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, and `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.
