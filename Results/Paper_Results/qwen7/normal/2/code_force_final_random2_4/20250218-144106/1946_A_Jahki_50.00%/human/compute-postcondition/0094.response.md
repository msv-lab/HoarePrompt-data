`op` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `op` before the increment is not specified. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `case` is an input string, `op` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b` and is now greater than `median` + 1, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `b` is a sorted version of list `a`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `case` is an input string, `op` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b` and is now greater than `median` + 1, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `b` is a sorted version of list `a`.**
