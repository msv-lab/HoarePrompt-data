Output State: **`op` is incremented by 1, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. This means `new_median` now holds the value of the element at index `ma` in the list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
