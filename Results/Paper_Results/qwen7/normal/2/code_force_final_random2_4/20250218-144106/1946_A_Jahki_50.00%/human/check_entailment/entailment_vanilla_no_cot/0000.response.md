Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Median Calculation**: The program attempts to increment elements until the median increases, but it does not correctly identify the initial median. Specifically, the program sorts the list `b` after each increment, which is unnecessary and inefficient. Moreover, the logic to find the median is flawed. For an even-sized list, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, but the program only considers one of them.

2. **Unnecessary Sorting**: The program sorts the list `b` in every iteration of the while loop, which is inefficient. This should only be done once to find the initial median.

3. **Break Statement**: The `break` statement inside the loop is not necessary and incorrectly placed. It breaks out of the loop prematurely if the size of the array exceeds 10000, which is not part of the problem constraints.

4. **Logic to Find Initial Median**: The program does not correctly handle the case when the array has an odd number of elements. For an odd-sized array, the median is the middle element, but the program incorrectly handles this case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        case = input()
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split()]
        b = sorted(a)
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            median = (b[num2 // 2 - 1] + b[num2 // 2]) / 2
        else:
            median = b[num2 // 2]
        
        op = 0
        for j in range(num2):
            if a[j] < median:
                diff = median - a[j]
                op += diff
                a[j] += diff
        
        print(int(op))

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version:
- Correctly calculates the initial median.
- Only sorts the list once to find the median.
- Increments elements to make the median increase in the minimum number of operations.
