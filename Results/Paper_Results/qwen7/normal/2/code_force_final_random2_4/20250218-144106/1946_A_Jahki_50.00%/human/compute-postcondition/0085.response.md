Output State: **`case` is an input string, `op` is incremented multiple times, `total` remains 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is greater than `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, and `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, with `new_median` being incremented by 1 in each iteration where it is less than or equal to `median` until it becomes greater than `median`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `a` is a list of integers converted from the digits in `case`.**

Explanation: The code `a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]` creates a new list `a` by converting each digit found in the string `case` into an integer. This does not affect the values of `op`, `total`, `b`, `median`, `ma`, `new_median`, `i`, or `k`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, except for `a` which is now updated to contain the integers from `case` that were digits.
