Output State: **`total` is 0, `case` is an input string, `op` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b` and is now greater than `median` + 1, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `b` is a sorted version of list `a`.**

The code `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b` again, but since `b` was already sorted before this line, sorting it again does not change its state. Therefore, all the variables remain in their previous states.
