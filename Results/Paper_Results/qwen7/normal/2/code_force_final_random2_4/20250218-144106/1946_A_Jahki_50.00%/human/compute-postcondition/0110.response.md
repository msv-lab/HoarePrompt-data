Postcondition: **`case` is an input string, `op` is incremented by 3, `total` remains 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` is `b[ma]` which is now greater than `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, `b[ma]` is incremented by 3, `b` is a sorted version of list `a` and has been sorted twice during the loop iterations, `new_median` is `b[ma]`**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program after the if-else block executes. If `num2 > 10000`, the loop breaks without modifying `op` or `b[ma]`. Otherwise, `op` is incremented by 3, `b[ma]` is incremented by 3, and `new_median` is `b[ma]`, which is now greater than `median`. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
