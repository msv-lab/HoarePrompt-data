Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, `new_median` is equal to `median` - 1, `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`, and `b` is now a sorted version of the original `b` list.**

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b`, which was already sorted. Sorting the same list again does not change its contents. Therefore, the sorted list `b` remains the same as before the sorting operation. All other variables retain their initial states.
