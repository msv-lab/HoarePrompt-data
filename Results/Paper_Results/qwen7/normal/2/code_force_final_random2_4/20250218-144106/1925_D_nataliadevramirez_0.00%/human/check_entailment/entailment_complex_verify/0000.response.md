### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the original assessment and the provided annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness:** False
- **Explanation:** The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program `func_1` does not account for the probability of choosing each pair of friends. Instead, it assumes that each pair will be chosen with equal probability, which is incorrect.

The original assessment is based on the following points:
1. The program incorrectly assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen with equal probability, which is not true.
2. The correct approach should consider the probability of choosing each pair of friends, which is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates the sum of friendship values for all pairs of friends, assuming each pair is chosen with equal probability.
   - The formula used is \( f \times \left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\right) \), which is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of choosing each pair.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic for reading input and calling `func_1` is correct.

#### Correct Approach:
- To correctly calculate the expected value, we need to consider the probability of choosing each pair of friends.
- The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends in one trial is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
- The expected value contribution of each pair of friends \((a, b)\) with friendship value \( f \) is \( f \times \left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\right) \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

The corrected version of the program should use the correct probability calculation.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the program's logic.

**Final: False**
