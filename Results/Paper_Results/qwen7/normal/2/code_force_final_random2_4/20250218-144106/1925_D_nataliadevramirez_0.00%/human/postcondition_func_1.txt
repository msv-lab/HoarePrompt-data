The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves a specified number of children (`n`), pairs of friends (`m`), excursions (`k`), and their friendships represented as a list of lists. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` to compute a result, then prints the cumulative result after processing all test cases. The final output includes the results of all test cases.
