Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is simply `_` (a placeholder variable) and the loop runs `t` times. The only variable directly controlled by the loop is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` must be greater than 1
   - `n` is the first input integer
   - `m` is the second input integer
   - `k` is the third input integer
   - `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs `t` times and `t` must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `t` should be `t - 1`.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `t` must now be greater than 0 (since it was greater than 1 before and we just decremented it by 1).
   - All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

So, the new state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**
