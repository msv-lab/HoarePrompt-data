### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components of the solution and validates the logic implemented in the program. Let's break down the analysis further to ensure the correctness of the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `result` to 0.
   - **Loop Through Friendships**: It iterates through each friendship and adds to `result` the product of the friendship value (`f`) and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`).
   - **Modulo Operation**: The result is returned modulo `MOD` to handle large numbers.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - **Test Case Loop**: For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - **Friendship List Construction**: It constructs the list of friendships.
   - **Function Call and Output**: It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the result.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sum of First `k` Natural Numbers**:
   - The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` natural numbers. This is used to account for the cumulative increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.

2. **Friendship Value Calculation**:
   - Each friendship value `f` is multiplied by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers. This accounts for the fact that each time a friendship pair is chosen, its value increases by 1, and this effect is cumulative over `k` excursions.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Taking the result modulo `10^9 + 7` ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits and avoids overflow issues.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and reads the necessary inputs for each test case. It processes each test case independently, ensuring that the results are computed correctly for each one.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as no friendships (`m = 0`) and small values of `k` correctly.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations provided, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
