Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial conditions for `t`, `friendships`, and `result` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `friendships` remains a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`, which has not been modified by the code.
