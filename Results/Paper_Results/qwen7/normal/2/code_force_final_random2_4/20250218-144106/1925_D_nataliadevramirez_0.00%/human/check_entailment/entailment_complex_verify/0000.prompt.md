You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively. All values are such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), 1 ≤ k ≤ 2*10^5, and 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5. The constant MOD is set to 10^9 + 7.
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        a, b, f = friendships[i]
        
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
        
    #State: Output State: `result` is `m * f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`, `n` is an integer representing the number of children, `m` is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, `k` is an integer representing the number of excursions, `friendships` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `i` is `m`, `a` is not defined since the loop has completed, `b` is not defined since the loop has completed, `f` is not defined since the loop has completed.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `result` accumulates the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for each of the `m` iterations. Therefore, the final value of `result` is `m * f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `f`) retain their post-loop iteration states, which in this case, means `i` would be equal to `m` since the loop has finished executing all `m` iterations.
    return result % MOD
    #The program returns the value of `result` which is `m * f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (number of children), `m` (number of pairs of friends), `k` (number of excursions), and `friendships` (a list of tuples containing friend indices and their values). It calculates and returns the value of `result` which is `m * f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`, where `f` is the friendship value from the `friendships` list and `MOD` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers [a_i, b_i, f_i] representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of times the loop has executed, `n` is the last input integer received, `m` is the last input integer received, `k` is the last input integer received, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers (the last set of friendships entered), `result` is the cumulative return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be the final value it was set to, `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold the values from the last iteration, `friendships` will contain the last set of friendships entered, and `result` will be the combined result of applying `func_1` in each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves a specified number of children (`n`), pairs of friends (`m`), excursions (`k`), and their friendships represented as a list of lists. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` to compute a result, then prints the cumulative result after processing all test cases. The final output includes the results of all test cases.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program `func_1` does not account for the probability of choosing each pair of friends. Instead, it assumes that each pair will be chosen with equal probability, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of choosing each pair of friends. For each pair of friends `(a, b)` with friendship value `f`, the expected value contribution to the sum is `f * (probability of choosing this pair in k trials)`. The probability of choosing a specific pair in one trial is `1 / C(n, 2)`, where `C(n, 2)` is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import comb

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    total_pairs = comb(n, 2)
    result = 0
    for (a, b, f) in friendships:
        prob = 1 / total_pairs
        expected_value = f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) * prob
        result += expected_value
    return int(result % MOD)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This corrected version calculates the expected value correctly by considering the probability of choosing each pair of friends.
