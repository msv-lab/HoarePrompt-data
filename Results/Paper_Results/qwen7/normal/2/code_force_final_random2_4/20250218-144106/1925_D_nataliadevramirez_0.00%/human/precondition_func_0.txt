n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively. All values are such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), 1 ≤ k ≤ 2*10^5, and 1 ≤ f ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5. The constant MOD is set to 10^9 + 7.
