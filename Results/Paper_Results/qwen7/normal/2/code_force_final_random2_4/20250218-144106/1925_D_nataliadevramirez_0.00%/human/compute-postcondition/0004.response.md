Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `friendships` is a list of lists containing integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.

The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. The return value of this function call is assigned to the variable `result`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, the value of `result` is unknown. However, we know that `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` remain unchanged from their initial states.
