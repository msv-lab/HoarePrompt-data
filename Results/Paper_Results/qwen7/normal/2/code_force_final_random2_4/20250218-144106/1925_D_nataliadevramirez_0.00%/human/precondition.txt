n is a positive integer representing the number of children, m is a non-negative integer representing the number of pairs of friends, and k is a positive integer representing the number of excursions. friendships is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (a_i, b_i, f_i) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value, respectively. It is guaranteed that all pairs of friends are distinct, and the friendship value f_i is a positive integer. Additionally, the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
