Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes the `friendships` list by taking `m` lines of input, each line containing two integers separated by spaces, and converting them into a list of lists. Each inner list contains two integers representing pairs of friends. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
