Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The goal is to find \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \), where \( \frac{p}{q} \) is the expected value.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value \( f_i \).
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair in each excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in \( k \) excursions is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - Since the friendship value increases by 1 each time a pair is chosen, the expected increase in friendship value for a specific pair is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

4. **Summing Up All Pairs:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected contribution to the total sum is \( f_i \times k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - Summing up for all pairs of friends, the total expected value is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \times k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]

5. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - The binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
   - Thus, the expected value simplifies to:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \times k \times \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     \frac{k}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i
     \]

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The result needs to be taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Analyzing the Given Program

- **Function `func_1`:**
  ```python
  def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
      result = 0
      for i in range(m):
          (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
          result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
      return result % MOD
  ```
  - This function calculates the sum of friendship values for all pairs of friends, but it does not account for the expected value calculation.
  - The term \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \) is used instead of \( k \times \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \).

- **Function `func_2`:**
  ```python
  def func_2():
      t = int(input())
      for _ in range(t):
          (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
          friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
          result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
          print(result)
  ```
  - This function reads the input and calls `func_1` to compute the result.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation. Specifically, it uses an incorrect formula to compute the expected value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
