Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the next character in the string `a`, `l` is 2, `h` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, so if `j` was 'A' (making `l` equal to 1), now `l` is 2. If `j` was not 'A' (making `h` equal to 1), `h` remains 1. The string `a` and its next character `j` remain unchanged.
