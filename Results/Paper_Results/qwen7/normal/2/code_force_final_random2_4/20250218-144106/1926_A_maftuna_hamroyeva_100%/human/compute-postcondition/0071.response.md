Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the next character in `a`, `l` is 1, `h` is 0 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `h` is the same as before, and `i` is `i + n + 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` becomes 1. The values of `a`, `j`, `h`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `i` is updated to `i + n + 1` (from the previous state) plus 1 due to the increment operation, resulting in `i` being `i + n + 2`.
