Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `char` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `a`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is a list of 7 zeros.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 5\).
   - `a` is a non-empty string of length \(n\) consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
   - `char` is the first character of `a`.
   - `count[ord(char) - ord('A')]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - `char` is set to the current character in the string `a`.
   - `count[ord(char) - ord('A')]` is incremented by 1.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - After the previous iteration, `char` was the first character of `a`.
   - For the next iteration, `char` will be the second character of `a`.
   - Therefore, `count[ord(char) - ord('A')]` will be incremented by 1 for the second character.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `count` will remain the same for the first five elements since only the first character was processed.
   - `char` will be the second character of `a`.
   - `a` remains unchanged.

Given this analysis, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

- `count` is still `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (unchanged).
- `char` is now the second character of `a`.
- `a` remains a non-empty string of length \(n\) consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`count` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `char` is the second character of `a`, `a` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'**
