### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases (`t`), the number of coins (`n`), and the state of the coins (`s`) for each test case.

2. **Counting Facing-Up Coins**:
   - The program counts the number of facing-up coins (`num_up_coins`) using `s.count('U')`.
   - This is a correct way to count the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.

3. **Determining the Winner**:
   - The program checks if the number of facing-up coins is odd (`num_up_coins % 2 == 1`).
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating that Alice will win.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO' to the results list, indicating that Bob will win.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.
   - The output format matches the requirement (case-insensitive).

### Analysis:
- The logic in the program is correct for determining the winner based on the number of facing-up coins.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by reading all input at once and processing each test case sequentially.
- The program's output format is consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
