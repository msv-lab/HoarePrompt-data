You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])

        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is 10, `t` is 3, `n` is the length of `data[8]`, `s` is `data[9]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the count of 'U' in each `s`. If the count of 'U' in any `s` is odd, `results` will contain 'YES' for that iteration; otherwise, it will contain 'NO'. The loop has executed 3 times as specified, and `index` is now at 10, indicating that all iterations of the loop have been completed.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop runs all its iterations, `index` will be 10, `t` will still be 3 (since it's not modified in the loop), `n` will be the length of the 9th element in `data`, `s` will be the 10th element in `data`, and `results` will contain 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the count of 'U' in each string `s` is odd or even during the loop's iterations.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, `index` is 10, `t` is 3, `n` is the length of the 9th element in `data`, `s` is the 10th element in `data`, and `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the count of 'U' in each string `s` is odd or even during the loop's iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases (`t`), the number of coins (`n`), and the state of the coins (`s`) for each test case.

2. **Counting Facing-Up Coins**:
   - The program counts the number of facing-up coins (`num_up_coins`) using `s.count('U')`.
   - This is a correct way to count the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.

3. **Determining the Winner**:
   - The program checks if the number of facing-up coins is odd (`num_up_coins % 2 == 1`).
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating that Alice will win.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO' to the results list, indicating that Bob will win.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.
   - The output format matches the requirement (case-insensitive).

### Analysis:
- The logic in the program is correct for determining the winner based on the number of facing-up coins.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by reading all input at once and processing each test case sequentially.
- The program's output format is consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
