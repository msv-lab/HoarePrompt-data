Output State: **`index` is 7, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is data[5], `s` is data[6], `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' in `s.count('U')`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
