Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer from the list `data`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `data` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
