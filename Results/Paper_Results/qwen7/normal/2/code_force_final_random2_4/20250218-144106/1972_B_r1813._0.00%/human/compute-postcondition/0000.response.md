Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".**

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` function to read from standard input directly. However, this does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, and `s`. Therefore, the initial conditions remain unchanged.
