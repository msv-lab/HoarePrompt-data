Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `index` is 10, `t` is 3, `n` is the length of `data[8]`, `s` is `data[9]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the count of 'U' in each `s`. If the count of 'U' in any `s` is odd, `results` will contain 'YES' for that iteration; otherwise, it will contain 'NO'. The loop has executed 3 times as specified, and `index` is now at 10, indicating that all iterations of the loop have been completed.

In simpler terms, after the loop runs all its iterations, `index` will be 10, `t` will still be 3 (since it's not modified in the loop), `n` will be the length of the 9th element in `data`, `s` will be the 10th element in `data`, and `results` will contain 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the count of 'U' in each string `s` is odd or even during the loop's iterations.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: 

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `result` is the next element in `results`, `results` must have at least one more element

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `result` is the next element in `results`, `results` must have at least two elements




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
