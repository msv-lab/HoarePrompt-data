Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is 0, `k` must be a positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and `k` is still required to be a positive integer. The specific values of `c` and `r` depend on the input provided by the user.
