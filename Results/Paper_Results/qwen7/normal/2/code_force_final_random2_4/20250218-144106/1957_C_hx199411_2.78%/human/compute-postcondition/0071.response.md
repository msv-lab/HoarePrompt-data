Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(k)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `k` is a positive integer (we don't know its exact value, but it is known to be positive).
   - `c` and `r` are input integers (their values are not relevant for adjusting the loop head state).
   - `num` is 4.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < k`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must remain the same since it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`. Given that `i` was 1 and needs to be 2, and `k` remains a positive integer, the new state should reflect these changes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer**.
