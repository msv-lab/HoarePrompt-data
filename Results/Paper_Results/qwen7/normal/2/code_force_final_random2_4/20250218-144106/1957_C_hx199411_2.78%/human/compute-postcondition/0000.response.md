Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and it is set to the integer input received.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing this line of code, `t` will hold the specific integer input within this range. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
