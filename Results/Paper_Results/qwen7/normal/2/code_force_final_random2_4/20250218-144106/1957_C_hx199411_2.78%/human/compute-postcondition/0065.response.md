Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `c` is an input integer.
   - `r` is an input integer.
   - If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1; otherwise, `c` does not equal `r` and `num` is 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < k`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Since `i` is in the range of `k`, the loop can execute again.
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.

5. **Keep the other variables unchanged**: The values of `k`, `c`, `r`, and `num` remain the same unless the loop body changes them, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume these values stay the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and if `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1; otherwise, `c` does not equal `r` and `num` is 2**
