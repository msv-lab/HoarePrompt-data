Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split.**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts using space as a delimiter, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `c` and `r`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.
