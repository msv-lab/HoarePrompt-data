Output State: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 1, `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Since `num` was either 1 or 2, after the operation, `num` will be either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
