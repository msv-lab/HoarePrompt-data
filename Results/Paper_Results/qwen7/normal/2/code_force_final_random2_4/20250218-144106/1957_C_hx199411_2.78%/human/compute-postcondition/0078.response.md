Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `c` and `r` are input integers, `num` is the total number of inputs processed, `m` is `n - num`.**

Explanation: The variable `m` is assigned the value of `n - num`. The values of `i`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states.
