Output State: `t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and `2*k`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `k-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `k-1`. The variable `num` will be the sum of increments based on the conditions inside the loop. Since each iteration either adds `1` or `2` to `num`, and there are `k` iterations, `num` will be an integer value ranging from `k` (if every condition was `c == r`) to `2*k` (if every condition was `c != r`). The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `r`) will retain their states as they were last updated within the loop.
