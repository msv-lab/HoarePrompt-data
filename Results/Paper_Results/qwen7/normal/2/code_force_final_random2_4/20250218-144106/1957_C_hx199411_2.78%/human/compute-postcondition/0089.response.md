Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `c` and `r` are input integers, `num` is the total number of inputs processed, `m` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.**

The code `dp[2] = 3` updates the value of `dp[2]` to 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
