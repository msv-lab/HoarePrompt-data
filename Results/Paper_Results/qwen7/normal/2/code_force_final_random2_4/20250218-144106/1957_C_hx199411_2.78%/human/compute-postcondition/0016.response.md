Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split.**

The value of `num` is incremented by 2, changing its value from the initial state where it was equal to `i` (which was 1) to `i + 2`, making `i` equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
