Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and it is set to the integer input received.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(0)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not, `m` is either 0 or a non-zero integer calculated as `n - num` and must be at least 2, `m` is not equal to 1, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, and `dp[i]` is updated to \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\) for all `i` in the range from 3 to `m`. If `m` is 0, then `i` remains equal to `k`; otherwise, `i` is equal to `k + 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `k + 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `c` and `r` are input integers, `num` is the total number of inputs processed, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` equals 0, then `i` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is set to 6, `k` is a positive integer, `c` and `r` are input integers, `num` is the total number of inputs processed, `m` is greater than 0 and not equal to 1, and `dp` is a list with specific values: `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, `dp[3] = 8`, `dp[4] = 26`, `dp[5] = 114`, and `dp[6] = 514`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and `2*k`, `i` is `m` which is either `n - num` and equals 0, or `m` which is `n - num` and is greater than 5, `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements where each element is an integer, starting from 0 up to `dp[m]`, with `dp[1]` being 1, `dp[2]` being 3, and each subsequent `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 1000000007.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
