Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and if `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 1; otherwise, `c` does not equal `r` and `num` is 2, `c` and `r` are updated to the values inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `c` and `r` respectively. The values of `i`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `num` remains the same based on the comparison between `c` and `r`.
