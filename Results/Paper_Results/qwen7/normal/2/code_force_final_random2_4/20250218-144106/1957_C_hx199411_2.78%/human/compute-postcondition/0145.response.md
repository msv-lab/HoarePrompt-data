Output State: `t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and `2*k`, `i` is `m` (which is now greater than 5 since the loop runs until `i` reaches `m`), `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements where each element is an integer, starting from 0 up to `dp[m]`, with `dp[1]` being 1, `dp[2]` being 3, and each subsequent `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 1000000007`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the `dp` list will contain values computed according to the given recurrence relation, starting from `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`, up to `dp[m]`, where `m` is determined by the initial conditions and must be greater than 5.
