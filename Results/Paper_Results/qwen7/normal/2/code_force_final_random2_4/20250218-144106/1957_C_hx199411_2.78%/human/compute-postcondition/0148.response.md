Postcondition: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and `2*k`, `i` is `m` which is either `n - num` and equals 0, or `m` which is `n - num` and is greater than 5, `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements where each element is an integer, starting from 0 up to `dp[m]`, with `dp[1]` being 1, `dp[2]` being 3, and each subsequent `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 1000000007.**
