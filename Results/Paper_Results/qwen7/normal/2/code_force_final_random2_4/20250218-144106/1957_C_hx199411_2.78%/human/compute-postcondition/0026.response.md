Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split, and `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\). The variable `i` will be equal to the value of `k`, indicating the total number of iterations the loop ran. The variable `num` will contain the cumulative sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration, depending on whether `c` equals `r` or not. Variables `c` and `r` will hold the most recent input integers from the last iteration of the loop.
