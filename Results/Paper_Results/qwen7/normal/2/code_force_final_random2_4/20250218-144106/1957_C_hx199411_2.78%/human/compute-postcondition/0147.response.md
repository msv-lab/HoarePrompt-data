Postcondition: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and `2*k`, `i` is `m` (which is now greater than 5 since the loop runs until `i` reaches `m`), `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements where each element is an integer, starting from 0 up to `dp[m]`, with `dp[1]` being 1, `dp[2]` being 3, and each subsequent `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 1000000007**.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `t` remains False, `n` and `k` retain their original values, `num` is an integer within the specified range, `i` is updated to `m` which is greater than 5, `c` and `r` remain unchanged, `m` is `n - num` and is not equal to 0. Additionally, `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, starting from 0, with specific values for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`, and each subsequent element calculated according to the given recurrence relation.
