Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`, `max_profit` remains equal to `current_profit`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, except for the item just pushed (which is `item`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` is now two items shorter. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, except for the item just pushed (which is `item`), and `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `heap` now contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of `removed_item`, and `item` is the last item popped from `combined`; if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is set to `current_profit`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
