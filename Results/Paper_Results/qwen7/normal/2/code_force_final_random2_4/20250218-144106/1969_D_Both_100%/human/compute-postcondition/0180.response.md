Output State: **`max_profit` remains 0, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, `combined` is an empty list, `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `heap` is an empty heap.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value returned by the function `func_3(combined, heap)` to the variable `current_profit`. Since `combined` is an empty list and `heap` is an empty heap, the exact value of `current_profit` depends on what `func_3` returns. The other variables remain unchanged.
