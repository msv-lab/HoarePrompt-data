Output State: **`max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, `combined` is an empty list, `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `heap` is an empty heap.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` updates the value of `max_profit` to be the same as the current value of `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
