Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `current_profit` is 0, `test_cases` must be a positive integer, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `current_profit` is 0, `test_cases` is a positive integer, `heap` is a list containing one element which is the last element of `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, `k` must be greater than 0, and the list `combined` is not empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `current_profit` is 0, `test_cases` is a positive integer, `heap` is a list containing the last element of `combined` pushed into it, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` must be greater than 1, `max_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `current_profit` remains 0, `test_cases` remains a positive integer, `heap` contains the last element of `combined` (after popping it), `remaining_items` remains an empty list, `neg_prices` remains a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` remains a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` remains the return value of `func_2()`, `k` remains `k-1` and must be greater than 0, `max_profit` remains 0, and `combined` remains a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
