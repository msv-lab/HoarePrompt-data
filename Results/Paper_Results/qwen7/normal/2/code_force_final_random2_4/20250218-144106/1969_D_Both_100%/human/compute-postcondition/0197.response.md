Output State: **`max_profit` remains 0, `current_profit` is either `current_profit - item[1]` or `func_3(combined, heap) + item[0]` depending on whether `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `combined` is now a list with one item less than before (since `item = combined.pop()`), `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `heap` is an updated heap with one item pushed and another popped.**

Explanation: The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` performs two operations:
1. It pops the smallest element from the heap (`heap`).
2. It pushes the new item (`item`) into the heap.

Since the initial state of `heap` is an empty heap, after executing the code, the heap will contain one item, which is the `item` that was pushed. The `combined` list loses one item because `item = combined.pop()`. The `current_profit` and `max_profit` remain unchanged unless the condition inside the function `func_3(combined, heap) + item[0]` is met, but since the exact values are not specified, they retain their initial conditions.
