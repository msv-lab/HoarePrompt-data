Output State: **`current_profit` is reduced by `item[1]`, `max_profit` remains equal to `current_profit`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` is now one item shorter. Additionally, the first item in `combined` satisfies the condition where the sum of its elements is greater than or equal to 0.**

This means that the `current_profit` has been decreased by the value of `item[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
