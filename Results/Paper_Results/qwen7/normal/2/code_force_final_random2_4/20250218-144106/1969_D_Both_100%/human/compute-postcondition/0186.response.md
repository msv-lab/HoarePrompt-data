Postcondition: `max_profit` remains 0, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, `combined` is an empty list, `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `heap` is an empty heap. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.
