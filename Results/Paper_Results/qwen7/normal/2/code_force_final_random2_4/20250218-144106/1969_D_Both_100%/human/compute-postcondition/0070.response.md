Output State: **`item` is the removed_item, `combined` is modified (one element less), `heap` is modified (pushed `item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged unless `current_profit` becomes greater than `max_profit`, in which case `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.**

This means that the `current_profit` has been decreased by the value of `removed_item[0]`. All other variables (`item`, `combined`, `heap`, and `max_profit`) remain in their respective states as described in the initial state, unless `current_profit` surpasses `max_profit`, in which case `max_profit` would be updated accordingly.
