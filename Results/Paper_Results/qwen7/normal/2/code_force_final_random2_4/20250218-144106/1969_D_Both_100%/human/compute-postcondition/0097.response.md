Output State: **`current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` remains 0, `heap` contains the third tuple from `combined` (since the second tuple was popped and pushed into the heap), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code pushes the last element of `combined` (which is the second tuple according to the initial state) into the `heap` using `heapq.heappush`. After this operation, the `heap` now contains the third tuple from `combined` since the second tuple was removed and added back to the heap. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
