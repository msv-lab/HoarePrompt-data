Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, and the values of `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses` are yet to be defined for each test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    heap = []
    remaining_items = []
    n, k = func_2()
    prices = list(func_2())
    neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
    bonuses = list(func_2())
    max_profit = 0
    current_profit = 0
    combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
    combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
    for _ in range(k):
        if combined:
            heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
    if combined:
        current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit
    while combined:
        item = combined.pop()
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            current_profit -= item[1]
        else:
            current_profit += item[0]
        removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
        if removed_item:
            current_profit -= removed_item[0]
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
    print(max_profit)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All items from `combined` have been processed, `heap` is modified accordingly, `current_profit` reflects the final profit calculated after considering all conditions in the loop, and `max_profit` holds the highest profit achieved during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `current_profit` is reduced by the total of all `removed_item[0]` values from each iteration, `max_profit` is the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during any iteration, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus all items popped and pushed back, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` is empty after all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The `current_profit` is adjusted based on all the operations performed within the loop.
- The `max_profit` is the highest profit achieved at any point during the loop's execution.
- The `heap` contains the last item from `combined` after all items have been processed.
- `remaining_items` remains empty as it was initially.
- `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- `combined` becomes empty since all items have been processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` or remains 0 throughout all iterations; `current_profit` is updated based on the conditions within the loop, specifically subtracting `item[1]` when `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` and adding `item[0]` otherwise, and further adjusted by `removed_item[0]` if it exists; `combined` is an empty list once the loop finishes, as each item is popped from it until it is empty; `k` is less than or equal to 0; and `heap` is an updated heap after each iteration where an item is pushed and another popped.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `combined` will be empty, `k` will still be less than or equal to 0, and `heap` will have undergone multiple push and pop operations. The final value of `max_profit` will be the highest `current_profit` encountered during the loop's execution, or it will remain 0 if no profitable combination was found.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
