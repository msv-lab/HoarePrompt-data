Output State: **`item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` is modified (one element less), `heap` is modified (pushed `removed_item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged unless `current_profit` becomes greater than `max_profit`, in which case `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`, and `combined` must still contain at least one element.**

This means that the `current_profit` has been incremented by the value of `item[0]`. All other conditions and relationships between the variables remain the same as the initial state, except for the updated value of `current_profit`.
