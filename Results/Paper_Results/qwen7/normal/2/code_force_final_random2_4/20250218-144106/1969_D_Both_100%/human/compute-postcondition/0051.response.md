Output State: **`item` is the last element of `combined`, `combined` is modified (one element less), `heap` is modified (pushed `removed_item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is updated based on the condition `removed_item[0] + removed_item[1] >= 0`, if true, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[1]`, otherwise increased by `removed_item[0]`, `max_profit` is unchanged if `current_profit` is not greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` is set to the value of `current_profit`.**

This means that after executing the line `item = combined.pop()`, the `item` variable now holds the last element from the `combined` list, which is then removed from `combined`. The `heap` is also updated by pushing the `removed_item` and popping the smallest element. The `current_profit` is adjusted based on the condition specified, and if `current_profit` exceeds `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to the new value of `current_profit`.
