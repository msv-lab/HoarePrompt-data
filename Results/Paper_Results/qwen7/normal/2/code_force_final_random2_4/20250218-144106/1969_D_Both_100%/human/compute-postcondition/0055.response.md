Postcondition: `item` is the last element of `combined` - 1, `combined` is modified (one element less), `heap` is modified (pushed `removed_item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is updated based on the condition `removed_item[0] + removed_item[1] >= 0`, if true, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[1]`, otherwise increased by `item[0]` (if `item` is the last element of `combined` - 1) or `item[1]` (if `item` is the second last element of `combined`), `max_profit` is unchanged if `current_profit` is not greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` is set to the value of `current_profit`.
