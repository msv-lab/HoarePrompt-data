Output State: **`combined` is fully processed, `heap` is an empty list, `current_profit` reflects the final profit, `max_profit` holds the highest profit, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `prices` is a list returned by `func_2(), n` is the return value of `func_2(), and k` is the second return value of `func_2().**

Explanation: The code `prices = list(func_2())` calls the function `func_2()` and assigns its return values to the variables `prices`, `n`, and `k`. The first return value of `func_2()` is assigned to `prices`, converting it into a list. The second and third return values are assigned to `n` and `k`, respectively. The states of the other variables (`combined`, `heap`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, and `remaining_items`) remain unchanged.
