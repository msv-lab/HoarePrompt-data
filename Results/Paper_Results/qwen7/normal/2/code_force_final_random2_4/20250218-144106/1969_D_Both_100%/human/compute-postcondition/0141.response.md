Output State: **`current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, `item` is the last item popped from `combined`, and `remaining_items` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `item = combined.pop()` pops the last item from the `combined` list and assigns it to the variable `item`. This means `combined` now contains all its elements except the last one. The other variables (`current_profit`, `heap`, and `remaining_items`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
