The function accepts two parameters: `primary_items`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, and `secondary_heap`, a list of tuples where each tuple also contains two integers. It calculates the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `secondary_heap`. Additionally, for each tuple `item` in `primary_items`, if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, it adds `item[0] + item[1]` to the total sum; otherwise, it does not add anything. The function returns the final calculated total.
