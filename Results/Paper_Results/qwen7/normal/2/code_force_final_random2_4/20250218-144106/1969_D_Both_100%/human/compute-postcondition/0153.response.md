Output State: `current_profit` is reduced by the total of all `removed_item[0]` values from each iteration, `max_profit` is the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during any iteration, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus all items popped and pushed back, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` is empty after all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The `current_profit` is adjusted based on all the operations performed within the loop.
- The `max_profit` is the highest profit achieved at any point during the loop's execution.
- The `heap` contains the last item from `combined` after all items have been processed.
- `remaining_items` remains empty as it was initially.
- `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- `combined` becomes empty since all items have been processed.
