Postcondition: **`current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` remains 0, `heap` contains the first tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

This postcondition summarizes that if the `combined` list is not empty, the first tuple from `combined` is moved to `heap`, and all other variables remain unchanged as per the precondition. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition's outcome.
