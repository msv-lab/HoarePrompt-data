You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n. prices is a list of n integers where 1 <= price_i <= 10^9, and bonuses is a list of n integers where 1 <= bonus_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_4():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        heap = []
        
        remaining_items = []
        
        n, k = func_2()
        
        prices = list(func_2())
        
        neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
        
        bonuses = list(func_2())

        combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
        
        for _ in range(k):
            if combined:
                heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
        
        if combined:
            current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
        
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
        
        while combined:
            item = combined.pop()
            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]
            removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
            if removed_item:
                current_profit -= removed_item[0]
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        
        print(max_profit)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `combined` will be an empty list, `k` will be less than or equal to 0, and `heap` will contain the last item from `combined` after all items have been processed. `current_profit` will reflect the final profit calculated after all conditions in the loop were considered, and `max_profit` will hold the highest profit achieved during the entire loop execution. The `remaining_items` list will remain empty, `neg_prices` will be a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` will be the return value of `func_2()`, and `bonuses` will be a list returned by `func_2()`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
    #- `combined` is empty because all items have been processed.
    #- `k` is non-positive (less than or equal to 0) because it is decremented with each iteration and starts at a positive value.
    #- `heap` contains the last item from `combined` after all processing.
    #- `current_profit` is the final profit calculated after all operations within the loop.
    #- `max_profit` is the highest profit achieved during the loop's execution.
    #- `remaining_items` is empty as it was initially.
    #- `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    #- `heap` is updated after each iteration with push and pop operations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a non-negative integer), `prices` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive), and `bonuses` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns different values based on the conditions specified for each test case.
