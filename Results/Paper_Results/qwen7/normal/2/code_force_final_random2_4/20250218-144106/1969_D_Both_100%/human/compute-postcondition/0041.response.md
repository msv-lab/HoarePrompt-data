Postcondition: **`current_profit` is updated based on the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`; if true, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`, otherwise increased by `item[0]`; `heap` is modified by pushing `item` and popping the smallest element; `combined` remains a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, with the last item popped. The value of `removed_item` is true.**
