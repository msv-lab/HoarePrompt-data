Output State: **`current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and an element from `bonuses`, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code `combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))` creates a list of tuples where each tuple consists of one element from `neg_prices` paired with one element from `bonuses`. The values of `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged.
