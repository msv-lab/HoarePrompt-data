Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and `s` is the input string received from the input mechanism. If the length of the set of characters in `s` is 1 and the length of `s` is greater than 1, then `s` consists of the same character repeated multiple times. Otherwise, if `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is a string obtained by moving the first character of `s` to the end of `s`. Otherwise, `s2` remains unchanged.
