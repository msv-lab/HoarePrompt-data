Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- There are two strings `s` and `s2`.
- If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated by one character to the left.
- If `s` is not equal to `s2`, the condition remains unchanged, meaning `s2` is still a random permutation of the string `s`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. The values of `t`, `s`, and `s2` do not affect this particular print statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

Output: **Yes**
