Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string. If the length of the set of characters in `s` is 1 and the length of `s` is greater than 1, then the postcondition remains unchanged, meaning `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and `s` is a string. Otherwise, if `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated by one character to the left. If `s` is not equal to `s2`, then `s2` is still a random permutation of the string `s`.
