Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s` is the input string received from the input mechanism, and if the length of the unique characters in `s` is 1 and the length of `s` is greater than 1, then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is a string obtained by moving the first character of `s` to the end of `s`.
