Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `s2` is a string obtained by moving the first character of `s` to the end of `s`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` takes the string `s` and creates a new string `s2` by taking all characters of `s` except the first one (`s[1:]`) and appending the first character of `s` (`s[0]`) to the end. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation.
