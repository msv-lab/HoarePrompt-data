Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains as 1, `T` remains as the initial positive integer, `info` remains as the list of strings split from the input, `a` remains as the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` remains as the second element of `info` converted to an integer, `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `t` and `T` will stay the same as their initial values. The `info` list will also remain unchanged. The variable `a` and `b` will retain their values as the first and second elements of the `info` list, respectively. The variable `suma` will be the cumulative sum of all `x` values that were calculated during the loop, but only when the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` was satisfied for each iteration.
