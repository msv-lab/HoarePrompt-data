Output State: **`x` is equal to (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1.**

This means that the variable `x` has been assigned the value `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. The values of `a` and `i` from the initial state are used in this calculation. No other variables have been affected by this line of code.
