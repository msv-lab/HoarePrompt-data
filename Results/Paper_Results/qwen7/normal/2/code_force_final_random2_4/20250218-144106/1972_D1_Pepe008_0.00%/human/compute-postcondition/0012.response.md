Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is given as:
     - If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `x` remains unchanged and `suma` is equal to `x`.
     - If `a - i * (i - 1) <= 0`, then no change occurs.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - The value of `b` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `b` remains the same.
   - The values of `x` and `suma` depend on the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`. However, since we don't know the exact values of `a` and `b`, we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `suma` for the next iteration without knowing the specific values of `a` and `b`.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the unchanged value of `b`.

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b` is `b`**.
