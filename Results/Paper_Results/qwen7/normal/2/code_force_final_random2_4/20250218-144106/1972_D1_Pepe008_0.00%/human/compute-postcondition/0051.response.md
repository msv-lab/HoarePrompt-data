Output State: **`t` is 2, `T` remains as the initial positive integer, `info` is a list of strings split from the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer, `suma` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `suma` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `suma` or any other variables, the values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
