Output State: **`x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**

Explanation: The given code assigns the value of the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` to the variable `x`. Since the initial values of `a` and `i` are not specified, `x` is updated to this specific expression. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
