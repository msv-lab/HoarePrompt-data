Output State: **`t` is 2, `T` remains as the initial positive integer, `info` is a list of strings split from the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer, and the values of `a` and `b` are specific integers derived from the elements of `info`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged at 2, `T` retains its initial positive integer value, and `info` is still a list of strings split from the input. The variables `a` and `b` are now specific integers, being the first and second elements of `info` respectively, converted to integers.
