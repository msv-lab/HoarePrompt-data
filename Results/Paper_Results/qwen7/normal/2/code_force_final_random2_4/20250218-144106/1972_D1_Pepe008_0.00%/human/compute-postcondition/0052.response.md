Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function arguments `1` and `b + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to `1` (as specified in the range function).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b + 1`. Therefore, `i` must be within this range.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - `i` should be set to `1` at the start of the loop.
   - `b` should be such that `i` can reach up to `b + 1` during the loop execution.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is 2
- `T` remains as the initial positive integer
- `info` is a list of strings split from the input
- `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer
- `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer
- `suma` is 0

We need to adjust the states of `i` and `b` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State after adjustment**:
- `i` should be `1`.
- `b` should be a positive integer such that `i` can reach up to `b + 1` during the loop execution.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`i` is 1, `b` must be a positive integer**
