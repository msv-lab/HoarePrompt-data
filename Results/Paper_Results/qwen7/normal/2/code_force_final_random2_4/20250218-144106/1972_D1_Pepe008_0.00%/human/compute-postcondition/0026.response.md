Output State: **`t` is 1, `T` remains as the initial positive integer, `info` is a list of strings split from the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])` takes the first and second elements of the list `info` and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to the variables `a` and `b`, respectively. The other variables (`t`, `T`, and `suma`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
