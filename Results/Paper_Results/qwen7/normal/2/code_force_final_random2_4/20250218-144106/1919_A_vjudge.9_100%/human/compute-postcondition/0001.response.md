Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged and are still positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, the loop will execute if and only if `t` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: Since the loop depends on `t` being greater than or equal to 1, we need to ensure this condition is met. The values of `a` and `b` do not affect the loop's execution and can remain unchanged.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` and `i`. Specifically, `t` must be at least 1, and `i` should start from 0 (the default value for `range(t)`).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
