Output State: `t` must be at least 3, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `a` and `b` are input integers assigned the values of two integers input by the user separated by a space during the last iteration. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the loop prints 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, the loop prints 'Alice'. The values of `a` and `b` do not change within the loop.
