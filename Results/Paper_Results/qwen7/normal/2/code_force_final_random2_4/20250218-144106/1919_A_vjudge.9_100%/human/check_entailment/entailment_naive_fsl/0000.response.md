Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic. According to the problem description, the winner is determined based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets after all moves. However, the program incorrectly checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd to determine the winner. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the optimal strategy of both players.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `Bob`

According to the game rules, if both Alice and Bob play optimally, the game will end in a situation where one of them cannot make a move. Let's walk through the game:

1. Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with 1 coin.
2. Alice can either swap wallets or remove a coin. If she removes a coin, she will have 0 coins, and Bob will still have 1 coin.
3. Bob now has 1 coin and Alice has 0 coins.
4. Bob can either swap wallets or remove a coin. If he removes a coin, he will have 0 coins, and Alice will still have 0 coins.
5. Both players now have 0 coins, and neither can make a move.

Since both players play optimally, the game ends in a draw, but the program incorrectly prints "Bob" as the winner.

Another example to further demonstrate the issue:

- Input: `2 1`
- Expected Output: `Alice`

Following the optimal strategy:
1. Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
2. Alice can either swap wallets or remove a coin. If she removes a coin, she will have 1 coin, and Bob will still have 1 coin.
3. Bob now has 1 coin and Alice has 1 coin.
4. Bob can either swap wallets or remove a coin. If he removes a coin, he will have 0 coins, and Alice will still have 1 coin.
5. Alice now has 1 coin and Bob has 0 coins.
6. Alice can either swap wallets or remove a coin. If she removes a coin, she will have 0 coins, and Bob will still have 0 coins.
7. Both players now have 0 coins, and neither can make a move.

Again, the game ends in a draw, but the program incorrectly prints "Alice" as the winner.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and fails to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
