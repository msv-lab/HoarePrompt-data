Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` remains unchanged. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` remains unchanged.
