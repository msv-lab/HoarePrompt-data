Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The game involves optimal play from both players.
2. The provided solution checks whether the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`abs(a - b)`) is even or odd. If it is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
3. This logic is based on the observation that if the absolute difference is even, Bob can always force the game into a state where the difference remains even after each move, ensuring he can always make a valid move until Alice is forced to lose. Conversely, if the difference is odd, Alice can force the game into a state where the difference becomes even, allowing her to eventually win.
4. The provided annotated program correctly implements this logic by iterating through each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b`, and printing the appropriate winner based on the parity of the absolute difference.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
