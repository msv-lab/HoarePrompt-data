Output State: **`D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged if `D[out_aa] > 0` and `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 3, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `fnd` is set to 0 if `D[out_aa] <= 0`, `C[in_aa]` is still greater than 0.**

This means that the value of `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0 and `E[out_aa]` was also greater than 0 before the increment, `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0 but `E[out_aa]` was less than or equal to 0, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 3. If `D[out_aa]` was less than or equal to 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `fnd` is set to 0. The condition that `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0 remains unchanged.
