Postcondition: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than or equal to -6, `E[out_aa]` remains unchanged and is less than or equal to 0, `m` is incremented by 1, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` else 0, `n` remains unchanged, `in_aa` and `out_aa` remain unchanged, `aa` remains unchanged, `bb` remains unchanged, `cnt_aa` remains unchanged, `cnt_bb` remains unchanged, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D` plus 1, `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0, otherwise `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 and is now greater than 1, `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1 and is now at least -1.**
