Postcondition: **`D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `m` is an integer and `m` is increased by 1; `k` is an integer; `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; all other variables retain their original values.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If `E[out_aa] > 0`, then `m` is incremented by 1 and `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `D` is updated to reflect one less occurrence of `out_aa`, `E` is updated accordingly, and `fnd` is increased by 1 under the same condition, while all other variables remain unchanged.
