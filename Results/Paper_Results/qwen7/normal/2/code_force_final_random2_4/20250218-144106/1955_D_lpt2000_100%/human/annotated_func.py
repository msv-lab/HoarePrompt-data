#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

    #State: The final state after the loop executes all its iterations will be as follows:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers). For each test case, it calculates the number of valid pairs (fnd) based on specific conditions involving the counts of elements in lists a and b. The function returns the total count of valid pairs found across all test cases.
