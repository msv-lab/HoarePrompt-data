Output State: **`nabors` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `nabors` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `nabors = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `nabors`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the code only changes the name of the variable to `nabors`, the constraint on the value of `nabors` remains the same. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected by this line of code, so they retain their initial state.
