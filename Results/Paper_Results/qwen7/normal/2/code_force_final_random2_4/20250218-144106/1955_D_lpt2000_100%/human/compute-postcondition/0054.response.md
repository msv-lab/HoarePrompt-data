Postcondition: **`D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `m` is incremented by 1; `k` is an integer; `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` (the sum of the values in `D` + 1 if `C[in_aa]` was positive, or just the sum of the values in `D` if `C[in_aa]` was not positive) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `out_aa`'s count in `D` is decreased by 1 if `D[out_aa] > 0` and `C[in_aa]` was positive, otherwise `out_aa`'s count in `E` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was positive; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was not positive; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`.**
