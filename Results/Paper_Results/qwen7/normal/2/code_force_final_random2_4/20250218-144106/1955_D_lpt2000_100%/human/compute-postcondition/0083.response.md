Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than or equal to -2, `E[out_aa]` remains unchanged and is less than or equal to 0, `m` remains unchanged, `fnd` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `in_aa` remains unchanged, `out_aa` remains unchanged, `aa` remains unchanged, `bb` remains unchanged, `cnt_aa` remains unchanged, `cnt_bb` remains unchanged, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1. Since `D[out_aa]` is initially decreased by 1 and is now greater than or equal to -1, after decrementing `pairs_in_D` by 1, `D[out_aa]` will be decreased by another 1, making it greater than or equal to -2. All other variables remain unchanged.
