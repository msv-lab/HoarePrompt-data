Output State: **`cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `aa` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `bb` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in the list `bb`**.

The code `cnt_bb = Counter(bb)` creates a new Counter object `cnt_bb` that contains the count of each element in the list `bb`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
