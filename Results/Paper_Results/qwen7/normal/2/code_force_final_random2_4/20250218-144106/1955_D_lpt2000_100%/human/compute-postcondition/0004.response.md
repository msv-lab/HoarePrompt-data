Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `aa` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `bb` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string**.

Explanation: The code `bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]` takes an input string, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns this list to `bb`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, and `nabors` remain unchanged from their initial states.
