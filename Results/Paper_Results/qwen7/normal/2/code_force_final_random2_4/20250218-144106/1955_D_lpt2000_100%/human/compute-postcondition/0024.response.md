Postcondition: **`D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `n` is an integer such that `n > m`; `m` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `aa` is a list of strings with length at least `n`; `nabors` is an integer such that `1 <= nabors <= 10^4`; `bb` is a list of strings; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in the list `bb`; `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`; if `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 2, `fnd` is set to 0, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; if `D[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `fnd` is set to 0.**
