Postcondition: `D[out_aa]` is greater than or equal to -7, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `m` is incremented by 1, `fnd` is updated based on the condition involving `pairs_in_D`, `n` remains unchanged, `in_aa` is the next element in the slice `aa[m+1:]`, `out_aa` is the corresponding element in the slice `aa[:n - (m + 1)]`, and either:
- If `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was originally greater than 0, or
- If `C[in_aa]` was not greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and is now less than or equal to 0, and `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged.
