Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 1`, `fnd` is 0 since `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `D[out_aa] -= 1` decrements the value of `D[out_aa]` by 1. Since `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing it remains positive but is reduced by 1. The values of other variables (`E`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `nabors`, `bb`, `cnt_bb`, `C`, `pairs_in_D`, `fnd`) remain unchanged.
