Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b` // 2 or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is the first word from input, `b` is the second word from input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = input().split()` takes two inputs separated by a space and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t1`, `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
