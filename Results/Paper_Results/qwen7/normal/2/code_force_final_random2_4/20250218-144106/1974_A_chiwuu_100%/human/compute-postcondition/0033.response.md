Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b` // 2 or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is an integer value of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(b)` converts the value of `b` to an integer. Since `b` was previously a variable that could hold any value, now it specifically holds an integer value. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
