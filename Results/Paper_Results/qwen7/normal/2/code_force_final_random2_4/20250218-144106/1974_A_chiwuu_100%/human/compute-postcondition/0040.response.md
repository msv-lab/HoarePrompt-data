The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. It simply reassigns `t` to its current value. The other variables (`t1`, `n`, `i`, and `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `t % 2` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `b` is an integer value of `b`.**
