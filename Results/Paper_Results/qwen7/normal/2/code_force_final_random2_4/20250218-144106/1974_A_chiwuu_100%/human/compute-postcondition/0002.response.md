Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string**

Explanation: The code `a, b = input().split()` takes a single line of input and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `a` and the second part to `b`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, these conditions remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are strings resulting from the split operation.
