### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - It initializes `t` with the value of `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `b` is odd, it increments `t` by 1 to ensure enough space for all 2x2 icons. This is because a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and if `b` is odd, one extra screen might be needed.
   - `t` is then adjusted to account for the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons: `t = t * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Checking Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - `t1` calculates the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), then the current `t` is sufficient.
   - Otherwise, it calculates how many additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons: `t2 = a - t1`.
   - `t` is updated to include these additional screens:
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t += t2 // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `t += t2 // 15 + 1`.

4. **Outputting Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the value of `t`, which represents the minimum number of screens needed.

#### Testing with Provided Examples

Let's verify the logic with some example inputs:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 1` (since there is 1 2x2 icon)
     - `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1` (since 1 is odd)
     - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
     - `t1 >= 1` is true, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `7 2`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 2` (since there are 2 2x2 icons)
     - `t = 2 // 2 + 1 = 2` (since 2 is even)
     - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 22`
     - `t1 >= 7` is true, so `t = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `12 4`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 4` (since there are 4 2x2 icons)
     - `t = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3` (since 4 is even)
     - `t1 = 3 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 31`
     - `t1 >= 12` is true, so `t = 3`
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `0 3`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 3` (since there are 3 2x2 icons)
     - `t = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2` (since 3 is odd)
     - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`
     - `t1 >= 0` is true, so `t = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `1 0`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 0` (since there are no 2x2 icons)
     - `t = 0 // 2 + 1 = 1` (since 0 is even)
     - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 15`
     - `t1 >= 1` is true, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `8 1`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 1` (since there is 1 2x2 icon)
     - `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1` (since 1 is odd)
     - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
     - `t1 >= 8` is true, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `0 0`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 0` (since there are no icons)
     - `t = 0 // 2 + 1 = 1` (since 0 is even)
     - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 15`
     - `t1 >= 0` is true, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `0` (Correct, since no screens are needed)

8. **Test Case 8:**
   - Input: `2 0`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 0` (since there are no 2x2 icons)
     - `t = 0 // 2 + 1 = 1` (since 0 is even)
     - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 15`
     - `t1 >= 2` is false, so `t2 = 2 - 15 = -13` (which means we need 2 more screens)
     - `t += -13 // 15 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

9. **Test Case 9:**
   - Input: `15 0`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 0` (since there are no 2x2 icons)
     - `t = 0 // 2 + 1 = 1` (since 0 is even)
     - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 15`
     - `t1 >= 15` is true, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

10. **Test Case 10:**
    - Input: `8 2`
    - Calculation:
      - `t = 2` (since there are 2 2x2 icons)
      - `t = 2 // 2 + 1 = 2` (since 2 is even)
      - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 22`
      - `t1 >= 8` is true, so `t = 2`
    - Output: `2` (Correct)

11. **Test Case 11:**
    - Input: `0 9`
    - Calculation:
      - `t = 9` (since there are 9 2x2 icons)
      - `t = 9 // 2 + 1 = 5` (since 9 is odd)
      - `t1 = 5 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 45`
      - `t1 >= 0` is true, so `t = 5`
    - Output: `5` (Correct)
