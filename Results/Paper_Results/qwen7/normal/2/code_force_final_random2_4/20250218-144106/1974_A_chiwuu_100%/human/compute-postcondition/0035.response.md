Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is equal to `b / 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is an integer value of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `t = t // 2` updates the value of `t` to be `t` divided by 2 using integer division. The other variables (`t1`, `n`, `i`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
