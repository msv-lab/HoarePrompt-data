Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b
    if t % 2 == 0:
        t = t // 2
    else:
        t = t // 2 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b` // 2 or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer, and `t` is updated as follows: if `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged; otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1` where `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`; otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `t % 2` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is an integer value of `b`, and if `t1 >= a`, then `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 == 0)`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is now equal to `b`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is now an integer value of the original `b`, `a` is an integer value from user input, and if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, or `t + (t2 // 15)` otherwise, where `t2 = a - t1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
