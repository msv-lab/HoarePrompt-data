Output State: **`t2` is `a - t1`, `t` is now equal to `b`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is now an integer value of the original `b`, `a` is converted to an integer from the user input `a`, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to its current value plus the integer division of `t2` by 15, plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
