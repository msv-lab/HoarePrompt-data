Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is now equal to `b`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is now an integer value of the original `b`, `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` to `t // 2 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` initially, `t` is set to the value of `b`, `n` is still greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` remains an integer, and the new value of `t` is `b // 2 + 1`.
