Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the `func` function aligns with the requirements of the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the code step-by-step:

### Problem Requirements:
- We need to place icons on screens where each screen is a 5x3 grid.
- Icons can be either 1x1 or 2x2.
- Each cell can hold at most one icon.
- We need to minimize the number of screens used.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Icon Placement Calculation**:
   - `t = b`: This initializes `t` with the number of 2x2 icons.
   - If `t % 2 == 0`, `t = t // 2`. Otherwise, `t = t // 2 + 1`.
     - This step seems to be calculating how many full 2x2 grids (each taking 4 cells) can fit into the available space.
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - `if t1 >= a`: If the remaining space is enough to fit all 1x1 icons, no additional screens are needed beyond the current count of `t`.
   - `else`: If not, calculate the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - `t2 = a - t1`: Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that still need placement.
     - `if t2 % 15 == 0`: If the remaining icons perfectly fill another 5x3 screen, add `t2 // 15` to `t`.
     - `else`: If there are leftover icons, add `t2 // 15 + 1` to `t`.

### Verification:
- The logic seems to correctly handle the placement of 2x2 icons first, then the 1x1 icons.
- The calculation of the remaining space and subsequent placement of 1x1 icons appears to be accurate.
- The final value of `t` should indeed reflect the minimum number of screens needed.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
