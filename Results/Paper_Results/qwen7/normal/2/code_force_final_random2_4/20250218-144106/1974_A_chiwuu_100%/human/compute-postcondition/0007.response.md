Output State: **`t` is now equal to `b` // 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer**.

The value of `t` is halved using integer division (`//`), making it equal to `b` divided by 2. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being greater than or equal to 1 and `a` remaining an integer.
