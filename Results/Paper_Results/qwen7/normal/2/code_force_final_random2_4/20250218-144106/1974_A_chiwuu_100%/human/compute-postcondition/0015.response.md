Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b` // 2 or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer, and `t` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. It simply reassigns `t` to its current value, which means `t` remains either `b // 2` or `1`. All other variables (`t1`, `n`, `a`) remain in their initial conditions as specified in the initial state.
