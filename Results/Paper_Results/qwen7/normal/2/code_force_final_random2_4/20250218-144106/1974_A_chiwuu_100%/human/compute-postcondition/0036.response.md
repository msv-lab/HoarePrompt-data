Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is an integer value of `b`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` by performing integer division by 2 and adding 1. The other variables (`t1`, `n`, `i`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
