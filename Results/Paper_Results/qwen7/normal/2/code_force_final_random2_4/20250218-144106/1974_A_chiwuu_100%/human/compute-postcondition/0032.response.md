Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b` // 2 or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(a)` converts the first word from input, which was originally a string, into an integer. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
