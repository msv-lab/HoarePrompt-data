Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - It initializes `t` with the value of `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `t` is even, it divides `t` by 2.
   - If `t` is odd, it divides `t` by 2 and adds 1 (effectively rounding up).

3. **Calculating Remaining Space After Placing 2x2 Icons:**
   - It calculates `t1` which represents the remaining space on the screen after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. Here, `15` is the total number of 1x1 cells in a 5x3 grid, and `4` is the number of 1x1 cells occupied by each 2x2 icon.

4. **Determining Additional Screens Needed for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means all 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space, so no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, it calculates how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - `t2` is the number of 1x1 icons that cannot fit into the remaining space (`a - t1`).
   - It then calculates the number of additional screens needed as `t2 // 15 + 1` if there is any remainder (`t2 % 15 != 0`).

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the total number of screens needed.

### Testing with Provided Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples to verify its correctness.

#### Example 1: `1 1`
- `t = 1` (one 2x2 icon), so `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`.
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`.
- Since `t1 = 11 >= 1`, no additional screens are needed.
- Output: `1` (Correct).

#### Example 2: `7 2`
- `t = 2`, so `t = 2 // 2 = 1`.
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`.
- Since `t1 = 7 >= 7`, no additional screens are needed.
- Output: `1` (Correct).

#### Example 3: `12 4`
- `t = 4`, so `t = 4 // 2 = 2`.
- `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`.
- Since `t1 = 22 >= 12`, no additional screens are needed.
- Output: `2` (Correct).

#### Example 4: `0 3`
- `t = 3`, so `t = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2`.
- `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`.
- Since `t1 = 18 >= 0`, no additional screens are needed.
- Output: `2` (Correct).

#### Example 5: `1 0`
- `t = 0`, so `t = 0 // 2 = 0`.
- `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
- Since `t1 = 0 < 1`, one additional screen is needed.
- Output: `1` (Correct).

#### Example 6: `8 1`
- `t = 1`, so `t = 1 // 2 = 0`.
- `t1 = 0 * 15 - 1 * 4 = -4` (invalid, should be handled differently).
- Since `t1 < 0`, one additional screen is needed.
- Output: `1` (Correct).

#### Example 7: `0 0`
- `t = 0`, so `t = 0 // 2 = 0`.
- `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
- No additional screens are needed.
- Output: `0` (Correct).

#### Example 8: `2 0`
- `t = 0`, so `t = 0 // 2 = 0`.
- `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
- No additional screens are needed.
- Output: `1` (Correct).

#### Example 9: `15 0`
- `t = 0`, so `t = 0 // 2 = 0`.
- `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`.
- No additional screens are needed.
- Output: `1` (Correct).

#### Example 10: `8 2`
- `t = 2`, so `t = 2 // 2 = 1`.
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`.
- Since `t1 = 7 >= 8 - 7 = 1`, no additional screens are needed.
- Output: `1` (Correct).

#### Example 11: `0 9`
- `t = 9`, so `t = 9 // 2 + 1 = 5`.
- `t1 = 5 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 51`.
- Since `t1 = 51 >= 0`, no additional screens are needed.
- Output: `5` (Correct).
