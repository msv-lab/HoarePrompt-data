The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( T \), \( n \), and \( x \). For each test case, it reads a list of \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \), sorts this list, and then counts the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list. If the gap between the last element and \( n \) is also 1, this is counted as well. The function returns the total count of such gaps plus \( x - 2 \) for each test case.
