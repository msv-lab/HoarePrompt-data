Output State: **`i` is -1, `num` is 1, `count` is 1**.

The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Given that `count` was initially the sum of all increments made during the loop, and since no prior increments are mentioned, `count` starts at 0. After executing the code, `count` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `num` remain unchanged.
