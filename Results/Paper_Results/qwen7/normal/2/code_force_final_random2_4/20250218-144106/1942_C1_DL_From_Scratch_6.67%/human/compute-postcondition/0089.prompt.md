Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4. All other variables are not affected.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    list0 = sorted(list0)
    count = 0
    for i in range(x - 1):
        num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
    num = n - list0[-1]
    if num == 1:
        count += 1
    print(count + x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `count` is equal to `x`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `y` is an integer input from the user, `list0` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, and if `num` equals 1, then `count` is incremented to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is -1, `num` is 1, and `count` is 1. If `num` equals 1, then `count` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `x - 2`, `num` is equal to 1, and `count` is equal to 2. If the condition `num == 1` is true, then these values are maintained. If the condition is false, there is no change to the values of `i`, `num`, and `count`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
