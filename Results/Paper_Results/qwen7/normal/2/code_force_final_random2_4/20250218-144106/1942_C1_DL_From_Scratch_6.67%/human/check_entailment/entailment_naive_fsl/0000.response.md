Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to count the number of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices, but this approach does not guarantee the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```

- Expected Output:
```
2
```

- Actual Output:
```
1
```

The program counts the number of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices, but it fails to consider the possibility of forming triangles using the remaining vertices in a way that maximizes the number of triangles. For example, in the given test case, the vertices 1, 6, 2, and 5 can form at most 2 non-intersecting triangles, but the program incorrectly outputs 1.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that we can form as many non-intersecting triangles as possible. This involves considering all possible ways to connect the chosen vertices and the remaining vertices to maximize the number of triangles. The current implementation does not account for this complexity.
