Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices. The solution should focus on forming triangles rather than just counting gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.

2. **Logic Error**: The current logic counts the number of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and adds one for the remaining part of the polygon. This approach does not ensure that the maximum number of triangles are formed.

3. **Correct Approach**: To maximize the number of triangles, we need to use the chosen vertices and additional vertices (if any) to form as many triangles as possible. Since `y = 0` in this version, no additional vertices can be chosen, so we need to work with the existing `x` chosen vertices.

4. **Correct Solution**: Given `x` chosen vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`. This is because any set of 3 vertices can form a triangle, and we need at least 3 vertices to form a triangle. Therefore, the formula `x - 2` directly gives the answer.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # The maximum number of triangles that can be formed is x - 2
        print(x - 2)
```

This solution correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be given out.
