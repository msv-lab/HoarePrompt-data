Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 2 and between 1 and 500, `i` is 3, `s` must be a string with more than one character, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 1, the current value of `s[j]` is '1', the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1'. If the condition `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'` is true, then `flag` is set to True and `j` is incremented to 1. If the condition is false, the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `count`, and `j` remain unchanged.
