State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains two variables: `i` and `t`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid integer within the specified range (1 to 500).
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
4. Therefore, the initial state should reflect these conditions.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, and `i` is set to 0.
