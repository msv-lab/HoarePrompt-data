Output State: **`low` is such that `low + 2 <= high` or `low` is such that `low <= high - 2`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the return value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`**.

This means that the variable `profit_mid` has been assigned the return value from the function `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, while the values of `low` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The condition for `low` and `high` also remains valid.
