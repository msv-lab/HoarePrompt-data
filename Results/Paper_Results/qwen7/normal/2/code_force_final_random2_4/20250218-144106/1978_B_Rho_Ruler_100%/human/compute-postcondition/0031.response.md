Output State: `low` is the final lower bound where the maximum profit is found, `high` is the final upper bound which is either `low` or one step above it, `max_profit` is the highest profit found during the iterations, `mid` is the last midpoint calculated, and `profit_next` is the profit calculated at `mid + 1`.

In this final state, the algorithm has iteratively narrowed down the range `[low, high]` to find the optimal `mid` that maximizes the profit as determined by the function `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. The variable `max_profit` holds the highest profit encountered throughout these iterations. The values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` reflect the last comparison made within the loop, with `low` being the best lower bound and `high` being the corresponding upper bound.
