Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `mid`; `mid` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2; `high` is now `mid` - 1; `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`; `profit_mid` remains unchanged; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The code `high = mid - 1` updates the value of `high` to be `mid - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
