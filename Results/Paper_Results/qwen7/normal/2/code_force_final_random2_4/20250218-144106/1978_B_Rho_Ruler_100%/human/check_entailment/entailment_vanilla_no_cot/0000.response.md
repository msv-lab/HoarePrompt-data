Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules. 

- `func_1` calculates the profit for a given `k` value using the formula \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \), which accounts for the modified price for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining buns.
- `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal `k` value that maximizes the profit. It iteratively narrows down the range of possible `k` values and uses `func_1` to compute the profit for the midpoint and the next value to decide whether to move the lower or upper bound of the search range.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach is efficient and correct. The binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found within the specified range, and the profit calculation function accurately reflects the promotion rules.
