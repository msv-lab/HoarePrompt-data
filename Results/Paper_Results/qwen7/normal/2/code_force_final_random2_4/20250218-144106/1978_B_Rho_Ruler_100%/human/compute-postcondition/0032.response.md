Output State: **The program returns the highest profit (`max_profit`) found during the iterations, with `low` being the final lower bound and `high` being the final upper bound which is either `low` or one step above it.**

This means that the program has iteratively narrowed down the range `[low, high]` to find the optimal `mid` that maximizes the profit as determined by the function `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. The variable `max_profit` holds the highest profit encountered throughout these iterations, and the values of `low` and `high` reflect the last comparison made within the loop.
