### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling `n` buns.
   - For the first `k` buns, the price is `b - i + 1` where `i` is the index of the bun (1-indexed).
   - For the remaining `(n - k)` buns, the price is `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - It uses the formula: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
     - `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the total revenue from the first `k` buns with the modified prices.
     - `(n - k) * a` calculates the total revenue from the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
   - It iteratively checks the profit for the middle value `mid` and the next value `mid + 1`.
   - If `profit_next` (for `mid + 1`) is greater than `profit_mid`, it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`.

4. **Binary Search Analysis:**
   - The function correctly uses binary search to find the optimal `k`.
   - The profit calculation in `func_1` is accurate and matches the problem statement.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as `k = 0` and `k = min(n, b)` correctly.
   - The binary search approach is appropriate for large values of `n` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit using binary search and the profit calculation function. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
