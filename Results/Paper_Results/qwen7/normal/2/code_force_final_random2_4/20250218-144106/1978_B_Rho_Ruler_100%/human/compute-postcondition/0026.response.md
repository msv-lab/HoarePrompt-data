Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `mid`, `mid` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `high` is greater than or equal to `mid`, `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `profit_mid` remains unchanged, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The code updates `max_profit` to be the maximum value between its current value and `profit_mid`. The values of `low`, `mid`, `high`, `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` remain as they were before the code was executed, except that `max_profit` is now updated to reflect the maximum of its original value and `profit_mid`.
