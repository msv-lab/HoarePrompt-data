Output State: **`low` is such that `low + 2 <= high` or `low` is such that `low <= high - 2`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` between `low` and `high` using integer division. The condition for `low` remains unchanged, meaning `low` is still such that `low + 2 <= high` or `low` is such that `low <= high - 2`. The new value of `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.
