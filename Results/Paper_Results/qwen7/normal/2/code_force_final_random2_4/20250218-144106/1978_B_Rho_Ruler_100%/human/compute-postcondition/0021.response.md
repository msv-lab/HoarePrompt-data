Postcondition: **`low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` retain their initial states or are updated according to the if-else conditions. If `profit_next > profit_mid`, then `low` becomes `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` becomes `mid - 1`. In both cases, `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are the return values of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)` respectively, and `max_profit` is the maximum value between `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.**
