### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description:
- Bob has \( n \) buns.
- The usual price of a bun is \( a \) coins.
- Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (where \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b) \)).
- The first \( k \) buns are sold at prices \( b, (b-1), (b-2), \ldots, (b-k+1) \).
- The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns.

#### Function Summaries:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Input: \( k \), \( n \), \( a \), \( b \).
   - Output: Computes the profit for selling the first \( k \) buns at modified prices and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - Formula: \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Input: \( n \), \( a \), \( b \).
   - Output: Uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes profit.
   - Binary search range: \( [0, \min(n, b)] \).
   - Returns the maximum profit found and the final bounds of the search range.

#### Analysis:
1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search in `func_2` aims to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), `func_1` is called to compute the profit for selling the first \( mid \) buns at the modified prices and the remaining \( n - mid \) buns at the usual price.
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is greater than the profit for \( mid \), the search range is adjusted to the right; otherwise, it is adjusted to the left.
   - This ensures that the search converges to the optimal \( k \).

2. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The formula used in `func_1` correctly accounts for the modified prices and the usual price.
   - The term \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \) represents the total revenue from the first \( k \) buns sold at the modified prices.
   - The term \( (n - k) \cdot a \) represents the total revenue from the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( k = 0 \), all buns are sold at the usual price \( a \), which is handled correctly.
   - When \( k = \min(n, b) \), all buns are sold at the modified prices, which is also handled correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules. The binary search approach ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found efficiently.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules.
