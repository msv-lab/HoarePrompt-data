Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `mid` - 1, `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `mid` is (0 + (`mid` - 1)) // 2, `profit_next` is the return value of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, and `profit_next` is less than or equal to `profit_mid`.**

Explanation: The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions. The new value of `high` is expressed in terms of the previously defined `mid`.
