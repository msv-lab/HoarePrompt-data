Output State: **`low` is such that `low + 2 <= high` or `low` is such that `low <= high - 2`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the return value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)'; `profit_next` is the return value of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)'; `max_profit` is the maximum value between `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)` updates the value of `max_profit` to be the maximum of its current value and `profit_mid`. The values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` remain unchanged from their initial states.
