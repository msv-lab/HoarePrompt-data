Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves finding the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling buns under a specific promotional pricing scheme.
2. **Key Components**:
   - **Promotion Strategy**: Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (where \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b) \)) to sell the first \( k \) buns at a modified price, and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - **Profit Calculation**: The profit for selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified prices is \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \). The profit for selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \) is \( (n - k) \times a \).
   - **Optimization**: The goal is to find the value of \( k \) that maximizes the total profit.
3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - **Binary Search**: The code uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) and returns the maximum profit.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( k = 0 \), all buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - When \( k = n \), all buns are sold at the modified price starting from \( b \).

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit using binary search. The binary search ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found efficiently, and the profit calculation function is correctly implemented.

Correctness: **True**
