Output State: **`low` is `mid` + 1, `high` is at least 0, `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `profit_mid` is now equal to `profit_next`, `mid` is updated to (mid + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The line `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. All other variables (`high`, `max_profit`, `mid`, `profit_next`, and `profit_mid`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
