Postcondition: **`low`, `high`, `max_profit`, `mid`, and `profit_next` are updated accordingly. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` becomes `mid` + 1, `profit_mid` is updated to `profit_next`, and `mid` is updated to (mid + 1) // 2. Otherwise, `high` becomes `mid` - 1, and `profit_mid` remains unchanged.**
