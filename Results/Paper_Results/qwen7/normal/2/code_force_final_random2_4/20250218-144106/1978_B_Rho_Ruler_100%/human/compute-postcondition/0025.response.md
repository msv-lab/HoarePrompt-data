Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `mid`, `mid` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `high` is greater than or equal to `mid`, `profit_mid` remains unchanged, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `profit_next` as the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. The values of `low`, `mid`, and `high` remain unchanged from their previous states. `profit_mid` also remains unchanged because it was not affected by the new calculation.
