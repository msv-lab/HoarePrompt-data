### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling `n` buns.
   - For the first `k` buns, the price is `b - i + 1` where `i` is the index of the bun (1-indexed).
   - For the remaining `(n - k)` buns, the price is `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - It uses the formula: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
     - `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the total revenue from the first `k` buns with the modified prices.
     - `(n - k) * a` calculates the total revenue from the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
   - It iteratively checks the profit for the middle value `mid` and the next value `mid + 1`.
   - If `profit_next` (for `mid + 1`) is greater than `profit_mid`, it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`.

4. **Binary Search Analysis:**
   - The function correctly uses binary search to find the optimal `k`.
   - The profit calculation in `func_1` is accurate and matches the problem statement.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as `k = 0` and `k = min(n, b)` correctly.
   - The binary search approach is appropriate for large values of `n` and `b`.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is read from input, indicating the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read from input.
  - `func_2(n, a, b)` is called and the result is printed.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.
  - This formula accurately reflects the revenue from selling the first `k` buns at modified prices and the remaining buns at the usual price.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - `low` is initialized to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
  - The binary search loop runs until `low` exceeds `high`.
  - Inside the loop, `mid` is calculated as the midpoint between `low` and `high`.
  - `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` calculates the profit for `mid` buns at the modified price.
  - `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)` calculates the profit for `mid + 1` buns at the modified price.
  - The maximum profit is updated if the profit for `mid + 1` is higher.
  - `low` and `high` are updated based on the comparison of profits.

- **Final State:**
  - The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`.
  - The maximum profit found during the iterations is returned.

### Validation of Original Assessment:

- **Correctness of Profit Calculation:**
  - The formula used in `func_1` is correct and matches the problem statement.
  - The binary search approach in `func_2` is efficient and correctly finds the optimal `k`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases such as `k = 0` and `k = min(n, b)` correctly.
  - The binary search approach is appropriate for large values of `n` and `b`.

- **Overall Logic:**
  - The overall logic of the program is sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit using binary search and the profit calculation function. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final:
