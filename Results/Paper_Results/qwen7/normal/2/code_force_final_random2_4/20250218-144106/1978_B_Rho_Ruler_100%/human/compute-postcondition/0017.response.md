Output State: **`low` is such that `low + 2 <= high` or `low` is such that `low <= high - 2`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the return value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the return value of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `profit_next` by calling the function `func_1` with arguments `mid + 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. The values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `profit_mid` remain unchanged from their initial state.
