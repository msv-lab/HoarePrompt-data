Output: **No**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `s` is an input string from the user, and `s2` is a random permutation of the string `s`. The `print('No')` statement simply prints the string 'No'. Since no other information about the content of `s` or `s2` is provided, and the print statement does not reference these variables, the output will be the literal string 'No'.
