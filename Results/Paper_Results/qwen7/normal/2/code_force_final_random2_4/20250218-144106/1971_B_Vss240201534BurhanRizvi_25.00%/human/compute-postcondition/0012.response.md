Output State: **`s` is an input string from the user, `s2` is a random permutation of the string `s`**.

Explanation: The code `s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))` generates a random permutation of the string `s` and assigns it to `s2`. The original string `s` remains unchanged, and `s2` now holds the permuted version of `s`.
