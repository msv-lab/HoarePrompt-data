Reasoning:

1. The problem requires generating a new string \( r \) from the input string \( s \) that is different from \( s \), or determining if it's impossible to do so.
2. The provided solution uses the `random.sample()` function to generate a random permutation of the input string \( s \).
3. The logic checks if the generated permutation \( s2 \) is different from the original string \( s \):
   - If \( s \neq s2 \), it prints 'Yes' followed by \( s2 \).
   - If \( s == s2 \), it prints 'No'.
4. Given that `random.sample()` generates a random permutation of the input string, there is a non-zero probability that \( s \) will be different from \( s2 \) unless \( s \) consists of identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa").
5. For strings consisting of identical characters, the permutation will always be the same as the original string, leading to 'No' being printed.
6. The solution correctly handles all test cases as per the examples provided.

Therefore, the given program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
