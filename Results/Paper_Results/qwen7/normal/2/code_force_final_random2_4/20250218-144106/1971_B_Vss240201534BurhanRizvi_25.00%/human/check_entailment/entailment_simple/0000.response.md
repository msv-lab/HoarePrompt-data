Reasoning:

1. The problem requires rearranging the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`. If no such rearrangement is possible (e.g., when `s` consists of duplicate characters), the program should output "NO".
2. The provided program uses `random.sample` to generate a random permutation of the input string `s` and checks if this permutation is different from the original string.
3. The logic of generating a random permutation and checking if it is different from the original string is sound and should work correctly for strings of length up to 10.
4. The program handles multiple test cases as specified, reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each test case individually.
5. The program outputs "YES" followed by the new string `s2` if `s` is different from `s2`, and "NO" otherwise.
6. The program ensures that `s2` is a random permutation of `s` and thus not equal to `s` unless `s` has duplicate characters where all characters are the same (e.g., "aaaaa").

Given these points, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
