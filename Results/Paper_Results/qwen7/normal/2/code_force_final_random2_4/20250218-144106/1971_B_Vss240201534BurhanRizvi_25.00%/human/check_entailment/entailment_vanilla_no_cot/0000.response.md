Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly attempts to generate a new string `s2` by randomly rearranging the characters of the input string `s`. If the generated string `s2` is different from the original string `s`, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`. If `s` and `s2` are the same (which would happen if the string consists of duplicate characters), it prints "No". This approach works for the given constraints and examples, and the program handles the specified conditions appropriately.
