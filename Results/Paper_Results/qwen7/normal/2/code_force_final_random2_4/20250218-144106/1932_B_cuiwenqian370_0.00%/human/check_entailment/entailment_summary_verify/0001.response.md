Reasoning:
1. The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not match the problem description. The problem requires calculating the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur based on their periodicity, whereas the provided code seems to be solving a different problem involving dynamic programming or string processing.
2. The function `func_1` is indeed irrelevant to the problem. It processes a list `path` using characters `@` and `*`, which are not mentioned in the problem statement. This function is not designed to calculate the year when all signs will occur.
3. The function `func_2` attempts to read input from stdin, process multiple test cases, and call `func_1` with each test case. Since `func_1` is not correctly implemented for the problem, `func_2` also fails to produce the correct output.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem.

Final: **False**
