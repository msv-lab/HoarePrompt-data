Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `index` is increased by 16, `path` is the value of `data[index]`, `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`**.

In this case, the code `results.append(func_1(path))` appends the return value of `func_1(path)` to the `results` list. The values of `t`, `index`, `path`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states. The only change is that `results` now contains an additional element, which is the return value of `func_1(path)`.
