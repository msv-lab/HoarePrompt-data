Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is the length of `path`, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is either `1` or `-inf` depending on the first character of `path`, and the second element is `dp[0] + 1` if the second character of `path` is `@`, otherwise `dp[1]` remains the same as `dp[0]`. If the third character of `path` is '*', `dp[2]` is `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[2]` is the maximum of `dp[1]` and `dp[0]` plus 1 if the third character of `path` is `@`, otherwise it remains the same as the maximum of `dp[1]` and `dp[0]`.
