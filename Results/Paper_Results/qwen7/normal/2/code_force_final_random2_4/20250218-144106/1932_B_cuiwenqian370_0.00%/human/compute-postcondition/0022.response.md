Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `index` is increased by 34, `path` is now `data[index]`, `results` is a list with an additional element which is the return value of `func_1(data[index])`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `n` is an integer**

Explanation: The code appends the return value of `func_1(path)` to the `results` list. Since `path` is equal to `data[index]`, `results` now contains the return value of `func_1(data[index])`. The other variables (`t`, `index`, `path`, `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
