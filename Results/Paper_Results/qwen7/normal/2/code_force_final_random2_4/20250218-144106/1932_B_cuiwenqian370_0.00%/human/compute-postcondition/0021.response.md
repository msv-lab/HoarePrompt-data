Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `index` is increased by 34, `path` is now `data[index]`, `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(data[index])`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `n` is an integer**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was increased by 33, so now it has been increased by 34. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
