Output State: **`t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `index` is 1**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `index`. The initial values of `t` and `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still the first element of `data` converted to an integer, and `data` is still a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by spaces. The only change is that `index` is now `1`.
