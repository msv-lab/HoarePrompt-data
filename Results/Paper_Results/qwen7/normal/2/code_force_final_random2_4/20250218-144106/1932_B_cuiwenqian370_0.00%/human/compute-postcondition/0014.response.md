Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `index` is increased by 8, `path` is the value of `data[index]`, `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to the variable `path`. This does not change the values of `t`, `index`, `results`, or `n`. The only change is that `path` now holds the value of `data[index]`. Since `index` was previously increased by 4, it is now increased by 8. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
