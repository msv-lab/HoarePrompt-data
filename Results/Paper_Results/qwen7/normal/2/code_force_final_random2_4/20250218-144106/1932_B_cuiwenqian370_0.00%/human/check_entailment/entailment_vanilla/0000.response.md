Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not match the problem description at all. The problem involves calculating the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur based on their periodicity. However, the code provided is trying to solve a different problem, likely related to dynamic programming or string processing.
2. The function `func_1` takes a list `path` as input, which seems to be unrelated to the problem's requirements. It uses characters like `@` and `*` and calculates some kind of dynamic programming solution, but this is not relevant to the given problem.
3. The function `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` with each test case. Again, this function is not solving the problem correctly because `func_1` is not designed to handle the problem's requirements.

Given that the provided functions do not implement the logic required to solve the given problem, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
