Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not match the problem description at all. The problem involves calculating the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur based on their periodicities. However, the given functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not perform any calculation related to this problem.
2. `func_1` is designed to handle a string of '@' and '*' characters and calculate a dynamic programming array based on these characters, which is completely unrelated to the problem of finding the year when all signs will occur.
3. `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` on each test case but again, `func_1` is not performing the required calculation for the problem.

Given that the provided functions do not implement the logic needed to solve the problem, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
