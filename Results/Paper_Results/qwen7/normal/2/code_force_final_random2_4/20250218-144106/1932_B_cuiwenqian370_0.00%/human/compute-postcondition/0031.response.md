Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (number of signs), and a string `path` containing space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where for each test case, it receives the number of test cases (`t`), the number of signs (`n`), and a string of space-separated integers (`path`) indicating the periodicities of those signs.
