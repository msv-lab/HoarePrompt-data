You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where '@' represents a valid sign and '*' represents an invalid sign or a gap that cannot contribute to forming a valid sequence of signs.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `n` is not equal to 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if (path[0] == '@') :
        dp[0] = 1
    else :
        if (path[0] == '*') :
            dp[0] = -float('inf')
        #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the first character of `path` is '*', the first element of `dp` is `-inf`. Otherwise, the first element of `dp` remains `0`.
    #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the first character of `path` is '@', the first element of `dp` is `1`. If the first character of `path` is '*', the first element of `dp` is `-inf`. Otherwise, the first element of `dp` remains `0`.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is either `1` or `-inf` depending on the first character of `path`, and the second element of `dp` is `dp[0] + 1` if the second character of `path` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is `dp[0]`.
    #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` elements. The first element of `dp` is either `1` or `-inf` depending on the first character of `path`. The second element of `dp` is `dp[0] + 1` if the second character of `path` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is `dp[0]`.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `dp[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1` will be updated according to the rules specified in the loop body. Specifically, `dp[i]` will be `-float('inf')` if `path[i]` is '*', and otherwise, `dp[i]` will be the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@', or simply the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` if `path[i]` is any other character. The final state of `dp` will reflect these updates for all characters in `path`.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value among the elements in `dp` that are not equal to `-float('inf')`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `path` and returns either 0 or the maximum value among the elements in `dp` that are not equal to `-float('inf')`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value among the elements in `dp` that are not equal to `-float('inf')`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
