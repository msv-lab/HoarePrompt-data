Based on the initial state, `results` must have at least two elements. However, since no specific values or further details about the elements in the `results` list are provided, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed for `result`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the first element of the `results` list, but we do not know its value.

Output: **result (where result is the first element of the `results` list)**
