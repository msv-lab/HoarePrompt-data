Output State: **`results` must have exactly three elements.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will contain exactly three elements. This is because the loop is designed to append return values of `func_1(data[index])` to the `results` list during each iteration, and since the loop runs for the number of elements in `results` (which starts at 3 and increases by 1 each time), it will run exactly three times. Therefore, `results` will end up with three elements after all iterations are complete.
