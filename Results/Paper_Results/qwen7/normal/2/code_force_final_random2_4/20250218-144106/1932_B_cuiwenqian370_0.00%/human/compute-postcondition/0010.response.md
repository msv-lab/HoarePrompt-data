Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `index` is increased by 2; `path` is the value of `data[index]`; `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation: The code appends the return value of `func_1(path)` to the `results` list. The values of `t`, `index`, and `path` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information is that `results` now contains the return value of `func_1(path)`.
