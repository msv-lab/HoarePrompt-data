You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:

        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 1001, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'.
    #
    #After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `i` will be 1001 because the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, starting from 1. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be randomly generated integers between 1 and 9 for the last iteration of the loop, and the value of `res` will be determined based on the conditions provided in the loop body for the last set of `x`, `y`, and `z` values.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine whether three given digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a stair, a peak, or neither based on specific conditions.
2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a `while` loop that runs indefinitely (`i <= 1000`) and generates random numbers for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) within the range [1, 9].
   - It checks the conditions for a peak and a stair but does not match the input format specified in the problem statement.
   - The program prints random values and their corresponding results, which do not correspond to the input test cases provided.
   - The program does not read any input from the user; it generates random numbers internally.
   - The program does not handle the number of test cases (`t`) or the actual input values as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The program should read the number of test cases and then process each test case by reading three digits.
   - For each set of three digits, it should check the conditions for a stair or a peak and print the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. It generates random numbers and prints them without processing the actual input as required.
