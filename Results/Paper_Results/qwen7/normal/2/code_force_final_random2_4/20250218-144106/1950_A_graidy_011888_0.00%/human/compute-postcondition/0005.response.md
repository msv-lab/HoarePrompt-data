Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `res` is an empty string.**

The code initializes an empty string `res`. Since no operations are performed on `i`, `x`, `y`, or `z`, their values remain unchanged. The output state includes the updated value of `res`.
