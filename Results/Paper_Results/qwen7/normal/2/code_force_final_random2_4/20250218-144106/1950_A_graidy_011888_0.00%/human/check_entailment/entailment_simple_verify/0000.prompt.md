You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

            else:

        else:

        i += 1



- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'

        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 1001, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'.
    #
    #After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `i` will be 1001 because the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, starting from 1. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be randomly generated integers between 1 and 9 for the last iteration of the loop, and the value of `res` will be determined based on the conditions provided in the loop body for the last set of `x`, `y`, and `z` values.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak. Specifically, the program generates random digits and prints them along with a result, but it does not actually solve the problem as described. The logic inside the `func` function is not checking the input values against the conditions for a stair or a peak. Instead, it generates random values and makes a decision based on those random values, which is irrelevant to the problem at hand. Therefore, this program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
