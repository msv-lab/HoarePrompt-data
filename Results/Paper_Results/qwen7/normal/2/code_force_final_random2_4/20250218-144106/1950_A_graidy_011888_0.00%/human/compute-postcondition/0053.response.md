Postcondition: **`i` must be less than or equal to 1000, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `res` is either 'peak' or 'stair' or 'none'. If `y` is greater than `z`, then `res` is 'peak'. Otherwise, if `y` is less than `z`, then `res` is 'stair'. If neither condition is met, `res` is 'none'.**
