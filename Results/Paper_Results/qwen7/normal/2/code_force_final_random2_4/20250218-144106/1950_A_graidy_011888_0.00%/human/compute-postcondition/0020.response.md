Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'none'` to the variable `res`. Since the initial value of `res` was an empty string (`''`), it now holds the string `'none'`. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and the condition `x >= y` remain unchanged.
