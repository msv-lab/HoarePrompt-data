Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none'**.

The code `res = 'none'` assigns the string `'none'` to the variable `res`. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
