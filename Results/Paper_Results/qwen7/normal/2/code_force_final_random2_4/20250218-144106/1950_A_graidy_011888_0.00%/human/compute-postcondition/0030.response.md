Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `res` is an empty string.**

The code `res = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `res`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `x`, `y`, and `z`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
