Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'. Specifically, if `y` is greater than `z`, then `res` is set to 'peak'. If `y` is less than `z`, then `res` is set to 'stair'. If neither condition is met, `res` is set to 'none'. Additionally, if the condition `x < y` is false, `res` is set to 'none' and `x` remains greater than or equal to `y`.
