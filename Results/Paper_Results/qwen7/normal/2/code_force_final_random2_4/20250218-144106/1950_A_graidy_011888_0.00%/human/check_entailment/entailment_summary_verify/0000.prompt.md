You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function generates 1000 sets of three random integers (x, y, z) each ranging from 1 to 9. For each set, it determines whether the relationship between x, y, and z forms a 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' pattern based on specific conditions. It then prints each set of integers followed by the determined pattern. After completing 1000 iterations, the function does not return any value but outputs the results of all iterations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak. Specifically, the program generates random digits and prints them along with a result, but it does not actually solve the problem as described. The logic inside the `func` function is not checking the input values against the conditions for a stair or a peak. Instead, it generates random values and makes a decision based on those random values, which is irrelevant to the problem at hand. Therefore, this program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
