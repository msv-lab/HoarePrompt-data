The function accepts two parameters, n and k, both of which are positive integers between 1 and 10^18. It checks if n equals k, in which case it prints "YES" followed by 1 twice and returns n (or k). If n is less than k, it prints "NO" and returns None. If n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to reduce n to k using specific costs and prints "NO" if the total operations are less than k, otherwise it prints "YES", 2, "YES", and the list of costs. The function ultimately returns n (or k) if it prints "YES" or None if it prints "NO".
