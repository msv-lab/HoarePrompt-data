### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Initial Input Handling:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
       func_1(n, k)
   ```
   - This part reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n, k):
       if n == k:
           print('YES')
           print(1)
           print(1)
           return
       if n < k:
           print('NO')
           return
       costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
       h = 0
       for i in costs:
           curr = n // i
           h += curr
           n -= i * curr
       if h < k:
           print('NO')
       else:
           print(2)
           print('YES')
           print(*costs)
   ```

   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price `1`, ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n < k`, the program prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels with fewer coins.
   - Otherwise, the program sets up 2 stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` and checks if the total number of jewels Alice buys equals `k`.

3. **Detailed Execution:**
   - The program calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall and accumulates the total.
   - If the total number of jewels Alice buys is less than `k`, the program prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls (`2`), followed by the prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

#### Annotated Code Explanation:

- **State Before Function Call:** `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- **Case 1: `n == k`:**
  - Prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price `1`.
- **Case 2: `n < k`:**
  - Prints "NO".
- **Case 3: `n >= k`:**
  - Sets up 2 stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
  - Checks if the total number of jewels Alice buys equals `k`.
  - If not, prints "NO".
  - Otherwise, prints "YES", 2, and the prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:

1. **Case 1: `n == k`:**
   - The program correctly handles this case by printing "YES" and setting up 1 stall with price `1`.
   - This ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Case 2: `n < k`:**
   - The program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels with fewer coins.

3. **Case 3: `n >= k`:**
   - The program sets up 2 stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - Let's verify this:
     - At the first stall, Alice buys \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor\) jewels.
     - At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel.
     - Total jewels bought = \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor + 1\).

   - If \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor + 1 = k\), the program prints "YES" and the prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

   - Consider the example `n = 255`, `k = 8`:
     - Prices are `[247, 1]`.
     - At the first stall, Alice buys \(\left\lfloor \frac{255}{247} \right\rfloor = 1\) jewel.
     - At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel.
     - Total jewels = \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is incorrect.

   - The program fails to handle this specific case correctly.

#### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic to determine the prices and the number of stalls is flawed, as demonstrated by the example `n = 255`, `k = 8`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
