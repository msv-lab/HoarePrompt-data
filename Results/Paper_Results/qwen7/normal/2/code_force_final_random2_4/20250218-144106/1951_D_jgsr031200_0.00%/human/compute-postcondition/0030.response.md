Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`.
     - This means `costs` is a list with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `h` is equal to `n - (n - k + 1)`.
     - Simplifying this, `h = n - (n - k + 1) = n - n + k - 1 = k - 1`.
   - `n` is reduced to `k - 1`.
     - This means the value of `n` is now `k - 1`.
   - `h` is equal to `k - 1`.
     - This is already established from the previous step.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given these steps, the print statement will simply output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
