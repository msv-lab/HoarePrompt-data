Output State: `costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is equal to `n - (n - k + 1)`, `n` is reduced to `k - 1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `n` is reduced by the sum of all elements in the `costs` list, which is `n - k + 1 + 1 = n - k + 2`. Since `h` is incremented by `curr` in each iteration and `curr` is always equal to `n // i`, which in the last iteration would be `1` (as `n` becomes `k - 1`), `h` will be incremented `n - k + 1` times plus one more time when `n` is `k - 1`, making it equal to `n`. However, since `n` is reduced to `k - 1` by the end of the loop, `h` will be `n - (n - k + 1)`, simplifying to `k - 1`.
