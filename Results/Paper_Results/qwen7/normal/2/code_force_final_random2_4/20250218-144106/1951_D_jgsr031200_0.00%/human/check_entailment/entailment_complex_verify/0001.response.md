### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from each stall in sequence.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (coins Alice has) and `k` (jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - It then calls `func_1(n, k)`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", `1`, and `1`. This means Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if she has exactly `k` coins.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This means Alice cannot buy even one jewel if she has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy with the given `n` coins and checks if the sum of these jewels is less than `k`.
     - It initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
     - It calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy with each cost and updates `h` (total jewels bought) and `n` (remaining coins).
     - If the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the calculated `costs`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling `n == k` and `n < k` is correct.
   - The logic for calculating the number of jewels Alice can buy with the given costs and checking if the total is at least `k` is also correct.
   - However, the function `func_1` only considers up to 2 stalls. The problem states that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, but the current implementation only handles up to 2 stalls. This is a significant limitation and does not cover all possible scenarios where more than 2 stalls might be needed.

5. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the first test case (7 3), the program correctly outputs "YES" and the appropriate values.
   - For the second test case (6 4), the program incorrectly outputs "YES" when it should output "NO".
   - For the third test case (255 8), the program correctly outputs "YES" and the appropriate values.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code provides a detailed step-by-step execution of the function `func_1`. It correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
   - The annotated code confirms that the function does not handle cases where more than 2 stalls are needed, which is a critical oversight.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where more than 2 stalls are needed to achieve exactly `k` jewels. The program fails to meet the requirement of setting up at most 60 stalls.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
