Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `costs`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `h` is increased by `2n`.
   - `n` is decreased by `i * curr`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `curr` is `n`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `costs` list.
   - The loop variable `i` takes the values from the `costs` list.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 (the first element of the list), the next value of `i` would be the second element of the list, which is `1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be set to `1` again for the next iteration.
   - The list `costs` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `costs` remains the same: a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `i` is reset to `1` for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `i` is 1**.
