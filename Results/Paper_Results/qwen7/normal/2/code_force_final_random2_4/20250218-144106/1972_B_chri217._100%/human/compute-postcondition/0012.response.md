Output State: **`cases` is a list containing two tuples (n, s), `n` is an integer read from standard input and stripped, `s` is the string read from standard input and stripped.**

Explanation: The code reads a string from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `s`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was already read from standard input in the initial state. The list `cases` contains two tuples, each consisting of `n` and `s`.
