The function accepts a list `case` where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`. If the count of "U" is even, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
