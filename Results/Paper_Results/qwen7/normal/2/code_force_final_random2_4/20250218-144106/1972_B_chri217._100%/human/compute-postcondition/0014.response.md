Output State: `cases` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`. Here, `n` represents an integer input read from standard input, and `s` represents the next line of input from standard input with leading and trailing whitespace removed. The list contains `t` such tuples, with each tuple corresponding to the inputs read during each iteration of the loop.
