Functionality: **The function reads `t` pairs of inputs from standard input, where each pair consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`. It processes these inputs, removing any leading or trailing whitespace from the string `s`, and stores them as tuples. Finally, it returns a list containing `t` such tuples.**
