Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of coins (facing up or down) and the rules provided.
2. The solution is divided into two functions:
   - `func_1`: Reads the input and prepares the test cases.
   - `func_2`: Determines the winner based on the number of coins facing up.
3. `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases, the number of coins, and the configuration of the coins for each test case. It stores this information in a list of tuples and returns it.
4. `func_2` correctly counts the number of coins facing up ("U") and determines the winner based on whether this count is even or odd. According to the problem statement, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
5. The logic in `func_2` aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements and the provided examples.
6. The overall structure of the program ensures that it processes each test case correctly and outputs the appropriate result.

Given that both functions work as intended and the logic matches the problem description, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
