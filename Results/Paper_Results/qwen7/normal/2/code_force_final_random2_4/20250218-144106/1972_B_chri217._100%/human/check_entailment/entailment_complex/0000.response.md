Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the orientations of the coins.
   - It stores these inputs as tuples in a list called `cases`.
   - The function returns `cases`, which is a list of tuples, each containing the number of coins `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a single test case from the list returned by `func_1`.
   - It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
   - If the count of 'U' is even, it returns 'YES', indicating that Alice will win.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, it returns 'NO', indicating that Bob will win.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates over each test case and calls `func_2` for each case.
   - The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case.
   - The logic in `func_2` is based on the observation that if the number of facing-up coins ('U') is even, Alice can always force a win by playing optimally. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Bob can force a win.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The problem statement specifies that the game ends in a finite number of operations and one of the players will win.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The implementation of reading inputs and processing them is also correct.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
