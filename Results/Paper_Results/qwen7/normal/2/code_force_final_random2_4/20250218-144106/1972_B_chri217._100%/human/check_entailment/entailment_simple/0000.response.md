### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly reads the input for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the orientation of the coins. It then stores these values in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `(n, s)`.
   - The state of the program before calling `func_2()` is a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the number of coins facing up (`ups`). It then determines the winner based on whether this count is even or odd.
   - If the count of 'U' (coins facing up) is even, the function returns `'YES'`, indicating that Alice wins. Otherwise, it returns `'NO'`, indicating that Bob wins.
   - The logic aligns with the problem statement, which states that the player who faces up an even number of coins wins.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly iterates over each test case, calls `func_2()` for each case, and prints the result.
   - Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in `func_2()`, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
