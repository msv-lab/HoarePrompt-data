Output State: **`cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t - 1` and `s` is the first line of input from stdin with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still equal to `t - 1`. The list `cases` contains a single tuple with the original values of `n` and `s`.
