Output State: **Both is a set containing elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, unique_b is a set containing the unique elements from the list b in each tuple of cases, unique_a is a set containing unique elements from list a in each tuple of cases, relevant_a is a set containing elements from unique_a where each element is less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set containing elements from unique_b where each element is less than or equal to k, only_a is a set containing elements from relevant_a that are not in relevant_b, only_b is a set containing elements from relevant_b that are not in relevant_a, results is a list with at least two additional elements 'NO', and the current value of total_distinct is 'NO' appended to the results list.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was already a list with at least two elements, appending `'NO'` increases its length by one. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition about `total_distinct` being less than `k` is not directly affected by this line of code.
