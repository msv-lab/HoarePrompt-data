Postcondition: `total_distinct` is equal to the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If `total_distinct` is less than `k`, then `results` is a list with 'NO' appended, and the loop or iteration continues. If `total_distinct` is not less than `k`, the list `results` remains unchanged.
