Output State: **`unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b` in each tuple of `cases`; `cases` is a non-empty list, each tuple in `cases` contains valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k` as specified, and arrays `a` and `b` in each tuple are valid lists of integers within the specified range; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from list `a` in each tuple of `cases`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` where each element is less than or equal to `k`.**

This means that the set `relevant_a` now contains only those elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to the value of `k`. The sets `unique_b` and `unique_a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
