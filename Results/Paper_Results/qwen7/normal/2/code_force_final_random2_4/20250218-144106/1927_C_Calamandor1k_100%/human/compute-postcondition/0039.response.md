Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` list is now contains 'NO' and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no specific loop was mentioned in the initial state, we assume it's part of a loop context. The values of `total_distinct` and the `results` list remain unchanged.
