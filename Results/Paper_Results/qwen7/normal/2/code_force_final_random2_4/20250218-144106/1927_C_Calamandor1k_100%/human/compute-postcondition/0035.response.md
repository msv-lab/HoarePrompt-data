The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop was specified in the initial state or the code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`both` is a set containing elements that are common to `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `unique_b` is updated to be a set containing the unique elements from the list `b`; `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from list `a`; `relevant_a` is now a set containing elements from `unique_a` where each element is less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is now a set containing elements from `unique_b` where each element is less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`; `results` is a list with at least two additional elements 'NO' and 'YES' appended to the results list, and 'NO' is added to `results`.**
