### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to determine if it's possible to select exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays `a` and `b` such that all integers from 1 to \(k\) are included among the chosen elements.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and initializes a list `cases` to store the details of each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts the necessary information (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) and stores them in the `cases` list.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to process these cases and determine the result for each one.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function iterates through each test case.
   - It creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to \(k\).
   - It calculates the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`), unique to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).
   - It checks if the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\). If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
   - It checks if the total number of distinct elements (`total_distinct`) is less than \(k\). If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it appends 'YES' to the results list.

4. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - The code correctly handles the constraints and checks for the conditions specified in the problem statement.
   - The logic for determining the possibility of choosing the required elements is sound and covers all edge cases mentioned in the problem.

5. **Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `t = int(input())`: Reads the number of test cases.
     - `cases = []`: Initializes an empty list to store test cases.
     - `for _ in range(t):`: Iterates through each test case.
       - `(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())`: Reads the dimensions and the value of \(k\).
       - `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Reads the elements of array `a`.
       - `b = list(map(int, input().split()))`: Reads the elements of array `b`.
       - `cases.append((n, m, k, a, b))`: Stores the test case details in the `cases` list.
   - **Processing Test Cases**:
     - `results = func_1(t, cases)`: Calls the function `func_1` to process the test cases.
     - `for result in results:`: Iterates through the results and prints each one.
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - `results = []`: Initializes an empty list to store the results.
     - `for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:`: Iterates through each test case.
       - `unique_a = set(a)`: Creates a set of unique elements in `a`.
       - `unique_b = set(b)`: Creates a set of unique elements in `b`.
       - `relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}`: Filters elements in `a` that are less than or equal to \(k\).
       - `relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}`: Filters elements in `b` that are less than or equal to \(k\).
       - `only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b`: Calculates elements unique to `a`.
       - `only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a`: Calculates elements unique to `b`.
       - `both = relevant_a & relevant_b`: Calculates elements common to both `a` and `b`.
       - `if len(only_a) > k // 2:`: Checks if the number of unique elements in `a` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\).
         - If true, appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
       - `if len(only_b) > k // 2:`: Checks if the number of unique elements in `b` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\).
         - If true, appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
       - `total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`: Calculates the total number of distinct elements.
       - `if total_distinct < k:`: Checks if the total number of distinct elements is less than \(k\).
         - If true, appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
       - `results.append('YES')`: Appends 'YES' to the results list if the conditions are met.

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose the required elements from both arrays. The code handles all edge cases and checks for the conditions specified in the problem statement accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
