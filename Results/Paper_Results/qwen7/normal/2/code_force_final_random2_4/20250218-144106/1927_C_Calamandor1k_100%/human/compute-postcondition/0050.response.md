Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `unique_a` is a set containing elements from `a`, `results` list now contains 'YES', `unique_b` is a set containing elements from `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are common in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.**

Explanation: The code `both = relevant_a & relevant_b` creates a new set `both` which contains elements that are present in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `total_distinct`, `unique_a`, `results`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b` remain unchanged, and the new set `both` is created based on the intersection of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
