Postcondition: **Both is a set containing elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, unique_b is a set containing the unique elements from the list b in each tuple of cases, unique_a is a set containing unique elements from list a in each tuple of cases, relevant_a is a set containing elements from unique_a where each element is less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set containing elements from unique_b where each element is less than or equal to k, only_a is a set containing elements from relevant_a that are not in relevant_b, only_b is a set containing elements from relevant_b that are not in relevant_a, results is a list with one additional element 'NO'. The length of only_b is greater than k // 2**
