Output State: **`both` is a set containing elements that are common to `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b` in each tuple of `cases`, `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from list `a` in each tuple of `cases`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` where each element is less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` where each element is less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`.**

Explanation: The code `both = relevant_a & relevant_b` creates a new set `both` that contains only the elements that are present in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. The other variables remain unchanged and retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
