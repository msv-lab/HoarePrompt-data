Output State: **The `results` list contains either 'NO' or 'YES' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed for all iterations, the `results` list will contain the outcome ('YES' or 'NO') for each test case evaluated according to the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, for each test case, if the conditions regarding the sets `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` are met, 'YES' is appended to the `results` list; otherwise, 'NO' is appended. The loop ensures that all test cases are processed, and the final `results` list reflects whether it was possible to choose `k` elements such that the conditions are satisfied for each test case.
