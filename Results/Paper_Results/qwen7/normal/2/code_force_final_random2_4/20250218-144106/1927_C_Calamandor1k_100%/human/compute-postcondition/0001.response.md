Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the following variables and objects:
   - `n`: The length of array `a`.
   - `m`: The length of array `b`.
   - `k`: The number of elements to be chosen.
   - `a`: The array of integers.
   - `b`: The array of integers.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables and objects**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `(n, m, k)` and two arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if there are at least one tuple in `cases`.
   - Each tuple in `cases` must contain valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k` as specified: \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot \min(n, m)\), and \(k\) is even.
   - The arrays `a` and `b` must be valid lists of integers within the specified range: \(1 \leq a_i, b_j \leq 10^6\).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `results` is an empty list, it does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - We need to ensure that `cases` is not an empty list and that each tuple in `cases` meets the specified conditions for `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `cases` must be a non-empty list.
- Each tuple in `cases` must contain valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k` as specified.
- Arrays `a` and `b` in each tuple must be valid lists of integers within the specified range.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`cases` is a non-empty list, each tuple in `cases` contains valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k` as specified, and arrays `a` and `b` in each tuple are valid lists of integers within the specified range.**
