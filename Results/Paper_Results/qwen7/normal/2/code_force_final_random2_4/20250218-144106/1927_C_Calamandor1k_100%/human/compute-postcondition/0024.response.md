Output State: **`both` is a set containing elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list b in the next tuple of cases, `unique_a` is updated to be a set containing the unique elements from list a, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` where each element is less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` where each element is less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `results` is a list with at least two additional elements 'NO' and 'YES' is appended to the results list.**

Explanation: The line `unique_a = set(a)` updates the variable `unique_a` to be a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
