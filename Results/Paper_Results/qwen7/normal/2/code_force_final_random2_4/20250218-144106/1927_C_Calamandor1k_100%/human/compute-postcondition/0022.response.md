Output State: **Both is a set containing elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, unique_b is a set containing the unique elements from the list b in each tuple of cases, unique_a is a set containing unique elements from list a in each tuple of cases, relevant_a is a set containing elements from unique_a where each element is less than or equal to k, relevant_b is a set containing elements from unique_b where each element is less than or equal to k, only_a is a set containing elements from relevant_a that are not in relevant_b, only_b is a set containing elements from relevant_b that are not in relevant_a, results is a list with at least two additional elements 'NO', and 'YES' is appended to the results list.**

In this case, the code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. Since the initial state of `results` includes at least two additional elements `'NO'`, appending `'YES'` does not change the fact that `results` contains at least two `'NO'` elements. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
