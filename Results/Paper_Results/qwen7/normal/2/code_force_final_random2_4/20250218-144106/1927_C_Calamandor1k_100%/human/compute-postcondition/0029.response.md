Output State: **`both` is a set containing elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, `unique_b` is updated to be a set containing the unique elements from the list b, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from list a, `relevant_a` is now a set containing elements from `unique_a` where each element is less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is now a set containing elements from `unique_b` where each element is less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `results` is a list with at least two additional elements 'NO' and 'YES' appended to the results list, `only_b` is updated to be `relevant_b - relevant_a`.**

In this output state, the only change is that `only_b` is updated to be the set difference between `relevant_b` and `relevant_a`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions as described in the initial state.
