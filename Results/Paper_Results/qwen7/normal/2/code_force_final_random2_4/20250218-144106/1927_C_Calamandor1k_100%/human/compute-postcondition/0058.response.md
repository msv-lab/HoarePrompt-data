Output State: **`total_distinct` is equal to the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total_distinct` to be the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. The sets `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` are derived from the sets `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, and `relevant_b`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
