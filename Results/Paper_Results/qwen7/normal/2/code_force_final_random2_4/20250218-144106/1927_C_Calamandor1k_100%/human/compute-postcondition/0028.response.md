Output State: **`both` is a set containing elements that are common to relevant_a and relevant_b, `unique_b` is updated to be a set containing the unique elements from the list b, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements from list a, `relevant_a` is now a set containing elements from `unique_a` where each element is less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is now a set containing elements from `unique_b` where each element is less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `results` is a list with at least two additional elements 'NO' and 'YES' appended to the results list, `only_a` is updated to be `relevant_a - relevant_b`.**

Explanation: The code `only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b` updates the set `only_a` to contain only the elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
