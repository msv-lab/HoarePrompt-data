Output State: **`total_distinct` is equal to the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` is a list with 'YES' appended.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. The condition checking whether `total_distinct` is less than `k` does not affect the current state since it is outside the scope of the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state retains the initial postcondition for `total_distinct` and updates `results` by appending `'YES'` to it.
