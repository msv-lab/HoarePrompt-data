Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, m, k) representing the length of array a, the length of array b, and the number of elements to be chosen, respectively. Additionally, n, m, and k satisfy 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), and k is even. Arrays a and b are represented as lists of integers, where each element in a and b satisfies 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6. The sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The line `results = []` initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the value of `t` or the structure of the `cases` variable. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `results` being an empty list.
