Postcondition: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `unique_a` is a set containing elements from `a`, `results` list now contains 'NO', `unique_b` is a set containing elements from `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are common in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.**

This postcondition describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `len(only_b) > k // 2` is true, the results list is updated to contain 'NO'. If the condition is false, no changes are made to the sets, and the results list remains unchanged.
