Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` list now contains 'NO'**.

The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. The values of `total_distinct`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `both`, and any other variables not affected by the code remain unchanged.
