Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes the string `s` to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - It maintains two strings, `s1` and `s2`:
     - `s1` accumulates the characters from `s` that are in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
     - `s2` accumulates the characters from `s` that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It also uses a set `alphabet` to keep track of the characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets seen so far.
   - After processing the string `s`, it checks if all characters in `alphabet` have been seen (`len(alphabet) == 0`).
   - If `len(alphabet) != 0`, it means not all characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets were seen, and it calculates the remaining part needed to form a valid subsequence.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic checks the result of `func_1`:
     - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES".
     - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `s2 + be9i` where `be9i` is a string of length `n - len(s2)` using the character `chr(i)` that was not seen in `s1`.

### Detailed Check:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function correctly accumulates characters from `s` into `s1` and `s2`.
   - The logic to check if all characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are seen is correct.
   - The construction of `be9i` ensures that the string `s2 + be9i` is of length `n` and uses characters not seen in `s1`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic correctly handles both cases:
     - If all characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are seen, it prints "YES".
     - If not all characters are seen, it prints "NO" and constructs a valid string `s2 + be9i`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. It also correctly handles the case where not all such strings are subsequences by constructing and printing one such string.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
