Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the string `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over each character in the string `s`, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to the first character of the string `s`.

3. **Determine the state of `s`**: The string `s` is given as a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

4. **Determine the state of other variables**: The variables `s1`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `alphabet` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be the first character of the string `s`.
- `s` remains as a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is the first character of `s`, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets**.
