Postcondition: `i` is the first character of `s`, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `len(alphabet) != 1`, then `i` is not in the alphabet and the current length of the alphabet is `k-1`. Otherwise, `s2` is a string containing the character `i`.
