Output State: **`i` is the first character of `s`, `s2` is a string containing the character `i`, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and the length of `alphabet` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `s2 += i` appends the character `i` to the string `s2`. Initially, `s2` is an empty string, so after executing this line, `s2` will contain the character `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
