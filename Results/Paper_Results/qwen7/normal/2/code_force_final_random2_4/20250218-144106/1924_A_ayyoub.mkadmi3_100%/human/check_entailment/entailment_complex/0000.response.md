Reasoning:

1. The main program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in the given string `s`.
3. The function `func_1` correctly filters out characters from `s` that are not in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, constructing `s1` and `s2` accordingly.
4. The function then checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k` and returns the necessary values.
5. Based on the return values from `func_1`, the main program correctly prints "YES" or "NO" and, if applicable, a string of length `n` that cannot be found as a subsequence in `s`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the annotated program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
