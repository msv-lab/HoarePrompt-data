#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The `arr` list is now empty, and `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each stick length that was originally in the `arr` list.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, every stick length in the original `arr` list has been processed exactly once. Therefore, the `arr` list becomes empty since all elements have been removed. The `freq` dictionary contains each unique stick length from the original list as keys, with their respective frequencies as values, which were incremented during each iteration of the loop.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4, where the frequencies are the values in the `freq` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks. It calculates the frequency of each stick length, then returns the sum of the integer division of these frequencies by 4.
