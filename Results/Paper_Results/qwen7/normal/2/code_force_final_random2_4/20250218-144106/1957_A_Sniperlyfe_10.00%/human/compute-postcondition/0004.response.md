Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element, `n` is the first element in the list, `freq` is a dictionary where the key is `n` and the value is the frequency of `n` in `arr` increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the frequency of `n` in the `freq` dictionary. Since `n` is the first element in the list `arr`, the frequency of `n` in `arr` is increased by 1. The updated frequency is stored in the dictionary `freq` under the key `n`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
