Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `n` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. The variable `n` takes the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `arr` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element.
   - `n` is the first element in the list.
   - `freq` is a dictionary where the key is `n` and the value is the frequency of `n` in `arr` increased by 1.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `n` is the first element in the list `arr` at the end of the previous iteration, the next element in the list will be the second element.
   - Therefore, `n` will now be the second element in the list `arr`.
   - The list `arr` itself remains the same unless modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, we assume it stays the same.
   - The dictionary `freq` will be updated based on the new value of `n`.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `arr` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` becomes the second element in the list `arr`.
   - `freq` will be updated to reflect the frequency of the new value of `n`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers with at least one element, `n` is the second element in the list, `freq` is a dictionary where the key is `n` and the value is the frequency of `n` in `arr`**.
