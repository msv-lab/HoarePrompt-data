Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the first element in the list, `freq` is a dictionary where the key is `n` and the value is the frequency of `n` in `arr` increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency of the first element `n` in the list `arr` using the `freq` dictionary. The line `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1` checks if `n` is already a key in the dictionary `freq`. If it is, it retrieves its current value (which is the frequency of `n` in `arr`), increments it by 1, and assigns the new value back to `freq[n]`. If `n` is not in `freq`, it initializes `freq[n]` to 1. Therefore, the frequency of `n` in the `freq` dictionary is now one more than it was before.
