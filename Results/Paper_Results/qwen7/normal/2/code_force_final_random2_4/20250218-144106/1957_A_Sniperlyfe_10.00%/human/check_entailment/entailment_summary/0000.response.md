Reasoning:
The provided program aims to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given stick lengths. The approach taken in the `func_1` function is to count the frequency of each stick length and then calculate how many complete polygons can be formed by dividing the frequency of each length by 4 (since each polygon requires 4 equal sides).

Here's a breakdown of the steps in the program:
1. The program reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks and their lengths.
3. It calls the `func_1` function with the list of stick lengths.
4. In `func_1`, it uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each stick length.
5. It then calculates the sum of the integer division of these frequencies by 4.

This logic correctly identifies the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed because:
- Each polygon requires 4 sticks of the same length.
- By dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4, we get the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with that length.
- Summing these values gives the total number of polygons that can be formed.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs as described.

Correctness: **True**
