Output State: **`arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, and `arr[i-1]` is equal to `nums[0]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[0]` to `arr[i-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `arr[i-1]` is updated to the value of `nums[0]`, while `arr`, `i`, and `nums` retain their original conditions.
