Output State: **`i` is between 1 and `m-2`, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first element of `nums`, `arr[i]` is the second element of `nums`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code converts `arr[i - 1]` to a list of its digits and appends `arr[i]` to this list. Since `arr[i - 1]` was already a number, converting it to a string and then to a list of integers gives us the digits of `arr[i - 1]`. The variable `arr[i]` remains unchanged in terms of its value, but it is now the second element in the list `nums`. The conditions regarding the sorting of `nums` and the value of `ans` are not directly addressed by this line of code, so they remain as per the initial state.
