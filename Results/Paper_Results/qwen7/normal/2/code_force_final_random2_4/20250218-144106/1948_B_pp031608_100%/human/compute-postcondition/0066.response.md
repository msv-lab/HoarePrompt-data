Output State: **`i` is between 0 and m-3, `m` must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `arr[i]` is either unchanged or adjusted such that if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to `False`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` by converting the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` into a list of integers and appending `arr[i]` to it. The conditions involving `i`, `m`, `arr[i - 1]`, and `arr[i]` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` may be affected by the condition `if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, but since no such condition is explicitly given in the code, `ans` remains as it was before.
