Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is between 0 and `m-3`, `m` must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `arr[i]` is either unchanged or adjusted such that if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to `False`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` sets the variable `ans` to `False`. The values of `i`, `m`, `nums`, and the condition related to `arr[i]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
