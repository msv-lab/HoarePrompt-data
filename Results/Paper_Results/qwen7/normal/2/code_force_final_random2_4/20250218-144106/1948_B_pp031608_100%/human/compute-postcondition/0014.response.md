Postcondition: `ans` is False, `m` must be a positive integer, `i` must be at least 0, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the last digit of `arr[i-1]`, and the list `nums` contains the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If the list `nums` is not sorted, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
