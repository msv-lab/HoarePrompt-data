Postcondition: `ans` remains False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, and `nums` is a list containing the first digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, the loop breaks; otherwise, the loop continues without changing any variables.
