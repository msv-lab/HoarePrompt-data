Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`, `m`, and the range parameters.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `n` is decremented by 1 (though `n` is not directly used in the loop).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m - 1`. Specifically, the loop will run for values of `i` starting from `m - 1` down to 1 (since the upper bound is exclusive).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be within the range defined by `range(m - 1, 0, -1)`. Since `i` is initially 0, it needs to be adjusted to be within the valid range.
   - `m` must be greater than 1 because if `m` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is between 1 and m-1, `m` must be greater than 1**.
