Output State: **`ans` remains False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, and `nums` is a list containing the first digit of `arr[i-1]` and the current value of `arr[i]` converted to integers, and `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be the first digit of `nums`.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to be the first digit of `nums`. Since `nums` is a list containing the first digit of `arr[i-1]` and the current value of `arr[i]` converted to integers, the first digit of `nums` is the same as the first digit of `arr[i-1]`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
