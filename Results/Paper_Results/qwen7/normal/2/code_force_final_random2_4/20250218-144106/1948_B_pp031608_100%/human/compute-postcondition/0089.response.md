Output State: **`arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array such that the element at index `i-1` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, and `ans` is `False` if the elements in `nums` are not sorted (i.e., not in non-decreasing order).**

Explanation: The code updates the element at index `i-1` in the array `arr` to be equal to the first element of the list `nums`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is now `nums[0]`, while `i`, `nums`, and `ans` retain their original relationships and values.
