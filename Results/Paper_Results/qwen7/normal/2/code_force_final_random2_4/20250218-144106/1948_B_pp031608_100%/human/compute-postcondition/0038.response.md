Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is `False`.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `0`.
- The final value of `arr[0]` is the first digit of the original `arr[0]` if no further conditions in the loop were met to change it.

The print statement is:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

Given that `ans` is `False`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` will evaluate to `'NO'` because the index `[False]` corresponds to the first element in the list, which is `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
