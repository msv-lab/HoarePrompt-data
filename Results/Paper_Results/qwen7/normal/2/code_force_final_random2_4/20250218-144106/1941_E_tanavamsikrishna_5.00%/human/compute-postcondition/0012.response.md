Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d, all of which are integers with specific constraints. It also accepts a list named rows, which contains n lists. Each inner list has m positive integers, and the first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0. Based on these inputs, the function returns a value indicating the result of some operation or condition related to the river depths represented by the rows list.**

Note: The exact nature of the operation or condition is not specified in the given information, so the description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
