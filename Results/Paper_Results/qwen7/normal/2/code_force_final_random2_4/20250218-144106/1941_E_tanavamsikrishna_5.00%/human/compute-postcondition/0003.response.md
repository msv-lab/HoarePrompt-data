Output State: **`total_costs` is an empty list, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers (depths of the river cells), and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0; `costs` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `total_costs`. The initial state of `rows` and `costs` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on these variables within the given code snippet.
