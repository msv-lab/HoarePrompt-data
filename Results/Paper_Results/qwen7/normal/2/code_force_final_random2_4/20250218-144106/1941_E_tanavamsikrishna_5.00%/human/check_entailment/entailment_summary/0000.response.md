### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges over consecutive rows in a river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the start and end of the row, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes a single row to calculate the cost of placing supports such that the distance constraint is satisfied.
   - It updates each element in the row based on the minimum cost from a sliding window of size `d+1` plus one, ensuring the distance constraint is met.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the entire grid to find the minimum cost for building `k` bridges over consecutive rows.
   - It uses `func_1` to compute the cost for each row and then finds the minimum sum of costs for every possible sequence of `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Verification of Function `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly computes the cost for a single row by ensuring the distance constraint is met and updating the row accordingly.
   - The sliding window approach ensures that the cost calculation respects the distance constraint.

5. **Verification of Function `func_2`:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly computes the cost for each possible sequence of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to form the costs list and then finds the minimum sum of these costs.
   - The implementation handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Given the detailed breakdown and the correctness of both functions in meeting the problem requirements, the overall program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
