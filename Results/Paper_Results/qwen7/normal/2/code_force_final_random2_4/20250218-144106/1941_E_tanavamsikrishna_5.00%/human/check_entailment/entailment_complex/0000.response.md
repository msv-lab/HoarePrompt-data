Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `row` and an integer `d` as input.
   - It first increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by their respective indices.
   - Then, it updates the remaining elements of `row` by setting them to the minimum value of a sliding window of size `d+1` plus one.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the updated `row`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` takes four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` and a list of `n` lists `rows` as input.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row in `rows` to get a list of costs.
   - It then calculates the sum of costs for every possible subsequence of length `k` in the costs list.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum sum of these subsequences.

3. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The problem requires building `k` bridges on consecutive rows with the minimum total cost of installing supports.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns of each row.
   - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

4. **Verification**:
   - `func_1` correctly implements the logic to update the row based on the given constraints.
   - `func_2` correctly calculates the cost for each row using `func_1` and then finds the minimum cost for every possible subsequence of length `k`.
   - The logic in `func_2` ensures that the cost calculation meets the problem's requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
