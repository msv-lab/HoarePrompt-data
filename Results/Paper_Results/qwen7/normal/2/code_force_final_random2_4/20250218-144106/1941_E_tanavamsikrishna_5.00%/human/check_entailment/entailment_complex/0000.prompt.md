Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

        func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of river cells in a row, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports.
def func_1(row, d):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `i` is `d-1`; each element `row[i]` from index 0 to `d-2` has been incremented by its respective index value (i.e., `row[0]` is incremented by 0, `row[1]` by 1, ..., `row[d-2]` by `d-2`).
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `d-1`, and each element in the `row` list from index 0 up to `d-2` will have been incremented by its own index value.
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
        
    #State: The value of `i` is `len(row)`, each element `row[i]` from index 0 to `len(row)-1` has been updated to the minimum value of the slice `row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]` plus 1, if `i` is greater than 0; otherwise, it is set to 0 plus the original value of `row[i]` plus 1.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list 'row', which has been updated according to the specified rules.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d`. It updates each element in `row` based on specific rules: first, it increments elements from index 0 to `d-2` by their respective indices. Then, it updates elements from index `d-1` to the end by setting them to the minimum value of a sliding window of size `d+1` plus one. Finally, it returns the last element of the updated `row` list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m, k, d) are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells. The first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `total_costs` now contains the sum of costs from index `i` to `i + k - 1` for every possible `i` such that `0 <= i <= len(costs) - k`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs[i] is the sum of costs from index i to i + k - 1 for every possible i such that 0 <= i <= len(costs) - k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d, all of which are integers with specific constraints. It also accepts a list named rows, which contains n lists. Each inner list has m positive integers, and the first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0. The function calculates the minimum sum of costs over every possible subsequence of length k in the costs list, which itself is derived from the input rows list using another function func_1. Finally, it prints this minimum sum.
