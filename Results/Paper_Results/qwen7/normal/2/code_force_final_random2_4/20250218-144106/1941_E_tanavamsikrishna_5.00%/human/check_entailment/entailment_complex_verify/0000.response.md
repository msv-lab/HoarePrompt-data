### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to build \( k \) bridges over \( k \) consecutive rows in a river grid.
- Each bridge must satisfy the condition that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than \( d \).
- The cost to install a support in cell \((i, j)\) is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \).

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` is intended to update the costs for a single row based on the given constraints.
- The first loop increments the first \( d-1 \) elements by their respective indices.
- The second loop updates the remaining elements based on the minimum cost within a sliding window of size \( d+1 \).

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- `func_2` processes each row using `func_1` and then calculates the total cost for each possible subsequence of length \( k \).
- It then finds the minimum total cost among these subsequences.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and logic flow of both functions.
- The `func_1` function does indeed handle the cost calculation as described, ensuring that the distance constraint is satisfied.
- The `func_2` function correctly computes the total costs and finds the minimum.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the example provided in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
3 11 1 4
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```

The program outputs `4`, which matches the expected result. This suggests that the program works correctly for this specific example.

#### More Complex Scenario:
Now, let's consider the more complex scenario provided in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
4 5 2 5
0 1 1 1 0
0 2 2 2 0
0 2 1 1 0
0 3 2 1 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
15
```

The program outputs `15`, which is incorrect. Let's manually compute the costs for each row:

1. **Row 1:** `0 1 1 1 0`
   - After processing: `1 2 3 4 1`
   - Minimum cost: `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 11`

2. **Row 2:** `0 2 2 2 0`
   - After processing: `1 3 4 5 1`
   - Minimum cost: `1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 14`

3. **Row 3:** `0 2 1 1 0`
   - After processing: `1 3 2 3 1`
   - Minimum cost: `1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 10`

4. **Row 4:** `0 3 2 1 0`
   - After processing: `1 4 3 2 1`
   - Minimum cost: `1 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 11`

The total costs for the subsequences of length 2 are:
- Subsequence 1-2: `11 + 14 = 25`
- Subsequence 2-3: `14 + 10 = 24`
- Subsequence 3-4: `10 + 11 = 21`

The minimum total cost is `21`, not `15`.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly handle the cost calculations for the more complex scenario, indicating an error in the logic.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges in all scenarios.

**Final: False**
