Output State: **`rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers (depths of the river cells), and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0; `costs` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `costs` by applying the function `func_1(row, d)` to each row in the `rows` list. Each row is a list of `m` integers, and the first and last elements of each row are 0. The function `func_1` is applied to each row with `d` as an argument, resulting in a new integer value for each row. The `rows` list remains unchanged, but now there is a new list `costs` containing the results of these function applications.
