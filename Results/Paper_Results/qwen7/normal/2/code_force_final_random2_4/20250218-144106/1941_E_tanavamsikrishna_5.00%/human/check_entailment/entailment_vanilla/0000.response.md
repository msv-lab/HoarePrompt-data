Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single row to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports under the given constraints.
   - It iterates through the row and updates the cost of placing a support at each position.
   - Specifically, for each cell `i`:
     - If `i < d - 1`, it simply adds 1 to the current depth value.
     - For `i >= d - 1`, it calculates the minimum cost by considering the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells plus the current depth plus 1.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the processed row, which represents the total cost for that row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` for each test case.
   - It then reads `n` rows of depths and processes each row using `func_1`.
   - It calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost among these sets.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` seems correct. It correctly calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in a single row under the given constraints.
   - The approach uses dynamic programming to ensure that the distance constraint is respected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The logic in `func_2` also appears correct. It correctly processes each test case by reading the input, calculating the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finding the minimum cost for any `k` consecutive rows.
   - The use of slicing (`costs[i:i + k]`) to get the cost of `k` consecutive rows and then summing them up is appropriate.
   - The final step of finding the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows is correct.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. There are no logical errors or inefficiencies that would make the program incorrect.

### Final Answer
