Output State: **`total_costs` now contains the sum of costs from index `i` to `i + k - 1` for every possible `i` such that `0 <= i <= len(costs) - k`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `total_costs` will contain the sum of every possible subarray of `costs` with length `k`. This means if there are `n` elements in `costs`, the loop will run `n - (k - 1)` times, and for each iteration, it will compute the sum of `k` consecutive elements starting from the current index `i` and append that sum to `total_costs`.
