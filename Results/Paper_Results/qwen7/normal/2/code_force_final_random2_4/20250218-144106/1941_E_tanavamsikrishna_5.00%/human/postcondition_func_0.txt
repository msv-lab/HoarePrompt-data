The function `func_1` accepts a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d`. It updates each element in `row` based on specific rules: first, it increments elements from index 0 to `d-2` by their respective indices. Then, it updates elements from index `d-1` to the end by setting them to the minimum value of a sliding window of size `d+1` plus one. Finally, it returns the last element of the updated `row` list.
