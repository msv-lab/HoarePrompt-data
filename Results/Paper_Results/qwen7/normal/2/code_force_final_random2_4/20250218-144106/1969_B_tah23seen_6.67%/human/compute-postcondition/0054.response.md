Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s`, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `right < len(s)` will no longer be satisfied because `right` will be equal to the length of `s`. This means the loop has finished executing. At this point, `right` will be set to `len(s)`, which is the same as `right + 1` since `right` was incremented in the loop until it reached the length of `s`. Therefore, the final state of `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and none of the other variables (`sChar`, `i`, `s`, `left`, `cost`) are affected by the loop and thus remain unchanged from their last known state before the loop started.
