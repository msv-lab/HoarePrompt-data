Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and for every index `j` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `s[j]` must not be '0'.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `right` will be equal to the length of the list `s`, indicating that the loop has processed all characters in `s`. Additionally, none of the characters in `s` are '0', as the condition inside the loop increments `right` only if `s[right]` is not '0'. The values of `left` and `cost` remain unchanged at 1 and 2, respectively.
Code of the loop:
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    left += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 2, `cost` is 2, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and for every index `j` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `s[j]` must not be '0', and `len(s)` must be greater than 1 and `s[1]` must not be '1'
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `s` must have more than 2 elements and `s[2]` must not be '1'; `left` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `s` must have more than 2 elements, `s[2]` must not be '1', `left` is `left + 1`, and `s[left + 1]` must not be '1'


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
