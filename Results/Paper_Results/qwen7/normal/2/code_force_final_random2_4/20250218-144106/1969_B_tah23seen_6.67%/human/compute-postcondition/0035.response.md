Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
   - `left` is equal to the length of the list `s`.
   - `cost` is 2.
   - `right` is equal to the length of `s`.
   - For every index `j` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `s[j]` must not be '0'.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `left <= right` and `right < len(s)` and `left < len(s)`.

3. **Behavior Inside the Loop:**
   - The loop increments `left` as long as `left` is less than the length of `s` and `s[left]` is not '1'.
   - The loop increments `right` as long as `s[right]` is not '0'.

4. **Final States:**
   - After processing all characters in `s`, `left` will be equal to the length of `s`.
   - `cost` remains 2.
   - `right` remains the length of `s`.

5. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `left <= right` must still hold true.
   - Since `left` is already equal to the length of `s`, the condition `left <= right` will only hold true if `right` is also equal to the length of `s`.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `right` is equal to the length of `s` for the loop to continue.
   - All other states (`sChar`, `i`, `s`, `cost`, `left`) do not need adjustment since they will remain the same in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `right`.

**Answer:**
State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s`, `cost` is 2, `right` is equal to the length of `s` and must be equal to the length of `s`, and for every index `j` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `s[j]` must not be '0'**.
