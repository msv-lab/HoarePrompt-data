Output State: **The program returns a cost of 16**

Explanation: Based on the given initial state and the provided code snippet, the variable `cost` is set to 16. The loop does not change the value of `cost` as it only updates `left` and `right` and increments `cost` based on the difference between `right` and `left`. Since the loop runs three more times after the initial three iterations and the cost doubles each time, the final `cost` remains 16. Therefore, the program returns a cost of 16.
