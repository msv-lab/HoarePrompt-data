Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the next character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing each character of the original `sChar` with the additional character `i`.**

Explanation: The code `s.append(i)` appends the character `i` to the list `s`. The initial state tells us that `s` is a list containing each character of the original `sChar` with the additional character `i`. After executing the code, `s` now includes all characters from `sChar` plus the character `i`. The values of `sChar` and `i` remain unchanged.
