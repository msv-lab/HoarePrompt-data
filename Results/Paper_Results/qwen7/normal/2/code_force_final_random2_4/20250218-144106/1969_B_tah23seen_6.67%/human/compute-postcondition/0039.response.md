Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `right < len(s)` and `s[right] != '0'`.

2. **Analyze the initial state**:
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
   - `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1.
   - `cost` is 4 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `right` is equal to the length of `s`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `right` must be less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` must not be `'0'`.
   - Since `right` is initially set to the length of `s`, the condition `right < len(s)` is already satisfied.
   - Therefore, the critical condition is `s[right] != '0'`.

4. **Ensure the loop can execute the first time**:
   - If `s[right]` is `'0'`, the loop will not execute at all.
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `s[right]` must not be `'0'`.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `s[right]` to ensure it is not `'0'`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and `s[right]` must not be '0'**
