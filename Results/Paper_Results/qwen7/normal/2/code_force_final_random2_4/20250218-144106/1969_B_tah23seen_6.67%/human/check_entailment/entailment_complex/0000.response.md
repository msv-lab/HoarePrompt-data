Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly defines the function `func_1` which aims to sort a binary string `sChar` by performing cyclic shifts on substrings and calculating the minimum cost required to achieve a sorted string.
2. The function initializes variables `left`, `cost`, and `right` to track the positions and calculate the cost of operations.
3. The while loop iterates through the string to find positions where a '0' should precede a '1' and performs the necessary cyclic shifts, updating the cost accordingly.
4. However, the provided explanation and the final cost of 16 in the example do not align with the problem's requirements. The cost calculation seems to follow a specific pattern rather than being based on the actual operations needed to sort the string.
5. The logic in the while loop is flawed because it does not correctly identify and handle all necessary cyclic shifts to sort the string. It incorrectly assumes a fixed pattern for the cost calculation.
6. For instance, consider the string "101011". The correct approach would involve multiple cyclic shifts to move all '1's to the left and all '0's to the right, but the current implementation does not capture this complexity.
7. The provided example and explanation suggest an incorrect cost calculation method, which does not reflect the actual minimum cost required to sort the string.

Correctness: **False**
