Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `left < len(s) and s[left] != '1'`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0'.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
   - `left` is equal to the length of the list `s`.
   - `cost` is 4.
   - `right` is equal to the length of `s`.
   - `left` is increased by 1.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, two conditions must be met:
     1. `left < len(s)`
     2. `s[left] != '1'`

4. **Current Values**:
   - `left` is equal to the length of the list `s`.
   - `len(s)` is the same as `right`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `left` is already equal to `len(s)`, the first condition `left < len(s)` cannot be satisfied.
   - Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `left` or `len(s)` to satisfy the loop condition.
   - We need to ensure that `s[left] != '1'` holds true for the next iteration. However, since `left` is already equal to `len(s)`, this condition cannot be checked until `left` is incremented again.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `left`, but since `left` is already equal to `len(s)`, it cannot be adjusted to satisfy the loop condition directly.
   - Instead, we need to ensure that the loop can proceed by incrementing `left` to a position where `s[left] != '1'`.

Given the constraints and the current state, the only way to proceed is to ensure that `left` is incremented to a valid position where the loop condition can be met.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` + 1, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`**.
