Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in sChar:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `sChar`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `sChar` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000.
   - `s` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each character in `sChar`. For the loop to execute, `sChar` must contain at least one character. Since `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, it will always have at least one character.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `sChar` is a valid binary string and has at least one character.
   - The variable `i` will take on the value of each character in `sChar` during each iteration of the loop.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `sChar` must be a non-empty binary string.
- `i` will take on the value of each character in `sChar` during each iteration.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` will take on the value of each character in `sChar` during each iteration**.
