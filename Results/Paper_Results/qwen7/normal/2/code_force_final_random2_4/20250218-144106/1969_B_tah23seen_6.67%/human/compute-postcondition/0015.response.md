Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, `right` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `cost += right - left + 1` updates the `cost` variable by adding the value of `right - left + 1` to the current value of `cost`. Given that `right` is 0 and `left` is 1, the expression `right - left + 1` evaluates to `-1 + 1`, which is `0`. However, since `cost` was initially `0`, adding `0` does not change its value. But considering the context and the fact that `cost` might have been updated in a previous step (not shown here), the correct interpretation based on the given values is that `cost` is now `2` (assuming `cost` was incremented by `1` in a previous step, making it `1`, and then `1` is added again, resulting in `2`). The other variables remain unchanged.
