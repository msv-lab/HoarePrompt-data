Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 2, `cost` is 2, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and for every index `j` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `s[j]` must not be '0', and `len(s)` must be greater than 1 and `s[1]` must not be '1'**.

Explanation: The variable `left` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
