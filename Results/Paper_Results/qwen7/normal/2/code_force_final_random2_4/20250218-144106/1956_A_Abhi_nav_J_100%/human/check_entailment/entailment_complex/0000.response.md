Reasoning:
1. The provided program is supposed to simulate a game where players are removed based on positions defined by the sequence `a`. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required for the game.
2. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `a` (a list of integers representing the sequence `a`) and `b` (an integer representing `n_i`). The function's logic is flawed because:
   - It should process each `n_i` independently and determine how many players remain after each round of removals.
   - Instead, the function simply returns either `a - 1` if `a <= b` or `b` otherwise, which does not reflect the game's rules.
3. To correctly implement the game logic, we need to:
   - Keep track of the current number of players.
   - Remove players at positions specified by `a` in each round.
   - Continue removing until no more players can be removed in a round.
   - Count the remaining players as winners.

Given these points, the provided function does not correctly simulate the game, and thus the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
