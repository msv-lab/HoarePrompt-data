Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, n)`. This means `i` should be less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))`
   - `check_all_new` retains its previous value
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `a[i - 1] > a[i]`

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must remain at least 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be 3 (since it starts from 1 and increments by 1)
   - `n` must still be at least 2

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2**
