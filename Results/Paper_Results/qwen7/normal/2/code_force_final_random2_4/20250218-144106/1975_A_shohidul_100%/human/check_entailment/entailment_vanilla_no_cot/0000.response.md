Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initial Check**: The initial check `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If this is true, it prints 'YES', which is correct.

2. **Secondary Check**: For the secondary check, the code attempts to find a split point where the array can be split into two parts such that the entire array becomes non-decreasing. However, the logic here is flawed:
   - It only checks if the first element of the original array (`a[0]`) is greater than or equal to each element in the second part (`new`). This is not sufficient to ensure the array can be made non-decreasing.
   - It also checks if the second part itself is sorted, but this alone is not enough to guarantee the entire array can be made non-decreasing by swapping.

To fix this, the program should:
- Identify the split point where the array can be divided into two parts such that the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing.
- Ensure that the last element of the first part is less than or equal to the first element of the second part.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already sorted
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Find the split point
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                # Check if the array can be split at index i
                if all(a[j] <= a[i] for j in range(i)) and all(a[k] >= a[i] for k in range(i, n)):
                    print('YES')
                    break
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.
