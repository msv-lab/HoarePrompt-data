Output State: **`i` is 3; `new` is a slice from index 3 onwards of the original sequence `a`; `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `check_all_new` by checking if all elements in the slice `new` (which starts from index 3 onwards) are greater than or equal to the first element of the original sequence `a`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3, and `new` remains a slice from index 3 onwards of the original sequence `a`. The value of `check_all_new` is determined by the condition but is not explicitly assigned a value in the given code snippet, so it is described as a boolean value based on the condition.
