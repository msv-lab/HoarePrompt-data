Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range specified as `range(1, n)`. This means `i` will take values starting from 1 up to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the initial value of `i` should be set to 1.

3. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Consider Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `check_all`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` should be 1, and `n` should be greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
