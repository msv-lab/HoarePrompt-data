Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is an input integer (its specific value is not relevant for this particular print statement).
- `new` starts from `a[2]` and onwards, meaning `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from the third element.
- `check_all_new` is determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`. Given that `i` is 2, this condition checks if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `new[0]`.
- `new_all` is True because the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])` is met, indicating that `new` is a non-decreasing list.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will directly print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
