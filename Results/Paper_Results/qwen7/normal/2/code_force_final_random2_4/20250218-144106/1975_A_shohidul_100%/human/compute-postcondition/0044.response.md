Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` is the original list or sequence, and `new` is a slice from index 3 onwards of `a`. In either case (if or else), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i-1] > a[i]`, then `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]` and `new_all` is the result of the comparison `(new[i-1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))`. If the condition `a[i-1] > a[i]` is not met, the same conditions apply as they do in the if part.
