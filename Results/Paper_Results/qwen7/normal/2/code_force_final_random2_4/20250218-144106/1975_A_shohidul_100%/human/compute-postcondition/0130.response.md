Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 3; `new` is a slice from index 3 to the end of the original sequence.**

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` creates a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 3) to the end of the list. Since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `a`, we only know that `new` will be a slice from index 3 onwards. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
