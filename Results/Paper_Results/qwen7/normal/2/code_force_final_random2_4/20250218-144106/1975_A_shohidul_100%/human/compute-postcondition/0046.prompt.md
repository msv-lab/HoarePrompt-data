Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 such that the first element is greater than the second element
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy the condition `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `new`. If the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` does not hold, the same values of `check_all_new` and `new_all` as before the if statement are retained.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(new[i-1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))`, `check_all_new` retains its previous value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `new` is a slice from index 3 onwards of the original list or sequence `a`. In either case (if or else), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]` and `new_all` is the result of the comparison `(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))`. If the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is not met, the same conditions apply as they would in the if part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
