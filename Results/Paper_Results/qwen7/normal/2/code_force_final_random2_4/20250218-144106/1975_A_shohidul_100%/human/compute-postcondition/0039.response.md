Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3.
- `new` is a slice from index 3 onwards of the original list or sequence `a`.
- `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is the result of the comparison `(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))`.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
