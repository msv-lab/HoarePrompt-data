Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains only one unique character. If it does, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by either the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` or its reverse, depending on which comes first alphabetically.**
