Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the size of the set `a` is 1, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `a` has more than one unique character, `b` is either equal to the sorted version of `s` or not equal to it, and `c` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order.
