Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `s` is an input string.
- `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`.
- The length of `a` is not equal to 1.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
