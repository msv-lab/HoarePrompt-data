Postcondition: **`f` remains 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, otherwise `a[i]` and `b[i]` swap their values.**

This means that if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `f` stays as 1, and `a[i]` and `b[i]` swap their values. If `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, `f` remains 1, and `a[i]` and `b[i]` keep their original values.
