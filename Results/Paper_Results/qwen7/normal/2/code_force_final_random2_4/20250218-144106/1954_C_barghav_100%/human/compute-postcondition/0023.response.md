Postcondition: `a` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is 0, and `f` is 1 if `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, otherwise `f` is 0. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `a[i]` is set to the previous value of `b[i]` and `b[i]` is set to the previous value of `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged.
