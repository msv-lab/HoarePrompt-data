Output State: **`a[i]` is now equal to the original value of `b[i]`; `b[i]` is now equal to the original value of `a[i]`; `f` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `f = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `f`. This does not affect the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` which remain as they were in the initial state.
