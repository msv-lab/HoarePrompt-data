Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: 
   - `a` and `b` are strings.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `b` must have a length of 3.

2. Analysis:
   - Since `b` must have a length of 3, it cannot have an index 4 because string indices are zero-based and range from 0 to 2 (inclusive).
   - Therefore, accessing `b[i]` where `i` is 4 will result in an IndexError.

Given this analysis, the print statement will raise an IndexError and stop execution without printing anything meaningful. However, based on the question's format, we need to describe what would be printed if no error occurred.

Since the question asks for the output and we know that accessing an invalid index will cause an error, we should describe the intended scenario if no error were raised.

Output: **IndexError: string index out of range**
