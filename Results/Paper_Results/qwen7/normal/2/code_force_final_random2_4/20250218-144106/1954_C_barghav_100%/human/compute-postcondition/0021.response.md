Postcondition: `a` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is 0, and `f` is not 0, and if the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i]`, then `a[i]` is now equal to the previous value of `b[i]` and `b[i]` is now equal to the previous value of `a[i]`. If the condition `a[i] > b[i]` is false, the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged.
