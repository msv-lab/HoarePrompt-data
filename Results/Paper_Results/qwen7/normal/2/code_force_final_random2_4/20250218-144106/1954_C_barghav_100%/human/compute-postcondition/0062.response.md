Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` and `b` are strings.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `b` must have a length of 3.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - Since `b` is a string with a length of 3, it can be represented as `b = "xyz"` where `x`, `y`, and `z` are characters.
   - The value of `i` is 4, but since `b` only has 3 characters, accessing `b[4]` will result in an `IndexError` if we were to consider the string as 0-indexed. However, the question asks us to determine what will be printed, and based on the precondition, we should focus on the given conditions.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(b[i], end='')`.
   - Given `i` is 4 and `b` has a length of 3, `b[i]` would be out of bounds if we consider the string as 0-indexed. But since the precondition does not specify any error handling or change in behavior for out-of-bound indices, we should consider the exact string length.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `b` has a length of 3, `b[4]` is out of bounds, and typically, such an access would raise an `IndexError` if not handled. However, based on the precondition and the format required, we need to describe the output as per the given conditions.

Given the constraints and the precondition, the output will be an `IndexError` because `b[4]` is out of bounds.

Output: **IndexError: string index out of range**
