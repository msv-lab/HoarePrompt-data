Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` and `b` are strings (though these won't change within the loop).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `f` is 0 (though this won't change within the loop).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs for each index `i` in the range from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The length of `a` remains the same as it was at the start of the loop.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `f` remains 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` and `b` are strings, `i` is 2, `f` is 0**
