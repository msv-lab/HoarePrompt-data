Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `len(a)`.
2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of characters with at least one character.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `f` is 1 if `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, otherwise `f` is 0.
   - If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `a[i]` is set to the previous value of `b[i]` and `b[i]` is set to the previous value of `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, after incrementing, `i` will be 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `len(a)`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(a)` for the loop to execute again.

Given these points, we need to update the state such that `i` is 1 and `i` is still less than `len(a)`.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to 1.
   - `f` remains the same unless the condition inside the loop changes it, but since we are only looking at the state at the start of the next iteration, `f` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `a` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is 1, and `f` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.**
