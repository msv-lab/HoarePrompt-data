Postcondition: **`a[i]` and `b[i]` are elements from arrays `a` and `b` respectively. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `a[i]` is now equal to the original value of `b[i]` and `b[i]` is now equal to the original value of `a[i]`, `f` retains its original value, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` keep their original values, `f` retains its original value, and `i` remains unchanged.**
