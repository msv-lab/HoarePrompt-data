Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and two binary strings `a_{1}` and `a_{2}`. It constructs a new string `s` based on certain conditions involving characters from `a_{1}` and `a_{2}`. Then, it checks for a specific substring pattern within `a_{2}` and calculates a length `t` based on the match. Finally, it prints the string `s` and the integer `t`.**
