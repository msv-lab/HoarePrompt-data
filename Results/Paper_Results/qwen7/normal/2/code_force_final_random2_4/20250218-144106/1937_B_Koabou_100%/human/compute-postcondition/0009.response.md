Output State: `a` is a list containing five elements, where the first two elements are strings from the initial input, the third element is a new string from the second input, the fourth element is another new string from the third input, and the fifth element is the final input from the fourth iteration of the loop.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which is 2 times in this case), the list `a` will contain four inputs provided through the `input()` function, resulting in a list with five elements in total.
