You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and two binary strings `a_{1}` and `a_{2}`. It constructs a new string `s` based on certain conditions involving characters from `a_{1}` and `a_{2}`. Then, it checks for a specific substring pattern within `a_{2}` and calculates a length `t` based on the match. Finally, it prints the string `s` and the integer `t`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Path Selection Logic**: The program attempts to select a path based on specific conditions (`a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` and `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`). However, this logic is too restrictive and does not cover all possible paths that could lead to the lexicographically smallest string. For instance, consider the following input:
   ```
   2
   01
   10
   ```
   The correct lexicographically smallest string should be `00`, but the program would incorrectly choose the path leading to `10`.

2. **Handling of Different Paths**: The program does not account for all possible paths that can yield the lexicographically smallest string. It only considers the first occurrence of a transition from '0' to '1' or vice versa, which might not always result in the lexicographically smallest string. For example, in the following input:
   ```
   2
   11
   00
   ```
   The correct lexicographically smallest string should be `00`, but the program would incorrectly choose the path leading to `11`.

3. **Counting Paths**: The program also fails to correctly count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. It only checks for a single path after the initial selection, which is insufficient.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
