You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are provided, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list containing five elements, where the first two elements are strings from the initial input, the third element is a new string from the second input, the fourth element is another new string from the third input, and the fifth element is the final input from the fourth iteration of the loop.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which is 2 times in this case), the list `a` will contain four inputs provided through the `input()` function, resulting in a list with five elements in total.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0

        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]

    #State: Output State: `a` is a list containing ['input1', 'input2', 'input3', 'input4'], `x` is 3, `y` is 3, `i` is 3, `n` is 4, and `s` is 'input1input21'.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `n` will be 4 (since the loop runs from `i` in `range(n - 1)`), and the loop has executed three times as described in the previous states. The conditions inside the loop did not change `x` and `y` further after the third iteration, so they remain at `x` is 3 and `y` is 3. The variable `i` reaches 3, which is the last index in the range. The string `s` is constructed as 'input1input21' based on the logic provided in the third iteration's description.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 4, `i` is 4, `t` is 1, `a` is a list of lists where the second sublist contains at least 4 elements, `s` is a string 'input1input21'.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i` starting at 3 up to but not including `y` which is 3), the value of `i` reaches 4 without finding a match for the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]`. Therefore, the variable `t` remains 1, and the values of `x`, `i`, `a`, and `s` do not change from their last known state after the third iteration.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: input1input21
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Path Selection Logic**: The program attempts to select a path based on specific conditions (`a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` and `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`). However, this logic is too restrictive and does not cover all possible paths that could lead to the lexicographically smallest string. For instance, consider the following input:
   ```
   2
   01
   10
   ```
   The correct lexicographically smallest string should be `00`, but the program would incorrectly choose the path leading to `10`.

2. **Handling of Different Paths**: The program does not account for all possible paths that can yield the lexicographically smallest string. It only considers the first occurrence of a transition from '0' to '1' or vice versa, which might not always result in the lexicographically smallest string. For example, in the following input:
   ```
   2
   11
   00
   ```
   The correct lexicographically smallest string should be `00`, but the program would incorrectly choose the path leading to `11`.

3. **Counting Paths**: The program also fails to correctly count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. It only checks for a single path after the initial selection, which is insufficient.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
