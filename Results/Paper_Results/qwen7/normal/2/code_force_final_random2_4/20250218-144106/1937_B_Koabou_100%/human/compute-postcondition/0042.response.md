Postcondition: `a` is a list containing ['input1', 'input2', 'input3', 'input4'], `x` is 3, `y` is 3, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and if `a[0][i + 1]` equals '1' and `a[1][i]` equals '0', then the values of `x`, `y`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
