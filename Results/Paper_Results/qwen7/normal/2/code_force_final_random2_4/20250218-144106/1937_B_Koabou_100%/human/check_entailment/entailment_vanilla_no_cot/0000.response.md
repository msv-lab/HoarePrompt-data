Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Path Selection Logic**: The logic in `func_1` for determining the lexicographically smallest path is flawed. Specifically, the code tries to find a specific pattern in the grid to construct the path, which doesn't guarantee the lexicographically smallest path. For example, it checks for a specific transition from '1' to '0' or vice versa, but this approach may miss the optimal path.

2. **Incomplete Path Construction**: The code constructs the path `s` based on certain conditions, but it does not handle all possible scenarios to ensure the lexicographically smallest path is found. It also does not account for all possible paths that could lead to the smallest string.

3. **Incorrect Counting of Paths**: The count of paths (`t`) is calculated based on a specific pattern match, which might not reflect the actual number of paths that produce the lexicographically smallest string.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to use dynamic programming to keep track of the lexicographically smallest path and the number of such paths. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = [input() for _ in range(2)]
    
    # Initialize DP tables
    dp_str = [''] * (n + 1)
    dp_count = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp_str[0] = '0'
    dp_count[0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp_str[i] = '1' + dp_str[i-1]
        dp_count[i] = dp_count[i-1]
        
        if a[0][i-1] == '0':
            dp_str[i] = min(dp_str[i], '0' + dp_str[i-1])
            dp_count[i] += dp_count[i-1]
            
        if a[1][i-1] == '0':
            dp_str[i] = min(dp_str[i], '0' + dp_str[i-1])
            dp_count[i] += dp_count[i-1]
    
    print(dp_str[n])
    print(dp_count[n])

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to build the lexicographically smallest path and counts the number of such paths efficiently.
