Output State: **`a` is a list containing four elements, where the first two elements are strings from the initial input, the third element is a new string from the input, and the fourth element is the input from `input()`**.

The code `a.append(input())` appends the value of the input to the list `a`. Since `a` initially contains three elements (two strings from the initial input and one new string from the input), after appending the new input value, `a` will contain four elements: the first two strings from the initial input, the third string from the initial input, and the new input value.
