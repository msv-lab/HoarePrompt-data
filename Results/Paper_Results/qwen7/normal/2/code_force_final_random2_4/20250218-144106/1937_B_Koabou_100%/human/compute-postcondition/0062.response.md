Postcondition: `x` is 4, `i` is 4, `t` is 1, `a` is a list of lists where the second sublist contains at least 4 elements, `s` is a string, and if `a[1][i:x]` equals `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no change occurs to the variables.
