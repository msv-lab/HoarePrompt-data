Postcondition: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `a` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` remains the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `k` still remains the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.
