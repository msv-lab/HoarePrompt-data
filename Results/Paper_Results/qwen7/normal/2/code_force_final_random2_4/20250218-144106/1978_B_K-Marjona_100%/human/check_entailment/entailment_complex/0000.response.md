Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- The variable `k` is calculated as the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. This is correct because `k` represents the number of buns sold at the modified price.
- The program then checks if `b` is less than or equal to `a`. If true, it calculates the profit as `a * n`, which means all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, it calculates the profit using the formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`. This formula accounts for the reduced price of the first `k` buns and the usual price of the remaining `n - k` buns.
- The program correctly handles all given examples and edge cases, such as when `b` is less than or equal to `a`, and when `b` is much larger than `a`.

Given the analysis, the program logic matches the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
