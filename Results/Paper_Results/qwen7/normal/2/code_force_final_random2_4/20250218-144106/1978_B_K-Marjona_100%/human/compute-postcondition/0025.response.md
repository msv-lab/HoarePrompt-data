Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). It calculates and prints the result based on the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) for each test case. Specifically, it finds the minimum value between \( n \) and \( b - a \) and uses it to compute and print either \( a \times n \) or \( b \times k - k \times (k - 1) / 2 + (n - k) \times a \), depending on whether \( b \) is less than or equal to \( a \) or not. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the final values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) corresponding to the last input test case, and \( k \) being the minimum value between the final \( n \) and \( b - a \).**
