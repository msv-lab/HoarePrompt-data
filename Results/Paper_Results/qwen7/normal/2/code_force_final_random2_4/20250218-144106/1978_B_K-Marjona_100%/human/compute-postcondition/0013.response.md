Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `a` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `b` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `k`**:
   - `k` is calculated as `min(n, b - a)`.
   - This means `k` takes the smaller value between `n` and `b - a`.

4. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `b * k`: This term represents `b` multiplied by `k`.
   - `- k * (k - 1) // 2`: This term calculates the sum of the first `k-1` integers (which is \(\frac{k(k-1)}{2}\)), but with a negative sign.
   - `(n - k) * a`: This term represents `a` multiplied by the difference between `n` and `k`.

5. **Final Expression**:
   - Combining these parts, the expression becomes:
     \[
     b \cdot k - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
     \]

6. **Output Description**:
   - The expression evaluates to a specific numerical value based on the input values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`.
   - Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we express the output in terms of these variables and `k`.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the expression evaluated with the given values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`.

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a**
