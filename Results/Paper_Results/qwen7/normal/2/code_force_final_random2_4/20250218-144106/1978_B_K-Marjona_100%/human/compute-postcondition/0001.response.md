Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^4**.

The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since the input is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), and the input is split into three parts, each of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be an integer within the same range. The initial state of `n` being a positive integer within the specified range is now distributed among `n`, `a`, and `b`.
