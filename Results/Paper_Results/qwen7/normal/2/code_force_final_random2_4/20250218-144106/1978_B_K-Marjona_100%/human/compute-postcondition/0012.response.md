Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `a` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `b` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

After the user inputs the values for `n`, `a`, and `b`, the value of `k` is calculated as `min(n, b - a)`.

The print statement `print(a * n)` will output the product of `a` and `n`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not specified but are known to be within the given ranges, the output will be the product of these two values.

Output: **a * n (where a and n are the inputted integers between 1 and 10^4)**
