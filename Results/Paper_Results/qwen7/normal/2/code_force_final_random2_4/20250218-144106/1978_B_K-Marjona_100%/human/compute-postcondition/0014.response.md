Postcondition: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers between 1 and \(10^4\). `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. After the if-else block executes, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers inputted by the user, and `k` is recalculated as `min(n, b - a)`. If `b <= a`, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is updated to the minimum value between the new `n` and `b - a`.**
