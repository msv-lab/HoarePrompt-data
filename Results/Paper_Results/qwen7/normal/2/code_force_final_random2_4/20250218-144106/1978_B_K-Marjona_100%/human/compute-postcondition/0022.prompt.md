Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    k = min(n, b - a)
    if b <= a:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `a` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` remains the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `k` still remains the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers between 1 and \(10^4\). `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. After the if-else block executes, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers inputted by the user, and `k` is recalculated as `min(n, b - a)`. If `b <= a`, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is updated to the minimum value between the new `n` and `b - a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b <= a`, no changes are made to `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `k` as well.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
