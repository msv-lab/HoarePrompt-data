### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling \( n \) buns.
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price of \( b - i + 1 \) coins for the \( i \)-th bun.
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \) coins each.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It calculates \( k \) as the minimum of \( n \) and \( b - a \).
   - If \( b \leq a \), it prints \( a \times n \) (since no bun should be sold at a lower price).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula \( b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).

3. **Checking the Formula:**
   - The term \( b \times k \) represents the total revenue from the first \( k \) buns.
   - The term \( -\frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \) accounts for the decreasing price of each subsequent bun.
   - The term \( (n - k) \times a \) represents the total revenue from the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When \( b \leq a \), the formula simplifies to \( a \times n \), which is correct.
   - When \( b > a \), the formula correctly accounts for the decreasing price and the usual price.

5. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the formula with the provided examples:
     - **Example 1:** \( n = 4 \), \( a = 4 \), \( b = 5 \)
       - \( k = \min(4, 5 - 4) = 1 \)
       - Profit = \( 5 \times 1 - \frac{1 \times 0}{2} + (4 - 1) \times 4 = 5 + 12 = 17 \)
     - **Example 2:** \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
       - \( k = \min(5, 9 - 5) = 5 \)
       - Profit = \( 9 \times 5 - \frac{5 \times 4}{2} + (5 - 5) \times 5 = 45 - 10 + 0 = 35 \)
     - **Example 3:** \( n = 10 \), \( a = 10 \), \( b = 5 \)
       - \( k = \min(10, 5 - 10) = 0 \)
       - Profit = \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \)

6. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the function, including the calculation of \( k \) and the profit formula.
   - The function processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each test case.
