Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `a` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `b` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `b > a`.
- `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

Let's break down the expression `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`:

1. **Calculate `k`:**
   - `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.
   - Since both `n` and `b - a` are positive integers, `k` will be one of these two values.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `b * k`: This term multiplies `b` by `k`.
   - `k * (k - 1) // 2`: This term calculates the sum of the first `k-1` integers, which is \(\frac{k(k-1)}{2}\).
   - `(n - k) * a`: This term multiplies `a` by the difference between `n` and `k`.

Combining these, the expression simplifies to:
\[ b * k - \frac{k(k-1)}{2} + (n - k) * a \]

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` are not specified, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, we can describe the expression in terms of the variables.

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where b, n, a, and k are as described in the initial state)**
