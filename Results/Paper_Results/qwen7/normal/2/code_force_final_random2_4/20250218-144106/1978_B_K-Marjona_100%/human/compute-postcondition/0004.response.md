Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `a` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `b` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.
- The current value of `b` is less than or equal to `a`.

We need to determine the value of `a * n` that will be printed.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Since `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the expression `b - a` will result in a non-positive number (either zero or negative).
2. Therefore, the minimum value between `n` and `b - a` will be `b - a` because it is non-positive and thus smaller than any positive value of `n`.
3. Hence, `k = b - a`.

However, the value of `k` does not affect the calculation of `a * n` directly. The print statement only depends on the values of `a` and `n`.

Since `a` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), the product `a * n` will be an integer between 1 and \(10^8\).

Output: **a * n (where a is an integer between 1 and 10^4 and n is an integer between 1 and 10^4)**
