Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).
- `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `h` is adjusted to be within the range of 1 to 12.
- `m` is an input integer.

The key transformations applied to these variables are:
- If `h` is 0, it is set to 12.
- If `h` is greater than 12, `day` changes to 'PM'.
- Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This statement formats `h` and `m` to two-digit strings with leading zeros if necessary and concatenates them with the `day` value.

Since the exact values of `h` and `m` are not specified, we need to consider the possible ranges and transformations:
- `h` is adjusted to be within 1 to 12.
- `m` is an integer, but no specific value is given.

Given the transformations, let's assume a possible scenario where `h` is 9 and `m` is 30 (these are just example values within the valid range):

- Since `h` is 9 (which is between 1 and 12), `day` would remain 'AM'.
- The formatted time would be '09:30' (since `h` is already a single digit, it gets padded with a leading zero).

Thus, the print statement would output:
Output: **09:30 AM**
