Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `h` is 12, `m` is an integer**

Explanation: The code sets the value of `h` to 12, which overrides the previous value of `h` obtained from the input split by ':'. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
