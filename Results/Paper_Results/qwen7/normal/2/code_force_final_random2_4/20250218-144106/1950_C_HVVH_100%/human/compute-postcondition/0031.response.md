Output State: **`day` is 'AM', `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code sets `day` to 'AM', which changes its value. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `h`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
