Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1440, `day` is 'PM', `n` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12 decreased by 12, `m` is an integer**.

Explanation: The code simply changes the value of `day` to 'PM'. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1440, `n` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12 decreased by 12, and `m` is an integer are still valid.
