Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(n):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `_` (a dummy variable) and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as follows:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).
   - `day` is 'AM'.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the value of `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the value of `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The values of `t` and `day` do not affect the loop's execution and can remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0**
