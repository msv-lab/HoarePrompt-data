Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is now `h - 12`, `m` is an input integer, and `h` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `day` from 'AM' to 'PM'. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
