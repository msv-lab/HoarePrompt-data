Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is now `h - 12`, `m` is an input integer, and \(h\) is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `h = h - 12` subtracts 12 from the current value of `h`. Since `h` was originally greater than 12, the new value of `h` is now `h - 12`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
