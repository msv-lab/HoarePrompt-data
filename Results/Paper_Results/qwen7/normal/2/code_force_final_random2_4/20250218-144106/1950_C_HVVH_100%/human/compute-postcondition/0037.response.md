Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer. If `h` is 0, then `day` is 'AM', `h` is 12, and `m` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is decreased by 12, and `day` changes to 'PM'.**
