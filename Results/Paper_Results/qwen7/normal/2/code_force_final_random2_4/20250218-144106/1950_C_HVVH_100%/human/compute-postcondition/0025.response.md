Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\)
- `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `h` is adjusted to be within the range of 1 to 12
- `m` is an input integer
- If `h` is 0, then `h` is set to 12
- If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` changes to 'PM', otherwise `day` remains 'AM'

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs `n` times.
- The loop variable `_` is used, indicating that the loop does not depend on an index or a specific variable value.
- The loop itself does not change the values of `t`, `day`, `h`, or `m`.
- The only state that could potentially change is `n`, but since the loop is defined as `range(n)`, `n` itself does not change within the loop.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\)
   - `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `h` is adjusted to be within the range of 1 to 12
   - `m` is an input integer
   - If `h` is 0, then `h` is set to 12
   - If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` changes to 'PM', otherwise `day` remains 'AM'

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `n` times.
   - Since the loop does not change the values of `t`, `day`, `h`, or `m`, these states remain the same.
   - The only state that could change is `n`, but `n` is fixed at the beginning of the loop and does not change during its execution.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - All other states (`t`, `day`, `h`, `m`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
Since the loop does not change any of the states except `n`, and `n` remains greater than 0, the states at the start of the next iteration are the same as the initial states.

### Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is adjusted to be within the range of 1 to 12, and `m` is an input integer. If `h` is 0, then `h` is set to 12. If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` changes to 'PM', otherwise `day` remains 'AM'**.
