Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).
- `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `h` is an integer between 1 and 12.
- `m` is an integer.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

Let's break down the values that will be printed:

1. **`h`**: This is an integer between 1 and 12.
2. **`m`**: This is an integer.
3. **`day`**: This is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

The format specifier `{h:02d}:{m:02d}` ensures that both `h` and `m` are printed as two-digit numbers, padding with a leading zero if necessary.

Given these conditions, the output will be a time in the format `HH:MM` followed by either 'AM' or 'PM'. 

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}**
