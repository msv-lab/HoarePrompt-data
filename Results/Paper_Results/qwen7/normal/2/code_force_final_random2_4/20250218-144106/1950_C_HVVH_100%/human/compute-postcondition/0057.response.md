Functionality: **The function processes a series of time inputs in the format "hh:mm", converting them to a 12-hour clock format with AM/PM notation. It prints each converted time and the corresponding AM/PM designation. After processing all inputs, it sets the loop counter `n` to 0 and leaves the initial values of `t`, `h`, and `m` unchanged, while updating `day` and `h` based on the input times.**
