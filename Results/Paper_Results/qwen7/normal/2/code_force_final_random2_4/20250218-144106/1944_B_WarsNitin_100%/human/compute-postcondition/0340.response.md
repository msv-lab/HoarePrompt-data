Output State: **`k` is -2, `req` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is 4, `ans2` contains the element `c[4]`.**

The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[4]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 4, `ans2` will now contain the element at index 4 of the list `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
