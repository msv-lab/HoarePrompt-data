Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or -2, and `ans2` contains the elements `[c[3], c[3]]`. If `c[3]` is equal to `c[2]`, then `k` becomes 0 after breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[3]` is not equal to `c[2]`, then `k` remains either 0 or -2.
