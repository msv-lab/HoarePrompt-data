Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` equals 0, and `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 1, `ans1` will now contain the value of `b[1]`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
