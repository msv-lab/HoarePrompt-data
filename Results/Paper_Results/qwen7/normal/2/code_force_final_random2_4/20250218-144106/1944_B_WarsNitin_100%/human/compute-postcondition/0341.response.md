Output State: **`k` is -2, `req` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is 4, `ans2` contains the element `c[4]` and appends `c[4]` to itself.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[4]` (which is already in `ans2`) to `ans2`. Since `ans2` already contains `c[4]`, appending it again does not change its content except for the fact that it now has two occurrences of `c[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
