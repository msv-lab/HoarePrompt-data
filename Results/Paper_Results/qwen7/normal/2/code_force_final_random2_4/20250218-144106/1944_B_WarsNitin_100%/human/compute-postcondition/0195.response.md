Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - From the given state, `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will start when `i` is 1 and continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is initially `n-1`, the loop will not execute because `i` is not within the range `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - To make the loop execute, `i` needs to be set to `1` and `n` must be greater than `1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to `1` and `n` to be greater than `1`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
