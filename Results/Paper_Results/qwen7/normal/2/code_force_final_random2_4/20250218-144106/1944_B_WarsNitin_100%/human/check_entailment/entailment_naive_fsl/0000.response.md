Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` are equal. Here's an example to illustrate this:

Consider the following input:
```
4 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```

The program outputs:
```
5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4
```

Let's calculate the XOR values:
- XOR of `l`: \(5 \oplus 1 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 = 2\)
- XOR of `r`: \(6 \oplus 4 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 4\)

Clearly, the XOR values are not equal, which violates the problem requirement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
