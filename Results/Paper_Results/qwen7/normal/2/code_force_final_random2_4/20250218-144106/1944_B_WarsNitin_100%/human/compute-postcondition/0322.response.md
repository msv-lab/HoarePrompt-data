Output State: **`k` is 0, `req` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is 2, `ans2` contains the element `c[2]` (which is equal to `c[1]`).**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, `c[i]` is equal to `c[2]`, which is also equal to `c[1]` according to the precondition. Therefore, `ans2` now contains the element `c[2]` (or equivalently `c[1]`). All other variables remain unchanged.
