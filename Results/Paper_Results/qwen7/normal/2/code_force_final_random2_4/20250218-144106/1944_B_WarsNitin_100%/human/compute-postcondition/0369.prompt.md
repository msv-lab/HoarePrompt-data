Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `k` is -2n, `req` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is n+1, and `ans2` contains the elements `c[3]` to `c[n+1]` each repeated twice.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. For each iteration, if `k` is non-zero, it checks if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i-1]`. If they are equal, it appends `c[i]` twice to `ans2` and decreases `k` by 2. This process continues until `k` becomes zero or the loop reaches its end. After `n-1` iterations, `k` will be `-2n` (since `k` starts as `req` and is decreased by 2 for each match found). The variable `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` at the start of each iteration. `ans2` will contain every element from `c[3]` to `c[n]` each repeated twice, assuming there were enough matches to fill `ans2` up to `n+1` elements.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is an integer - 1; `ans1` has the element `l[i]` appended to it; `ans2` has the element `l[i]` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is 0, `ans1` has the element `l[0]` appended to it, `ans2` has the elements `l[0]` and `l[1]` appended to it, and `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is -1, `ans1` has the element `l[0]` and `l[3]` appended to it, `ans2` has the elements `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[3]` appended to it, and `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
