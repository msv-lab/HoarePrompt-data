Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` equals 0, and `ans1` contains the element `b[2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans1` now includes the element `b[2]`. The other variables (`n` and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
