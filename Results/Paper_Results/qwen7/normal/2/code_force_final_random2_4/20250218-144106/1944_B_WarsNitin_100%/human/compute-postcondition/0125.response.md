Output State: **i is -1, k is -len(l) - 3, ans1 contains all elements from l appended len(l) times, ans2 contains all elements from l appended 2 * len(l) times.**

Explanation: The loop continues until `k` reaches 0. Given that `k` starts at -2 and increments by -1 each iteration (since `k -= 1`), it will take `len(l) + 2` iterations for `k` to reach 0. Since the loop runs for all indices in `range(len(l))`, `i` will become `-1` after all iterations. `ans1` appends each element of `l` once per iteration, so it will contain all elements of `l` appended `len(l)` times. Similarly, `ans2` appends each element of `l` twice per iteration, so it will contain all elements of `l` appended `2 * len(l)` times.
