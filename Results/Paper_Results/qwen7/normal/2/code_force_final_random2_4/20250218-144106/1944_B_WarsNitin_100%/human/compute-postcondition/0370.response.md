Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is `-2n`
- `req` remains the same (its value is not specified, so it will be printed as is)
- `ans1` contains duplicate elements (the exact elements are not specified, so they will be printed as is)
- `l` is empty (it will be printed as an empty list `[]`)
- `i` is `n+1`
- `ans2` contains the elements `c[3]` to `c[n+1]` each repeated twice (the exact elements are not specified, so they will be printed as is)

The `print(*ans1)` statement will print the elements of `ans1` separated by spaces. Since `ans1` contains duplicate elements, those duplicates will be printed accordingly.

Output: **what is printed [the elements of ans1 separated by spaces]**
