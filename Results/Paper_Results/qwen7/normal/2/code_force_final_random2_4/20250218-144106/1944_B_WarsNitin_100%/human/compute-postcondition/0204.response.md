Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` appended, and the current value of `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`.**

The code `k -= 2` decrements the value of `k` by 2. Initially, `k` was 0, so after the operation, `k` becomes -2. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans2`, and `c[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
