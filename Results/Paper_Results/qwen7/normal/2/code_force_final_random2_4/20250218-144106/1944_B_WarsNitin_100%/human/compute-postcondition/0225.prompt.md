Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `k` is `req`, `n` is an input integer, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, and `c` is sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is a list containing all repeated elements in `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` (if any), `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing all elements in `b` from index `n-1` to the end that do not equal their preceding element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` equals 0, and `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` appended. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is set to -2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or -2, and `ans2` contains the values of `c[1]` and `c[2]` appended. If `c[2]` equals `c[1]`, `k` remains -4; otherwise, `k` becomes 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or -2. If `c[3]` equals `c[2]`, then `k` becomes 0 (breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement). Otherwise, `k` remains -2. `ans2` contains the elements `[c[3], c[3]]` if `c[3]` equals `c[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
