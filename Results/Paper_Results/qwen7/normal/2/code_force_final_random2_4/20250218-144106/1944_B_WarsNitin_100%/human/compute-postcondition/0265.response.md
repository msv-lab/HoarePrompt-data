Postcondition: **`k` is an input integer, `i` is len(l) - 2, `q` is len(l) - 2, `t` is len(l) - 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `b` is a list containing the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, and `c` is sorted, `req` is `k`, `l` is a list with one element which is the smallest element from the first `n` elements of `a`. If `b[0] != b[1]`, `l` contains the smallest element from the first `n` elements of `a`.**
