Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans1` has the element `l[0]` appended to it, `ans2` has the elements `l[0]` and `l[1]` appended to it, and `i` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `k`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `i`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
