Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans1` now contains `b[2]`, `n` is the same as before, `k` is either -2 or 0, and `l` is either empty or contains the element `b[2]` if `b[2] != b[3]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` was initially 2, after executing this line, `i` is incremented to 3 (since lists are zero-indexed and we are appending `b[2]` which corresponds to the third element). The value of `b[2]` is added to `ans1`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged according to the initial conditions.
