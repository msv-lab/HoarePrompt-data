Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is equal to 0, and `ans1` contains the value of `b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i]` (which is `b[1]` since `i` is 1) to the list `ans1`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and the relationship between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` remain unchanged.
