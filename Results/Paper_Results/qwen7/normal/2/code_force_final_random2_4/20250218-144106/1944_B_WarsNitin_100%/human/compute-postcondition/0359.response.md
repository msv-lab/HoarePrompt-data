Output State: **`k` is an integer - 1; `ans1` has the element `l[0]` appended to it; `ans2` has the element `l[0]` appended to it; `i` is 1;**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `ans1` will have `l[0]` appended to it. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1 (though the increment is not explicitly shown in the code, it is implied by the context), making `i` equal to 1. The values of `k`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `i` are updated accordingly.
