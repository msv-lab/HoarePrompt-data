Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements.**

Explanation: The code `c = a[n:]` assigns to `c` a sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
