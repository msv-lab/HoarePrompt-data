Postcondition: `i` is -1, `k` is either -2 * len(a) - 6 or -2 * len(a) - 8, `n` is an input integer, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, and `c` is sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing `b[n - 1]` appended, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is either an empty list or `['b[0]']` depending on whether `b[0]` is defined and not equal to `b[1]`, and `b[n - 1]` is either appended to `l` or added to `ans1` based on the condition `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`.
