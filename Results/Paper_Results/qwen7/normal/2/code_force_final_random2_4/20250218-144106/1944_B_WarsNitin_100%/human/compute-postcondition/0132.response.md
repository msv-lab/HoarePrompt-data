Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is -len(a) - 3, `n` is an input integer, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements.**

Explanation: The code `c = a[n:]` creates a new sublist `c` from the list `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list. The values of `i`, `k`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The new sublist `c` contains the elements of `a` from index `n` to the last element of `a`.
