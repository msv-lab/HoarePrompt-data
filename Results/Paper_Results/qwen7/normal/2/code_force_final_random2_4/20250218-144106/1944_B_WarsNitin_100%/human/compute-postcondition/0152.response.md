Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Since no variables are modified by this statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
