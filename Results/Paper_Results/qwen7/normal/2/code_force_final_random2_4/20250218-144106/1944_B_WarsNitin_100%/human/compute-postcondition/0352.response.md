Output State: **`k` is an integer; `ans1` has the element `l[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `l[i]` to the list `ans1`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was before the operation, and it is still an integer. If `k` was equal to 0, it does not affect the appending operation. Therefore, the only change is that `ans1` now contains an additional element, which is `l[i]`.
