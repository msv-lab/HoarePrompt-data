State: **`k` is `req`, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 1 in the range function `range(1, n)`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range function `range(1, n)` will generate numbers from 1 to `n-1`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
- The other variables (`k`, `ans1`, and `l`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 1, `n` set to a value greater than 1, and the existing states of `k`, `ans1`, and `l` remain unchanged.
