Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 2
   - `k` equals 0

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n - 1`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be updated to `2` (since `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - The condition `n > 2` remains unchanged as it is an external condition not modified within the loop.

5. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is now 2
   - `n` is still greater than 2
   - `k` remains 0 (as it is not modified by the loop)

So, the final state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` equals 0**
