Output State: **`k` is -4, `req` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is 4, `ans2` contains the element `c[4]` and appends `c[4]` to itself.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2, changing its value from -2 to -4. The other variables (`req`, `ans1`, `l`, `i`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
