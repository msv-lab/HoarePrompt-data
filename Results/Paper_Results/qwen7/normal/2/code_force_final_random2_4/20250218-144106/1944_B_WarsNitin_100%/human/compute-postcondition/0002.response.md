Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The values of `t` and `q` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), and `q` remains 0. The values of `n` and `k` are set to the integers input by the user.
