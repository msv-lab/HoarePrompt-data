Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans1` now contains `b[2]` and `b[3]`, `n` is the same as before, `k` is either -2 or 0, and `l` is either empty or contains the element `b[2]` if `b[2] != b[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to `ans1`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans1` will append `b[3]`. Since `ans1` initially contained `b[2]`, after the execution, `ans1` will contain both `b[2]` and `b[3]`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
