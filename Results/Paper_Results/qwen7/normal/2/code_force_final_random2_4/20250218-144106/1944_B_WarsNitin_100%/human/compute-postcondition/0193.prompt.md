Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `i` is -1, `k` is either -2 * len(a) - 6 or -2 * len(a) - 8, `n` is an input integer, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, and `c` is sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing `b[n - 1]` appended, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is either an empty list or `['b[0]']` depending on whether `b[0]` is defined and not equal to `b[1]`, and `b[n - 1]` is either appended to `l` or added to `ans1` based on the condition `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is equal to 0, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `b[i]` is appended to `l`. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, then `i` is set to 2, `k` is set to -2, and `ans1` contains the value of `b[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and `k` is 0. If `b[2]` is equal to `b[1]`, then `k` becomes -2 and `ans1` contains the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`. If `b[2]` is not equal to `b[3]`, then the condition remains unchanged. If `b[2]` equals `b[3]`, then the condition also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3. If `b[3]` is equal to `b[2]`, then `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, `l` contains the element `b[3]`, and if `b[3]` is not equal to `b[4]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
