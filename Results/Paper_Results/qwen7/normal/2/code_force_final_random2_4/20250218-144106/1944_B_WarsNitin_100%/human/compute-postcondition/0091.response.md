Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is -2, and `ans2` now contains the elements `c[2]` and `c[3]`.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `k` is either -2 or 0 depending on the condition `c[2] == c[1]`.
- The code `k -= 2` subtracts 2 from `k`.
- If `k` was initially -2, it remains -2.
- If `k` was initially 0, it becomes -2.
- The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
