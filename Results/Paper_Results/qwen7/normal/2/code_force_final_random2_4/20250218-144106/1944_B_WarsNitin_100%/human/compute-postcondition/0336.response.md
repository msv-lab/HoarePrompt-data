Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is -2
   - `req` remains the same
   - `ans1` contains duplicate elements
   - `l` is empty
   - `i` is 3
   - If `c[3]` is equal to `c[2]`, then `ans2` contains two identical elements of `c[3]`. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `i`).
   - Therefore, `i` will be 4.
   - The value of `n` is not specified to change within the loop body, so it remains the same.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `k` remains -2
   - `req` remains the same
   - `ans1` remains containing duplicate elements
   - `l` remains empty
   - `i` changes to 4
   - The condition for `ans2` remains the same based on the value of `c[3]` and `c[2]`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`k` is -2, `req` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is 4, and if `c[3]` is equal to `c[2]`, then `ans2` contains two identical elements of `c[3]`. Otherwise, `ans2` remains unchanged.**
