You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    elif n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(n)
    elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(n - k + 1, 1)
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, it checks if n is less than k. If so, it prints 'NO'. If n equals k, it prints 'YES', 1, and n. If n is greater than k and k - 1 is less than n - k + 1, it prints 'YES', 2, n - k + 1, and 1. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Basic Cases**:
   - If `n < k`, Alice cannot buy `k` jewels, so the output is "NO".
   - If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if the price per jewel is `1`. So, the output is "YES" and the number of stalls is `1`.
3. **Intermediate Case**:
   - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it means Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from the first stall and then use the remaining coins to buy `1` jewel from another stall. The program correctly handles this case by setting the prices of the stalls accordingly.
4. **General Case**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it implies that it is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. However, the current implementation incorrectly prints "NO" without attempting to set up more than 2 stalls.

### Analysis:
- The program fails to handle cases where more than 2 stalls are needed to achieve the goal. For example, if `k` is significantly larger than `n`, the program should attempt to distribute the purchases across more stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
- The logic for handling the general case needs to be expanded to include scenarios where more than 2 stalls might be necessary.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios where more than 2 stalls are required to achieve the goal of making Alice buy exactly `k` jewels.

### Correctness:
**False**
