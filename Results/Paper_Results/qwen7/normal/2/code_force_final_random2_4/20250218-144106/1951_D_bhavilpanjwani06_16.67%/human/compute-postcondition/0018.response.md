Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any parameters itself but is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `t` within the range of 1 to 1000, and two positive integers `n` and `k` within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\). The function processes these inputs and returns outputs based on specific conditions related to `n`, `k`, and possibly `t`.
