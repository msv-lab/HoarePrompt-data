Output State: **`i` is 10, `k` must be at least 1024, `ans` is [1023, 1025, 2049], `tc` is 10, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `ans` with the values calculated based on the current value of `k` and `i`. Specifically, `k - (1 << i)` calculates to `1024 - (1 << 10) = 1024 - 1024 = 1023`, `k + 1` calculates to `1024 + 1 = 1025`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` calculates to `1024 + 1 + 1024 = 2049`. The values of `i`, `k`, `tc`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the code.
