Output State: `i` is 10, `k` must be at least 1024.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(1 \ll i + 1 \leq k\) holds true. Given that after 3 iterations `i` is 3 and `k` must be at least 8, we can deduce that each iteration doubles the value that `k` must be at least. Therefore, after 10 iterations, `i` would be 10 (since \(1 \ll 10 + 1 = 2^{10+1} = 1024\)), and `k` must be at least 1024 for the loop to continue. However, since the loop condition is checked and the loop will terminate when the condition no longer holds, `k` must be at least 1024 for the loop to complete its full iterations.
