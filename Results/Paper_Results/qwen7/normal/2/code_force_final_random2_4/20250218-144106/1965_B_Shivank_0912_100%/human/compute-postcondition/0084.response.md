Output: **1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 20** 

Explanation: 
- `j` is explicitly given as 19.
- `ans` is a list containing the values from 1 to 20, except for the value at index `j` (which is 19). Since `i` is not equal to `j`, the list `ans` will exclude the value at index 19.
- Therefore, the list `ans` will contain the numbers from 1 to 18 followed by 20.
- The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by a space.
