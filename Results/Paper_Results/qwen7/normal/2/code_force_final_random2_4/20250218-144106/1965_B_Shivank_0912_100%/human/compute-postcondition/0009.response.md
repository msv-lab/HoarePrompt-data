Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 8**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
