Output State: **`j` is 2, `20` is 20, and `ans` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4]**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << j)` appends to the list `ans` the value of `1` left-shifted by `j` bits. Given that `j` is 2, `1 << 2` equals `4`. Therefore, the list `ans` now contains `[1, 2, 4]`. The values of `j` and `20` remain unchanged.
