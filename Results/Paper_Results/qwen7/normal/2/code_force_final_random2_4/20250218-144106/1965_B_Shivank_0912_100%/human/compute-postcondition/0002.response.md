Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `t` and `tc` remain unchanged from their initial state.
