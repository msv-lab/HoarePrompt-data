Output State: **`j` is 1; `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and 2**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is initially 1, `1 << j` equals `1 << 1`, which is 2. So, the list `ans` now contains both 1 (initial value) and 2. Variables `j` and `ans` are updated accordingly.
