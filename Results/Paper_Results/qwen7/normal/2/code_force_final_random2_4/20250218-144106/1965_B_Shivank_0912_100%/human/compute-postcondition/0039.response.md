Output State: `i` is 10, `k` must be at least 1024.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(1 \ll i + 1 \leq k\) holds true. Given that the loop executes up to 3 times with `i` becoming 3 when `k` is at least 8, we can infer the relationship between `i` and `k`. Each iteration doubles the value that `1 << i + 1` checks against `k`. After 3 iterations, `i` is 3 and `k` must be at least \(2^4 = 16\). Continuing this pattern, after 10 iterations, `i` will be 10, and `k` must be at least \(2^{11} = 2048 / 2 = 1024\). Since the loop condition is met as long as \(1 << i + 1 \leq k\), and given that `k` must be at least 1024 for the loop to continue until `i` reaches its maximum possible value under the given condition, the final state after all iterations would have `i` being 10 and `k` being at least 1024.
