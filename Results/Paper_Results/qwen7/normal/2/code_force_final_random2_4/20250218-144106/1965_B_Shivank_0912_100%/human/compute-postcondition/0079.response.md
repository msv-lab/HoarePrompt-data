Output State: **`j` is 2; `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, 3, and 4.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 2, `1 << j` equals `1 << 2`, which is 4. Therefore, the list `ans` now contains the values 1, 2, 3, and 4. The value of `j` remains unchanged.
