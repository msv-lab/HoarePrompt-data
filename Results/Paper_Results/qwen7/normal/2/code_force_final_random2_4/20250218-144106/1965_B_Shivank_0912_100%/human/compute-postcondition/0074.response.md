Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(20)`. The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, and `ans` is a list containing the value 1.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 20.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value of 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

5. **Adjusting the States**: Since the only variable in the loop head is `j`, we need to update its value. The other variable `ans` is not part of the loop head and does not change based on the loop condition alone.

6. **New State**: After the first iteration, `j` will be 1. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value 1**
