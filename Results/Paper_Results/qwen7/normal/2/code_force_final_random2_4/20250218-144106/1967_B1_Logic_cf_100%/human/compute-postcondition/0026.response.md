Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `b` is greater than or equal to the maximum value of `b` after 3 iterations, which is 4.
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m)` is at least 4.
   - `ans` is the sum of the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to the final value of `b`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.
   - After 3 iterations, `b` is 4, so the loop will continue until `b` exceeds `min(n, m)`.
   - For each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` where `b` starts from 2 and increments by 1.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - Since `b` is 4 after 3 iterations, the loop will run for `b = 2, 3, 4`.
   - The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` will be evaluated for each `b`:
     - For `b = 2`: `(n + 2) // (2 * 2) = (n + 2) // 4`
     - For `b = 3`: `(n + 3) // (3 * 3) = (n + 3) // 9`
     - For `b = 4`: `(n + 4) // (4 * 4) = (n + 4) // 16`

4. **Summing Up the Values:**
   - `ans` will be the sum of these values:
     \[
     ans = (n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16
     \]

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the above expressions.

Given the conditions, the final output will be:
Output: **(n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16**
