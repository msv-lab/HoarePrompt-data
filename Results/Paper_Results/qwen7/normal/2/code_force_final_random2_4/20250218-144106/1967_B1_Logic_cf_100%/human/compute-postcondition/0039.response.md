Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for all `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m)`, inclusive.
- `b` is set to `min(n, m)`, and it must be at least 5.
- `n` and `m` are integers.

Given that `b` is set to `min(n, m)` and must be at least 5, let's assume the smallest possible value for `b` which is 5. This means both `n` and `m` must be at least 5 for the loop to start.

For `b = 5`:
- The expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) becomes \((n + 5) // (5 * 5)\).

Since `b` is only 5, the loop will only execute once, and the value of `ans` will be:
\[ ans = (n + 5) // (5 * 5) \]

Therefore, the print statement will output this value.

Output: **(n + 5) // (25)**
