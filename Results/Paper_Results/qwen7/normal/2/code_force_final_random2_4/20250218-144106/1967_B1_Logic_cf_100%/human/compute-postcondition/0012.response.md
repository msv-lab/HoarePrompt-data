Output State: **The final value of `ans` will be the sum of `n` and the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m)` inclusive.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `ans` will hold the sum of `n` and the integer division of `(n + b)` by `b * b` for each `b` starting from 2 up to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
