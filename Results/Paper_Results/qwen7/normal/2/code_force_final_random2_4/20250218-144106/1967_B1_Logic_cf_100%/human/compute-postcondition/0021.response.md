Output State: **`b` is 3, `n` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 2, `m` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 2, `ans` is `ans + (n + 3) // (3 * 3)`**.

Explanation: The initial value of `b` is 3, and `ans` is updated by adding `(n + 2) // (2 * 2)` to its current value. Then, `ans` is further updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)`, which simplifies to `(n + 3) // 9`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not directly involved in the operations that modify `ans`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated expression for `ans` and retains the conditions on `n` and `m`.
