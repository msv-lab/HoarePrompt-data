Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):
    [n, m] = input().split()
    [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
    ans = n
    for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
        ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The final value of `ans` will be the sum of `n` and the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m)` inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `b` is greater than or equal to the maximum value of `b` after 3 iterations (which is 4), `n` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 4, `m` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 4, `ans` is the sum of the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to the final value of `b`.

To break it down further:
- The loop runs as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.
- After 3 iterations, `b` is 4, so the loop will continue until `b` exceeds `min(n, m)`.
- For each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` where `b` starts from 2 and increments by 1.
- Therefore, `ans` will be the sum of `(n + 2) // 4`, `(n + 3) // 9`, `(n + 4) // 16`, and so on, up to the last valid `b` which is `min(n, m)`.

This means `ans` will contain the cumulative sum of these expressions for all valid `b` values from 2 up to the largest `b` where `b <= min(n, m)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `ans` is the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m)`, inclusive, `b` is `min(n, m)`, `n` is an integer, and `m` is an integer with the condition that `min(n, m)` must be at least 5.

In simpler terms, `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of expressions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` starting from 2 up to the smaller of `n` and `m`. The loop will continue until `b` reaches the minimum of `n` and `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
