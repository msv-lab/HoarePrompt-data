Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m, with specific constraints. For each test case, it returns either 'valid' if the conditions are met or an error message if the conditions are not satisfied.**

This means the function is expected to validate a series of test cases, each containing two integers n and m, ensuring they meet certain criteria (positive integers within specified ranges and total sum constraints). If the conditions are met, it returns 'valid'; otherwise, it returns an error message indicating the conditions were not satisfied.
