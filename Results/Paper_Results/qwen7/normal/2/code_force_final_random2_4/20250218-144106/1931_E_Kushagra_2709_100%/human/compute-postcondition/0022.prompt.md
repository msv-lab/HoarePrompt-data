You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9.
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        
        tot += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer with a length of at least 1, `i` is 0, `tot` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in `num`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be set to 0 because the loop decrements `i` from `len(num) - 1` until it finds a non-zero digit or reaches the beginning of the string. The variable `tot` will count the number of trailing zeros in the string `num`. This is because each time the loop encounters a '0', it increments `tot` by 1. Once a non-zero digit is encountered, the loop breaks, and `i` remains as the index of that non-zero digit.
    return tot
    #`The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the integer 'num'`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter num, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the integer 'num'.

```

Return Postconditions: `The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the integer 'num'`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
