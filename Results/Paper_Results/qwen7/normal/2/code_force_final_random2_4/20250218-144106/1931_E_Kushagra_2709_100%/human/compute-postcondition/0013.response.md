Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `num` is a string representation of an integer with a length of at least 1.
   - `i` is `len(num) - 2`.
   - `tot` is 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(num) - 1` down to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `len(num) - 1` and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` is currently `len(num) - 2`, the next value of `i` will be `len(num) - 3`.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that changes in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to update `i` to `len(num) - 3`. The other variables (`num` and `tot`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

6. **Formulate the new state**: The new state should reflect the updated value of `i` while keeping the other variables as they were.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer with a length of at least 1, `i` is len(num) - 3, `tot` is 2**
