Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer with a length of at least 1, and `i` is `len(num) - 1`; `tot` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `tot` is incremented by 1, starting from an initial state where `num` is a string representation of an integer with a length of at least 1, and `i` is `len(num) - 1`. The conditions specified for `num[i]` do not affect the value of `tot`, which is now 1.
