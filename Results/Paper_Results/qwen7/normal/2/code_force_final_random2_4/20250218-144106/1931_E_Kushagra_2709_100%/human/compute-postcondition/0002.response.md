Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.
   - The loop also references the variable `num`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `len(num) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.
   - This means `i` will take values from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = len(num) - 1`, we need to set `i` to this initial value.

4. **Consider the State of `num`:**
   - The variable `num` is a string representation of an integer such that `1 <= num <= 10^9`.
   - The length of `num` (denoted as `len(num)`) must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Combine the Information:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to `len(num) - 1`.
   - We also need to ensure that `len(num)` is at least 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to `len(num) - 1`.
- `num` must be a string representation of an integer such that its length is at least 1.

Putting it all together, the final state is:

**State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that its length is at least 1, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
