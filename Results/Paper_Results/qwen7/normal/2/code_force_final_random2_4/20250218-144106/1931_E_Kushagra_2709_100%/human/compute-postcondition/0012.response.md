Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer with a length of at least 1, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `tot` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `tot += 1` increments the value of `tot` by 1. Initially, `tot` is 1, so after executing this line, `tot` becomes 2. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
