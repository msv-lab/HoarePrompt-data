Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing three elements `(1 << i) - 1`, `0`, and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is either the final value it reached after being doubled as many times as possible without exceeding `k`, or 2 if doubling did not occur.**

Explanation: The line `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends `0` to the list `ans` until its length equals `n`. Initially, `ans` contains two elements: `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`. After appending `0` to `ans` `n - 2` times, the new length of `ans` becomes `n`, and it now contains three elements: `(1 << i) - 1`, `0`, and `k - sum(ans)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
