Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input string.
2. `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer.
3. `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer.
4. The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`.

Since the exact input string is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`. However, based on the precondition, `k` is the second element of the list `l1` after it has been split and converted to an integer.

Output: **k (where k is the second element of the list l1 converted to an integer)**
