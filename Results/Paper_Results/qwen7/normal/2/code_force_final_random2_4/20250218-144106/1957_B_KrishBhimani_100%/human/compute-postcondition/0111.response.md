Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, if \( n = 1 \), it prints \( k \) directly. Otherwise, it calculates a list \( ans \) containing two elements: \((1 << i) - 1\) and \( k - \text{sum}(ans) \), where \( i \) is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \). The list \( ans \) is then extended with zeros to match the length \( n \). The function prints the final list \( ans \) for each test case.**
