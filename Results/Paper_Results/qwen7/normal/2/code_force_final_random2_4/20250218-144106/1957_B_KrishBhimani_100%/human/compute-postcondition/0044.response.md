Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `arr`. This does not affect the values of `l1`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
