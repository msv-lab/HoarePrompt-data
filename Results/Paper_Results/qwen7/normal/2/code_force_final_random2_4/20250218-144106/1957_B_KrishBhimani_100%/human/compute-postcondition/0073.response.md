Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `_` and the value of `int(input())`. This means that the loop will run as many times as the integer value provided by the user.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer.
   - `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer.

3. **Understand the loop body**:
   - If `n` equals 1, the function does not change the values of `i`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `temp`, and adds zeros to `ans` to match the length of `n`.
   - Otherwise, `i` is either 0 or 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by the integer value provided by `int(input())`, the only thing that changes is the number of iterations left.
   - The variables `l1`, `n`, and `k` remain the same unless they are updated within the loop body, but since the problem states that these variables are not changed, they stay the same.
   - The loop will run one more time, so the number of iterations left is reduced by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, and the number of iterations left is reduced by 1.**

However, since the exact number of iterations left is not specified in the problem statement, we can represent it as a general form:

**State: `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.**

To fit the required format:

**State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`**.
