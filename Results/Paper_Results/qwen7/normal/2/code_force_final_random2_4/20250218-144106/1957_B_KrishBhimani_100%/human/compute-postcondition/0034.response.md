Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `(1 << i) - 1`, and `temp` is either the final value it reached after being doubled as many times as possible without exceeding `k`, or 2 if doubling did not occur (meaning `temp * 2 >= k` from the start).**

Explanation: The line `ans.append((1 << i) - 1)` appends the value of `(1 << i) - 1` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is either 0 or 1, the expression `(1 << i) - 1` evaluates to 0 when `i` is 0, and 1 when `i` is 1. Since `i` is 0 or 1, `ans` will contain either `[0]` or `[1]`. The other variables (`i`, `l1`, `n`, `arr`, `temp`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
