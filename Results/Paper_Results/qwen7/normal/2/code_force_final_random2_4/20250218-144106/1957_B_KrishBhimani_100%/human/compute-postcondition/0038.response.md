Postcondition: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`. If `n` equals 1, then `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`. Otherwise, `i` is either 0 or 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing three elements `(1 << i) - 1`, `0`, and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is either the final value it reached after being doubled as many times as possible without exceeding `k`, or 2 if doubling did not occur.**
