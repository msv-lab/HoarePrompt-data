Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The line `k0 = k` assigns the value of `k` to `k0`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the values of `l1`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and `k0` is now equal to `k`.
