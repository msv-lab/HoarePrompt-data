Postcondition: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`. If `n == 1`, the function does not change `k0`, `arr`, `i`, `ans`, and `temp`. Otherwise, `k0` equals `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is the final value determined by the loop (either the number of times the loop executed or one less than that), `ans` is a list containing `(1 << i) - 1`, and `temp` is 2 if `temp * 2 >= k` after the last iteration of the loop, otherwise `temp` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`; `ans` now contains `k - sum(ans)`, and `ans` is extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`.**
