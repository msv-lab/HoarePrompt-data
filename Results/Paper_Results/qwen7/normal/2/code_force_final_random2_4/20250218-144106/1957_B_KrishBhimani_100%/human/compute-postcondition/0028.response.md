Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is now `temp * 2` depending on whether `temp * 2 < k` was true or false. If `temp * 2 < k` was true, `temp` is doubled, otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited.**

This means that the value of `temp` has been updated to `temp * 2` based on the condition `temp * 2 < k`. If the condition was true, `temp` is doubled; otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited without further changes to `temp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
