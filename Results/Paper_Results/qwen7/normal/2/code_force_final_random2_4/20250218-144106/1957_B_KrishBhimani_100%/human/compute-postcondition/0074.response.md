Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `l1 = input().split()` takes a new input string, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to `l1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are elements of `l1`. The number of iterations left is updated to `int(input()) - 1` because the current line of input is consumed.
