Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `idx1` remains unchanged, `idx2` remains unchanged, `p1` remains unchanged, `p2` remains unchanged, `a1` remains unchanged, and `a2` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, the `break` statement simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all other variables remain unchanged as per the initial postconditions.
