Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions that `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` are still valid.
