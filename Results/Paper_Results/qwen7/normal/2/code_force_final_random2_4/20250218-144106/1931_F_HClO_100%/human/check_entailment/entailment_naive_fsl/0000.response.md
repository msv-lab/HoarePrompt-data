Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the order of participants in the screenshots does not match the expected order after considering the user's perspective.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
5 4 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

However, the provided program will incorrectly output `YES` because it does not properly account for the fact that the second screenshot does not match the expected order after considering the user's perspective. The program assumes that if the first element in the second screenshot matches the last element in the first screenshot, it can insert the first element from the first screenshot into the second screenshot. This logic is flawed and does not handle all possible order mismatches correctly.

To illustrate, let's walk through the provided test case:

- First screenshot: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Second screenshot: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

The program would check if the first element of the second screenshot (`5`) matches the last element of the first screenshot (`5`). Since they match, the program would insert `1` (the first element of the first screenshot) into the second screenshot at the position where `5` is found. However, this does not correctly reflect the user's perspective, as the user would see the order `[5, 1, 4, 3, 2]`, which is not consistent with the expected order.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to incorrect outputs for some inputs. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
