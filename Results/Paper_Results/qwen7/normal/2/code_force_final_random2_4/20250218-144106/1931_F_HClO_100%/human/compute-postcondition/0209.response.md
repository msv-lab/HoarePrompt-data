Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `t` is 1, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` remains as the integer read from input in the first iteration, `a2` remains as the integer read from input in the second iteration, `l11` remains as the list of integers from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` remains as the list comprehension resulting in a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, and `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, the index `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, and the elements at indices `i + p1` in lists `l1` and `l2` are not equal, the elements at indices `i + p1` in lists `l1` and `l2` are not equal to `a2` and `a1` respectively, and the element at index `i + p1` in list `l1` is equal to `a2`.**

The code `idx1 = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `idx1`. No other variables are affected, so the values of `t`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, and the conditions involving these variables remain unchanged.
