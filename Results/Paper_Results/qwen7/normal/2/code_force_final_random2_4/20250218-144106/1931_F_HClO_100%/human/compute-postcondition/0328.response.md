Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is 2 or less.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a3` is a list of integers.
- `l3` is a list of lists of integers.
- `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration.
- `_` is `m-1`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('yes')
```

Given the initial state, the value being printed is a string `'yes'`, regardless of the values of `m`, `n`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, and `_`.

Output: **yes**
