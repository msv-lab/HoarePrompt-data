Output State: **`m` is 2 or less, `n` is an input integer, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and `_` is `m-1`, `a1` is the first integer input, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers input.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into a list of integers, where the first integer is assigned to `a1` and the rest are assigned to `l1`. Since the initial values of `m`, `n`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, and `_` remain unchanged, they are still as described in the initial state.
