Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged from the end of the previous iteration, `p1` and `a1` remain unchanged from the end of the previous iteration, `p2` is set to 1, and `a2` remains unchanged from the end of the previous iteration. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited; otherwise, no further changes are made to the variables.
