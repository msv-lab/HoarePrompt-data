Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`. Additionally, the elements at indices `i + p1` in list `l1` and `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal to `a2` and `a1`, respectively. Furthermore, if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `p1` is 1; otherwise, `p2` is 1 and `idx2` is 0. Also, `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement. All the conditions and values of the variables before the `break` statement remain the same.
