Output State: **`idx2` is `n - 2`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, and `p2` is 1. The list `l2` now contains an additional element `a2` at index `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`. Since `idx1` is `n - 2`, the value `a2` is inserted at index `n - 2`. The values of `idx2`, `idx1`, and `p2` remain unchanged as per the given conditions.
