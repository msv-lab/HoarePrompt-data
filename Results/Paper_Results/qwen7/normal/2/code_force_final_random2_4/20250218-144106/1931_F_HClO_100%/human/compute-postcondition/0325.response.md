Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `_` and `t`.
   - `_` is an underscore, which is used as a placeholder variable in Python when the value is not needed.
   - `t` is the number of iterations the loop should perform.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` is 2 or less.
   - `a3` is a list of integers representing the values entered during each iteration of the loop.
   - `l3` is a list of lists of integers also entered during each iteration.
   - `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration.
   - `_` is `m-2`, indicating the number of iterations performed.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs for `t` iterations.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `_` (which is `m-2`) indicates the number of iterations performed.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than `_`.
   - Since `_` is currently `m-2`, the loop will continue if `t > m-2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `m` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a3` and `l3` remain unchanged since they are not part of the loop head.
   - `val` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `_` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, so it will become `m-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`m` is 2 or less, `a3` is a list of integers representing the values entered during each iteration of the loop, `l3` is a list of lists of integers also entered during each iteration, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and `_` is `m-1`**.
