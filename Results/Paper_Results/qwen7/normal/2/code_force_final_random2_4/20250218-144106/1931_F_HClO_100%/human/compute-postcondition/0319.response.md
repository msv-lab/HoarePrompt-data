Postcondition: `m` is greater than 0, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple (a3, l3), and `_` is 0 or 1. If `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension of `i` for `i` in `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
