Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1**.

Explanation: The code initializes `idx1` and `idx2` both to the value of `i`, which is 1. The conditions involving `n`, `i`, and the relationship between `i`, `max(p1, p2)`, and `n-1` remain unchanged as no further operations are performed on these variables.
