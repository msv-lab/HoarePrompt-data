Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `m` will be greater than 2, `a3` will hold the first integer from each of the `m-2` inputs provided, `l3` will be a list of the remaining integers from each of these inputs, all converted to integers, and `val` will be a list containing `m-2` tuples, with each tuple consisting of an `a3` and corresponding `l3`.

In more detail, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The value of `m` will be greater than 2.
- `a3` will store the first integer from each of the `m-2` inputs.
- `l3` will contain the remaining integers from each of these inputs, converted to integers.
- `val` will be a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of an `a3` and the corresponding `l3` from the respective input, and the total number of such tuples will be `m-2`.

If during any iteration, the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]` is not met, the loop will break and print 'no'. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it will print 'yes'.
