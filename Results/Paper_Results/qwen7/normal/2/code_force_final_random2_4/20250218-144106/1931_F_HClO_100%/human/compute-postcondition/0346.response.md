Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `m` is 2 or less, `n` is an input integer, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and `_` is `m-1`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `a1` is the first integer input, `a2` is the second integer input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding elements equal to `a1`.**

In this output state, the variables `p1` and `p2` are initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
