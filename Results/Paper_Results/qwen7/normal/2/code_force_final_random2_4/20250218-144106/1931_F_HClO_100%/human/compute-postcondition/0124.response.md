Output State: **`idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is n - 2, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than i + max(p1, p2), `m` equals 2, the list `val` is updated with integers from the input, and `a3` is the first element of the unpacked list while `l3` contains the rest of the elements.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and unpacks the first element into `a3` and the rest into the list `l3`. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `val` is now updated with the integers from the input.
