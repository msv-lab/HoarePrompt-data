Output State: **`val` must have at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `val`, `a3`, or `l3`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Therefore, the conditions regarding `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain the same, and we simply note that we have broken out of the loop or conditional structure.
