Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is defined by the range function, which takes `m - 2` as its argument. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `m` and the underscore `_`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `idx1` is `n - 2`
   - `idx2` is `n - 2`
   - `p2` is 1
   - `m` must be greater than 2
   - `a3` is the first integer from the input
   - `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input
   - `val` is a list containing two tuples `(a3, l3)`

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `m - 2` must still be a positive number. This means `m` must be greater than 2 (which it already is based on the current state).
   - The loop variable `_` will increment by 1 each time the loop runs. Since the loop has run `m - 3` times so far, for the next iteration, `_` should be `m - 3 + 1 = m - 2`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `p2` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `m` must still be greater than 2.
   - `a3` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l3` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `val` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is the loop variable `_` to `m - 2`.

Therefore, the final state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples `(a3, l3)`, `_` is `m - 2`**
