Output State: **`m` must be at least 2, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `a3` is the first integer from input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input, the list `val` now contains this single tuple. The conditions and values of `m` and `a3` remain unchanged, and `l3` retains its list of integers.
