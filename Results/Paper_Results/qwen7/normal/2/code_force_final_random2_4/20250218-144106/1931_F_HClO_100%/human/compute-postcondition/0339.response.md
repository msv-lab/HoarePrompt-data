Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable mentioned here is `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `m - 2` is greater than 0, meaning `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is `m` is 3, and an input is taken but not assigned to any variable.

4. **Adjust the State for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 2. Since `m` is currently 3, it satisfies this condition. After the next iteration, `m` will be decreased by 1 (as per the range function behavior).

5. **Update the State**: After the next iteration, `m` will be 2 (since `m - 2` should be greater than 0, and `m` is initially 3, it will become 2 after one iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`m` is 2**
