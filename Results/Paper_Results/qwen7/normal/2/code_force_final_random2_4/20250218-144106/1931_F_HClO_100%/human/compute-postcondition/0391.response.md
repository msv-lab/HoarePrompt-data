Output State: **`i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block shown in the code snippet, the `break` statement indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we are currently inside. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
