Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and equals 1, `a1` is the first integer input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers input excluding the second input integer `a2`, `a2` is the second integer input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input after the first two integers, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. The current value of `l11` is not equal to the current value of `l22`.
