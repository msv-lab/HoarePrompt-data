Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and equals 1, `a1` is the first integer input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers input, `a2` is the second integer input, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input after the first two integers.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and splits them into a tuple. The first element of the tuple is assigned to `a2`, and the rest are unpacked into the list `l2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, and `l1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
