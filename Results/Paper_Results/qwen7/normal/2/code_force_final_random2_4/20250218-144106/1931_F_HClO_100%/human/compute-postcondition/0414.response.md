Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If these conditions do not hold, and `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
