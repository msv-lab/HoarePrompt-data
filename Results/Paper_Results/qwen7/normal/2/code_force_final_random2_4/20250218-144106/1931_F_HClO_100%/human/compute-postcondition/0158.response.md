Postcondition: `val` must have at least one tuple. `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` except those equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]` is true, the operation is performed; otherwise, no change occurs.
