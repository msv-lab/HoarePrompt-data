Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The list `val` will contain `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers. The value of `m` will be greater than or equal to 2 plus the number of iterations the loop has executed. The variable `idx1` will still be `n - 2`, `idx2` will still be `n - 2`, `p1` will still be 0 or 1, and `p2` will still be 0 or 1. The condition regarding the insertion of `a1` or `a2` into `l1` or `l2` and the comparison with `l3.index(a1)` and `l3.index(a2)` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop itself but rather by the conditions under which the loop operates.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `val` must have at least one tuple. `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` except those equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]` is true, the operation is performed; otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `val` must have at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to a list containing elements of `l` excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to such a list, no action is taken regarding `a3` and `l3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `val` must have at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `l3` is equal to the list comprehension, the program continues without breaking the loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
