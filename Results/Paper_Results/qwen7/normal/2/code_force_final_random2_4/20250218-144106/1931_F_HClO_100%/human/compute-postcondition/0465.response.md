Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to `l3` as a list. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged. The `val` list is updated to contain a tuple of `(a3, l3)`.
