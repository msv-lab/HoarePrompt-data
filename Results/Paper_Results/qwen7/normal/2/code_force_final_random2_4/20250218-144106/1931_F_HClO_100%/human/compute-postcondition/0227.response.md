Output State: **`idx1` is equal to `i`, `t` is 1, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` remains as the integer read from input in the first iteration, `a2` remains as the integer read from input in the second iteration, `l11` remains as the list of integers from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` remains as the list comprehension resulting in a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are adjusted such that the index `i + 1` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, and the elements at indices `(i + 1) + p1` in lists `l1` and `l2` are not equal, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or none of these conditions change.**

This means that the only change is that `idx1` is now assigned the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
