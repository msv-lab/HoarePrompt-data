Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from each input converted to int, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from each input converted to int, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples: each tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `m-2` times), the variable `m` will be greater than 2, `a3` will hold the first integer from each of the `m-2` inputs provided, `l3` will be a list of the remaining integers from each of these inputs, all converted to integers, and `val` will be a list containing `m-2` tuples, with each tuple consisting of an `a3` and corresponding `l3`.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `l3` is a list. If `l3` is not equal to the list containing all elements from `l` that are not equal to `a3`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, no specific change is made to `l3` and it remains as it was initially.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a3` is the current element from `val`, `l3` is the list associated with `a3` in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `val` must still contain more pairs, and if `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that excludes all elements equal to `a3` from `l`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
