Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `a1`, and `a2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `p2` is 1, `idx2` is now equal to `i`.**

This means that `p2` has been explicitly set to 1, while all other variables (`i`, `n`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `a1`, `a2`) retain their values from the end of the previous iteration.
