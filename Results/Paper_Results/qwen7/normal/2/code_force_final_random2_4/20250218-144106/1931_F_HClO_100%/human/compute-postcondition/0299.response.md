Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer entered, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers entered, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**.

Explanation: The line `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a tuple consisting of `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p2`, `m`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged from their initial states.
