Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int; `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input converted to int; `val` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`)**.

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` adds a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple: (`a3`, `l3`). After appending, `val` now contains two tuples: the original one and the newly added one. All other variables remain unchanged.
