Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `t` is 1, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` remains as the integer read from input in the first iteration, `a2` remains as the integer read from input in the second iteration, `l11` remains as the list of integers from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` remains as the list comprehension resulting in a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `p1` is 1, either `idx2` is `i + 1` and `p2` is 1, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the elements at indices `(i + 2) + p1` in lists `l1` and `l2` are not equal, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `p1 = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `p1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
