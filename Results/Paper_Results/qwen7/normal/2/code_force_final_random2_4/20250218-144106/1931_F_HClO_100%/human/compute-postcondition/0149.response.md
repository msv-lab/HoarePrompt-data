Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `val` initially contained one tuple (`a3`, `l3`), after appending, it now contains two identical tuples. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
