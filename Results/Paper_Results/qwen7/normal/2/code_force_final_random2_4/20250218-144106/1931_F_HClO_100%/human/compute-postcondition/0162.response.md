Postcondition: **`val` must have at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to a list containing elements of `l` excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to such a list, no action is taken regarding `a3` and `l3`.**
