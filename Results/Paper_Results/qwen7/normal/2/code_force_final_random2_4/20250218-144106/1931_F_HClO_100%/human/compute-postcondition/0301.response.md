Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and splits it into the first element (`a3`) and the rest of the elements (`l3`). The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p2`, `m`, and `val` remain unchanged from their initial states.
