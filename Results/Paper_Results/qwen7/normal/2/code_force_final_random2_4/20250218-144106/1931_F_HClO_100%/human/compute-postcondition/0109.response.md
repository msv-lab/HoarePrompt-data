Output State: **`idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is n - 2, `p1` is 1 or 0, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than i + max(p1, p2), `idx1` is less than `idx2`, and `l` is `l2`.**

The code `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. No other variables are affected. The conditions and values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, `i`, and the list `val` remain unchanged.
