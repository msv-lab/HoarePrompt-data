Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer entered, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers entered.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and splits them into a tuple. The first element of the tuple is assigned to `a3`, and the rest are assigned to the list `l3`. The variables `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged and are both equal to `n - 2`. The variable `p2` remains 1, and `m` must still be greater than 2.
