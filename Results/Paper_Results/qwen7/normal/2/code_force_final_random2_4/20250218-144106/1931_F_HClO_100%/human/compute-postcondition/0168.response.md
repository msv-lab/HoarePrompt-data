Postcondition: **`val` must have at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `l3` is equal to the list comprehension, the program continues without breaking the loop or if statement.**
