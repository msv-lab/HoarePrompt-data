Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables `y` and `n`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted based on the loop condition.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `y` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `y` starts from 1 and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `y` is currently 2.
   - `b` is the value at index 2 of list `l`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `y`**: Since `y` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `y` would be 3.

5. **Check the Loop Condition**: For the loop to continue, `y` must be less than `n`. Given that `y` is now 3, the loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the States**: We need to update `y` to 3. The other variables (`n` and `b`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `y` is 3, `b` is the value at index 2 of list `l`**
