Postcondition: `n` is greater than 3, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, `a` is the value at index `x` of the list `l`. If `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is the value at index `x` of the list `l`. If `a` is greater than or equal to the value at index `x` of the list `l`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is the value at index `x` of the list `l`.
