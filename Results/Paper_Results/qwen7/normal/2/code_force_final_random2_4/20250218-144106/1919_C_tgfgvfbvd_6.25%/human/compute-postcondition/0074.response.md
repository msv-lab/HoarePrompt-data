Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, `a` is the value at index `x` of the list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of the list `l` to the variable `a`. Given that `x` is equal to `n`, `a` will be the value at index `n` of the list `l`. The values of `n`, `y`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
