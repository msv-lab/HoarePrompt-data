Output State: **`y` is 3, `b` is `l[3]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or switch statement. In this case, since there is no loop or switch statement present in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `y` and `b`. It simply indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside, if one existed. Therefore, the values of `y` and `b` remain unchanged.
