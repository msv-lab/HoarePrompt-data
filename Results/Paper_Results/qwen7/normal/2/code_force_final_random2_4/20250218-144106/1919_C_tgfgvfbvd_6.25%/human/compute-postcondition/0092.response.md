Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 3.
- `y` is equal to `n-1`.
- `x` is equal to `n`.
- `c` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is the maximum value among `l[1]` to `l[n-1]` that satisfies `l[y] > l[y-1]`.
- `b` is the second maximum value among `l[1]` to `l[n-1]` that satisfies `l[y] > l[y-1]`. If no such values exist, `b` remains 0.

The print statement is `print(c)`.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the relevant parts:

1. `y` is defined as `n-1`.
2. `a` and `b` are determined based on the condition `l[y] > l[y-1]`. Since `y = n-1`, this translates to `l[n-1] > l[n-2]`.

However, the value of `c` is explicitly stated to be a non-negative integer and does not depend on the values of `a` or `b`. Given that `c` is a non-negative integer but no specific value for `c` is provided in the initial state, we can only conclude that `c` retains its non-negative integer value.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `c`.

Output: **c (where c is a non-negative integer)**
