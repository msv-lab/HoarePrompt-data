Output State: **`y` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, the element at index `y` in list `l` is equal to `b`, and the element at index `y - 1` in list `l` is less than the element at index `y` in list `l`. and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. All the initial conditions remain the same.
