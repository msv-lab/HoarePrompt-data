Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `y` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `x` is `n + 1`
   - `b` is `l[0]`
   - `c` is 0
   - `a` is `l[0]`
   - Either `l[y]` is greater than `l[y - 1]` (which is `l[0]` since `y` is 0), in which case we break out of the loop, or there is no else part in the code.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for y in range(1, n):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop variable `y` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be set to 1.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to run.
   - `x`, `b`, `c`, and `a` are not directly affected by the loop variable `y`.

5. **Postconditions:**
   - Since `y` is now 1, the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` becomes `l[1] > l[0]`.
   - If this condition is true, the loop will break.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `y` should be set to 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `x`, `b`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged.

**Final State:**
State: **`y` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is `n + 1`, `b` is `l[0]`, `c` is 0, `a` is `l[0]`, and either `l[1]` is greater than `l[0]` in which case we break out of the loop or there is no else part in the code.**
