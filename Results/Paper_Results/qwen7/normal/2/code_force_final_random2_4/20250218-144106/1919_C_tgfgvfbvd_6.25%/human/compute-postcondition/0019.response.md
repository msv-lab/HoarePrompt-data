Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `y` is 3, `b` is the value at index 3 of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `b = l[y]` assigns the value at index `y` of list `l` to variable `b`. Given that `y` is 3, `b` now holds the value at index 3 of list `l`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
