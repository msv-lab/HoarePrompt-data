Output State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, `a` is `l[x]`, `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b` otherwise `a` remains unchanged if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b` and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b` and `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is set to the value of `l[x]`**.

In this output state, the value of `y` remains `n - 1`, and the value of `x` remains `n`. The value of `a` is updated to be equal to `l[x]`. The condition for updating `c` based on the comparison between `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged.
