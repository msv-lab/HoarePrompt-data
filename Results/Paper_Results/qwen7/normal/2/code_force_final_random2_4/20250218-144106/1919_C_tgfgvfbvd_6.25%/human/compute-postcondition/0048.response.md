Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `b` is equal to `l[x]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `l[x]` to `b`. The values of `n`, `y`, and `l[x]` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `n` is still greater than 3, `y` is still equal to `n - 1`, and `b` is now equal to the value of `l[x]`.
