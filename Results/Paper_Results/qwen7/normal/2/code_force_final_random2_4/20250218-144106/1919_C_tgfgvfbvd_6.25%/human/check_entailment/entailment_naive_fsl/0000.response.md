Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to find the maximum and minimum values in segments of the array but does not actually compute the penalties for the subsequences \(s\) and \(t\).

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

However, the program outputs `0` instead. This is because the program does not properly split the array into two subsequences and calculate the penalties for these subsequences. Instead, it tries to find some values that don't align with the actual requirement of counting the number of indices where elements are increasing in each subsequence.

A correct approach would involve sorting the array and then splitting it into two subsequences such that the penalty is minimized. The provided solution does not achieve this. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
