Output State: **Postcondition: `y` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is `n + 1`, `b` is the maximum value among `l[0]` to `l[n-2]` (inclusive), `c` is 0, `a` is `l[0]`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `y` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The variable `b` will hold the maximum value among `l[0]` to `l[n-2]` because the loop breaks as soon as it finds an element that is greater than the previous one, setting `b` to that value. All other variables (`x`, `c`, `a`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
