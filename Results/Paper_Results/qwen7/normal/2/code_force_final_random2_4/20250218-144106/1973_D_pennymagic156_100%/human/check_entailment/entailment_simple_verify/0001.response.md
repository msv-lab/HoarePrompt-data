### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several issues in the provided program and proposed a corrected version. Let's analyze the original program and the corrected version to ensure the final evaluation is accurate.

#### Original Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to read input, which is correct.

2. **Query Functionality:**
   - The program attempts to determine the value of `v` by querying the smallest `r` for which `f(1, r) = i * n` for decreasing values of `i` starting from `n`. This is flawed because it assumes the maximum value of the array is `n`, which is not necessarily true.

3. **Splitting Logic:**
   - The program then tries to split the array into `k` subarrays such that each subarray has the property `f(l, r) = v`. This logic is also flawed because it assumes the maximum value is `n` and queries for `i * v`, which may not be correct.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array is not divisible into `k` subarrays with the required properties.

#### Corrected Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The corrected program uses the same functions for reading input, which is correct.

2. **Query Functionality:**
   - The corrected program determines the maximum value in the array first. Then, it queries for the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * max_value` for decreasing values of `i` starting from `k`. This is a more robust approach.

3. **Splitting Logic:**
   - The corrected program iterates over possible starting points `l` and queries for `i * v` where `v` is the maximum value. This ensures that the logic correctly checks for the required subarray properties.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The corrected program handles edge cases properly by checking if the maximum value is `1` and printing `-1` if so. It also ensures that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the required properties.

Given the analysis, the corrected program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and addresses the issues in the original program.

### Final Evaluation

**Final: True**

The corrected program is correct and should work according to the problem statement.
