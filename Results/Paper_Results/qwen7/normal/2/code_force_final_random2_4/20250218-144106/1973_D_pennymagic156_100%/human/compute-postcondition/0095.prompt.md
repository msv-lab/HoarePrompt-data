You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
def func_5():
    n, k = func_3()
    v = 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
        
        v = func_2()
        
        if v == n:
            v = i
            break
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, i is 0, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and v is either n (if the loop broke due to v == n) or the return value of func_2() (if the loop did not break).
    for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
        cnt, l = k, 1
        
        while cnt and l < n + 1:
            print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
            l = func_2() + 1
            cnt -= 1
        
        if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1:
            print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
            func_2()
            return
        
    #State: i is n-1, n is a positive integer, k is 0, l is func_2() + 3*(n // k), cnt is 0 - (n // k), and either cnt is not equal to 0 or l is not equal to n + 1.
    print('! -1', flush=True)
    #This is printed: ! -1
    func_2()
    return
    #The program does not return any value
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value. It either returns None or does not return anything due to the absence of a return statement.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.

Case_3: The program returns None

Case_4: The program does not return any value


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
