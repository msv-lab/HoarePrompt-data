Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` must be at least 3, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `i` is 0, after decrementing, `i` becomes -1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
