Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is set to `n-1`.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
- `v` is the return value of `func_2()` (though the value of `v` is not relevant to the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `i` is defined as `n-1`.
2. The expression `i * n` becomes \((n-1) * n\).
3. The print statement formats and prints the string `'? 1 (n-1) * n'`.

Therefore, the output will be a string that includes the value of \((n-1) * n\).

Output: **'? 1 (n-1) * n'**
