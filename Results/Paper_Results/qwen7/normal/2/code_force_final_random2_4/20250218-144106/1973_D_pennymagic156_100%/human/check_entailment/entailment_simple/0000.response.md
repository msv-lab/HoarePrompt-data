Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Purpose**: The annotated program defines several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) to handle different parts of the interaction with the user. Each function is correctly defined and serves its intended purpose based on the problem statement.

2. **Main Function (`func_5`)**:
   - **Initialization**: The function starts by reading `n` and `k` using `func_3()`.
   - **Finding Maximum Value `v`**: It iterates backward from `n` to `1`, querying the smallest `r` for `f(1, r)` equal to `i * n`. If such an `r` is found (i.e., `v == n`), it breaks the loop and sets `v` to `i`.
   - **Splitting the Array**: It then attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and maximum value equals `v`. This is done by iterating through possible starting points `l` and querying the smallest `r` for `f(l, r)` equal to `i * v`. If a valid split is found, it prints the result and exits.
   - **Failure Case**: If no valid split is found, it prints `-1`.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - `func_2()` reads an integer from input.
   - `func_3()` reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - `func_4()` reads a line of input and strips any leading/trailing whitespace.

4. **Interaction Protocol Compliance**:
   - The program flushes the output after each query to ensure timely responses.
   - The program handles the interaction correctly, making sure to print `! -1` if an invalid query is made or if the query limit is exceeded.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem statement correctly and handles the interaction protocol appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
