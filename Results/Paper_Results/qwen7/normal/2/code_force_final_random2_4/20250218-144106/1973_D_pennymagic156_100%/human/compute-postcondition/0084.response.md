Output State: `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 3 * (number of iterations)`, `cnt` is `0 - number of iterations`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`. Given that `cnt` starts at 1 and decreases by 1 each iteration, it will eventually reach 0 after `cnt` number of iterations. Since `l` is updated by adding `func_2() + 1` in each iteration, after `cnt` iterations, `l` will be equal to `func_2() + 3 * (number of iterations)` assuming `func_2()` returns a consistent value each time. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 2 throughout the loop iterations.
