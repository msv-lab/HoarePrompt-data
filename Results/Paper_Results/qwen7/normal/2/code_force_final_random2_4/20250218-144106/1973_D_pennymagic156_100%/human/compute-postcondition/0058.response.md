Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is `k - 3`. This implies that `k` is undefined or not explicitly set in the initial state, but it will be used in the calculation of `l`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1 + 1`. Here, `func_2()` is a function call whose return value is unknown from the initial state. Let's denote the return value of `func_2()` as `val`.
   - `cnt` must be greater than 0, but its value is not needed for the print statement.
   - `l` is less than `n + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - We need to determine the values of `l` and `v` to fully understand what will be printed.

Given the information:
- `i` is 1.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1 + 1`, so `l = val + 2`, where `val` is the return value of `func_2()`.
- Since `l` is less than `n + 1`, we know that `val + 2 < n + 1`, but the exact value of `val` is not specified.

The value of `v` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will represent it as `v`.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
- The string `'? '`
- The value of `l`, which is `val + 2`
- The value of `i * v`, which is `1 * v` or simply `v`

Since `val` is the return value of `func_2()`, we can represent it as `func_2_value`.

Output: **'? func_2_value + 2 v'**
