Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `v` is `i`**.

Explanation: The code `v = i` assigns the value of `i` to `v`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `v` is also set to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
