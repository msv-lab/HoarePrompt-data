Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is `k - 3`. Since no initial value for `k` is provided, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it is derived from `k - 3`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`. This means `l` is the result of calling `func_2()` and adding 1 to it, with the constraint that this value is less than `n + 1`.
   - `cnt` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - We need to determine the value of `v`. However, `v` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value directly.
   - Given that `i` is 1, `i * v` would be `v`.

Since `v` is not explicitly defined, we can only describe the components of the print statement in terms of the known variables and constraints.

Output: **'? [l] [v]' (where l is the result of func_2() + 1 and v is an undefined value)**
