Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `cnt` is 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l` to be the result of `func_2()` plus 1. Since `func_2()` returns a specific value (let's denote it as `val`), `l` becomes `val + 1`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
