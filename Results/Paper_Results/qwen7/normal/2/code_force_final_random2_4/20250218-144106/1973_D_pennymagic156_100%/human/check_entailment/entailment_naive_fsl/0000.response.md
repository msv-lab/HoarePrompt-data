Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the hidden array `a` contains multiple elements with different maximum values within the subarrays. Specifically, the program assumes that the maximum value `v` found in the first query (`? 1 {i * n}`) is consistent across all subsequent queries, which is not necessarily true.

For example, consider a hidden array `[1, 3, 2]` with `n = 3` and `k = 2`. The program would first query `? 1 3 * 3`, which would return `2` because `f(1, 2) = 2 * 3 = 6`. However, when querying `? 1 6`, it would incorrectly assume that the maximum value is still `2` and thus the answer would be `2`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `-1` because no valid split exists.

To fix this, the program needs to re-evaluate the maximum value for each subarray query, rather than relying on the initial value found.
