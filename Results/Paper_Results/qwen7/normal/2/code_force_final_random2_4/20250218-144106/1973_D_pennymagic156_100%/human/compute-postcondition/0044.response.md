Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `cnt` is 1, and `l` is equal to `n + 1**.

Explanation: The function `func_2()` is called, which increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially 0, after calling `func_2()`, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
