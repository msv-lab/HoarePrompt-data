Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` remains the same.
- `i` is now `n-2`.
- `k` remains the same.
- `v` remains the same.

The print statement is:

```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

Here, the expression `i * n` will be evaluated. Given that `i` is `n-2`, substituting `i` with `n-2` gives us `(n-2) * n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `'? 1 (n-2)*n'`.

Output: **'? 1 (n-2)*n'**
