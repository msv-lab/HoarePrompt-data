Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `n` is a positive integer, but its value is not needed for the current print statement.
   - `k` is not used in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant.
   - `l` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `cnt` is explicitly given as 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
   - `v` is not defined in the initial state, but it is part of the print statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - `l` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `v` is not defined, so we cannot determine its value from the initial state. However, since `v` is part of the expression `i * v`, and `i` is 2, the value of `i * v` will depend on `v`.

Given the information, we can only determine the values of `l` and `i`, but not `v`. Therefore, the print statement will output a string with `l` and `i * v`, where `v` remains unknown.

Output: **'? 1 2*v'**
