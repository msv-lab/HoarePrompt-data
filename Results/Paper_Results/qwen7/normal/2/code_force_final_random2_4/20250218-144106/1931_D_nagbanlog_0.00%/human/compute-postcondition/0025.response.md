Output State: **`beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `mod_y` is the remainder of the next `num` divided by `y`, `a` must contain at least one element, `mod_x` is the remainder of the next `num` divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is now present in `freq` with one more occurrence.**

Explanation: The code `mod_y = num % y` updates the value of `mod_y` to be the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
