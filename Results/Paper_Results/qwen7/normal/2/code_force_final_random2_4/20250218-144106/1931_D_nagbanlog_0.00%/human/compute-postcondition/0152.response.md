Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. After processing all test cases, it returns a list `results` containing the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case.**
