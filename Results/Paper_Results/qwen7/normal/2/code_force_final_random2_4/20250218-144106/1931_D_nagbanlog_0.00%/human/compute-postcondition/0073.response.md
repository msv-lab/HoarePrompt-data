Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`**

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` based on the values of `x` and `mod_x`. The value of `mod_y` remains unchanged, and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions and the calculation for `required_mod_x` are included in the output state.
