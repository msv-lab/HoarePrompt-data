Based on the initial state provided:

- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
- `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.
- `mod_x` is `num % x`.
- `mod_y` is `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the variables involved:

1. **`mod_x`**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
2. **`mod_y`**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
3. **`required_mod_x`**: This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`. Since `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `x - mod_x` is the difference between `x` and the remainder, and taking this modulo `x` will give `x - mod_x` if `mod_x` is non-zero, otherwise it will be `0`.
4. **`required_mod_y`**: This is simply `mod_y`.

Given these definitions, the print statement will output the following:

- `Number`: The value of `num`.
- `mod_x`: The remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y`: The remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x`: The value of `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y`: The value of `mod_y`.

Thus, the output will be:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [(x - mod_x) % x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]**
