Reasoning:
1. The provided function `func_1` correctly processes each test case according to the problem statement.
2. For each element in the array `a`, it calculates the necessary modulo values and checks if there are previously seen elements that form a "beautiful pair" based on the given conditions.
3. The function uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each modulo pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` and updates the count of beautiful pairs accordingly.
4. The logic for determining the required modulo values and checking the frequency dictionary is correct.
5. The function iterates through all test cases and accumulates the counts of beautiful pairs for each test case.
6. The final results are returned as a list of counts for each test case.

Given the above points, the function appears to be correct and should produce the expected output based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
