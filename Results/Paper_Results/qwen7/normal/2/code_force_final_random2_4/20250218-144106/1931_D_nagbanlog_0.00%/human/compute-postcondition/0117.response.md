Output State: **`beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 0**.

Explanation: The code sets the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` to 0. It does not affect `beautiful_count`, which remains unchanged. The tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not found in `freq`, so no increment operation is performed on `beautiful_count`.
