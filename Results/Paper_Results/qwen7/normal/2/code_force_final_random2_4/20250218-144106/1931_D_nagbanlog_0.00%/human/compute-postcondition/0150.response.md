Output State: **The `results` list will contain the final value of `beautiful_count` after processing all test cases.**

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will hold the final count of "beautiful pairs" calculated across all test cases. A "beautiful pair" is defined as a pair of numbers `(num, a_i)` where the required modifications to `num` to match `a_i` under modulo operations with `x` and `y` are found in the frequency dictionary `freq`. The `beautiful_count` variable accumulates this count for each test case, and the `results` list will store the cumulative result after processing all test cases.
