Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The code `mod_y = num % y` assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to the variable `mod_y`. The initial state of `num` and `mod_x` remains unchanged. Therefore, `num` is still the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is still `num % x`, and `mod_y` is now `num % y`.
