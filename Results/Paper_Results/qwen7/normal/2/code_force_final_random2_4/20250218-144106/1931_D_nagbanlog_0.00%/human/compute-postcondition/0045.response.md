Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by 1, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `a` must contain at least one element, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple \((required_mod_x, required_mod_y)\) is now present in `freq` with a frequency of 2.**

Explanation: The code increments the frequency of the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq`. Initially, this tuple was present in `freq` with a frequency of 1. After executing the line `freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1`, the frequency of the tuple increases by 1, making it 2. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
