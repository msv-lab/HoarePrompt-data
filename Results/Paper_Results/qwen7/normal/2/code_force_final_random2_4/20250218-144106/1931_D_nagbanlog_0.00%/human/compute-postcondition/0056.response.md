Output State: **`a` is case['array'], `mod_x` is num % x**

Explanation: The code calculates the modulus of `num` divided by `x` and assigns the result to `mod_x`. Since the initial values of `num` and `x` are not specified, `mod_x` is expressed as `num % x`. The variable `a` remains unchanged and is still `case['array']`.
