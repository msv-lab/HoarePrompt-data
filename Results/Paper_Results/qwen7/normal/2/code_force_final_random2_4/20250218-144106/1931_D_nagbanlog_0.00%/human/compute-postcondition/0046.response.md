Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by the number of times the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` appears in `freq` for each iteration, `mod_y` is the remainder of the last `num` divided by `y`, `mod_x` is the remainder of the last `num` divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is present in `freq` with a frequency equal to the number of times it appeared during the loop iterations.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `beautiful_count` will be the sum of frequencies of the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` for all numbers in `a`.
- `mod_x` and `mod_y` will be the remainders of the last number in `a` when divided by `x` and `y` respectively.
- `required_mod_x` will be `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` will be equal to `mod_y`.
- The tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` will be in `freq` with a count equal to how many times it appeared throughout the loop iterations.
