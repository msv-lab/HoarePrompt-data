Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head objects**: The loop head contains the variable `num` which iterates over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `a`**: The variable `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`. This means `a` is a list of numbers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `a` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `beautiful_count` is 0 and does not affect the loop execution.
   - `case` is `case['params']` containing `n`, `x`, and `y`. These do not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `test_cases` must have more elements to process, but this is not relevant to the current loop.
   - `a` is a list of numbers and must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - `freq` is an empty dictionary and does not affect the loop execution.

Given these points, the only state that needs adjustment is the list `a`, ensuring it contains at least one element.

**State:**
**`a` must have at least one element**
