Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
- `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.
- `mod_y` is `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for num in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
The variables involved in the loop head are:
- `num`

### Adjusting the States
To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `num` changes within the loop. Since `num` is the variable being iterated over in the loop, it will be incremented (or rather, moved to the next element in the list `a`) at the start of each new iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]`**: This is updated based on the current `mod_y`, but it does not change the state for the next iteration directly.
2. **`beautiful_count`**: This is updated based on the current `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`, but it does not change the state for the next iteration directly.
3. **`mod_y`**: This is calculated as `num % y`, so it will change to the next value of `num % y` in the next iteration.
4. **`required_mod_x`**: This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`, so it will change based on the new `mod_y` in the next iteration.
5. **`required_mod_y`**: This is equal to `mod_y`, so it will change to the next value of `num % y` in the next iteration.
6. **`num`**: This is the variable being iterated over, so it will change to the next element in the list `a`.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `num` will be the next element in the list `a`.
- `mod_y` will be the new value of `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x` will be `(x - mod_y) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` will be equal to `mod_y`.

### Final Answer
State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_y` is the new value of `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_y) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `num` is the next element in the list `a`**.
