Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`
- `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`
- `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`
- `a` is equal to `case['array']`
- `freq` is an empty dictionary
- `beautiful_count` is 0

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

Here, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` are directly taken from the `case` dictionary. Since the exact values of `case['params']` and `case['array']` are not provided, we will represent them as placeholders.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]**
