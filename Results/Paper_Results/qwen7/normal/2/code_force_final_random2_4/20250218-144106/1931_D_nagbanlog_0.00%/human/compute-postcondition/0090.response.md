Postcondition: `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and `beautiful_count` is updated by adding `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` to its current value if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is not in `freq`, the values remain as they were after the initial increment of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` and the update to `beautiful_count`.
