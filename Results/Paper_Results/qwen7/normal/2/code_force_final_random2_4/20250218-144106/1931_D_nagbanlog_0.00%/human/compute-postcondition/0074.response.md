Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

This means that the value of `required_mod_y` has been updated to be equal to `mod_y`, while `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` has been incremented by 1, and the values of `mod_y` and `required_mod_x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
