Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
   - `mod_y` is defined as `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is defined as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement outputs a formatted string with the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`.

Given this, let's determine the values of these variables:

- `mod_y` is `num % y`, which means it is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, which means it is the remainder when `x - mod_x` is divided by `x`.
- `required_mod_y` is directly assigned the value of `mod_y`.

So, the print statement will output:
- `num`: The original number.
- `mod_x`: The value of `mod_x` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but is used in the calculation of `required_mod_x`).
- `mod_y`: The remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x`: The value of `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y`: The same value as `mod_y`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [num % y], required_mod_x: [(x - mod_x) % x], required_mod_y: [num % y]**
