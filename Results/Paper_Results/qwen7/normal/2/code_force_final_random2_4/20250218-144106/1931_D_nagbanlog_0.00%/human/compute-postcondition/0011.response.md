Output State: **`mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `a` must contain at least one element, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. This means that `required_mod_y` now holds the same value as `mod_y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
