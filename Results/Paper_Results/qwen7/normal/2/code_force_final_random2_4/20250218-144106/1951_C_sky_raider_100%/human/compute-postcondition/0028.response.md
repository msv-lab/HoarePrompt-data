Output State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is `s * (l[0] + n - 1)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - (n-1) * s`, `c` is the sum of `c + s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `k - n * s`, `n` is updated to the integer input, `m` and `k` are updated to the integers split from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits it into a list `l`. This list replaces the existing `l` in memory. All other variables (`i`, `t`, `s`, `c`, `k`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and values as described in the initial state, except that `n` is updated to the new integer input, and `m` and `k` are also updated to the integers split from the input.
