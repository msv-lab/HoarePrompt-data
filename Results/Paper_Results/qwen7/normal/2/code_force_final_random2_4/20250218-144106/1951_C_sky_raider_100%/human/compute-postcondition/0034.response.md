Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.**

Explanation: The line `s = min(m, k)` assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to `s`. Since `i` and `n` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. The only new variable `s` is assigned the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
