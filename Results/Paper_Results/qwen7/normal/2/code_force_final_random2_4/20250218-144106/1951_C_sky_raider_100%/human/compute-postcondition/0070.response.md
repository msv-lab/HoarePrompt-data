Output State: **`c` is increased by `s * (l[i_prev + 1] + t) + s * (l[i] + t)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`, `t` is increased by `s`, `k` is decreased by `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2` and `s` is updated to be the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value, which was previously `c += s * (l[i_prev + 1] + t)`.
- `s` is updated to be the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`.
- `t` is increased by `s`.
- `k` is decreased by `s`.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `i` is set to `i_prev + 2`.
- `s` is again updated to be the minimum value between `m` and `k - s` after the addition to `c`.
