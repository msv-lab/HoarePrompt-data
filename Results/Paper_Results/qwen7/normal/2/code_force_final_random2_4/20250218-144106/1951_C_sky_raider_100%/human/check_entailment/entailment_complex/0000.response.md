Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases, \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) and the list of ticket prices \( a \).
3. It sorts the list of ticket prices, which is a reasonable step to minimize the overall cost.
4. The main logic of the program iterates through the sorted list of ticket prices and calculates the cumulative cost \( c \) by purchasing up to \( m \) tickets each day, adjusting the ticket price for subsequent days accordingly.
5. The program ensures that the total number of tickets purchased equals \( k \) and correctly handles the constraints of the problem.

Given the provided code matches the problem description and performs the necessary steps to calculate the minimum cost, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
