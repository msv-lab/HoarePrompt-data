Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not specified in the initial state but are known to be integers obtained from the input.
