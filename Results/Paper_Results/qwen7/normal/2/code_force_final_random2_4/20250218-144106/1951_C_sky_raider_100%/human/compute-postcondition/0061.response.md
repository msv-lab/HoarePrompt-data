Output State: **`c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `t` is increased by `s`, `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `t += s` increments the value of `t` by `s`. The value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not re-assigned. All other variables (`c`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `i`, and `n`) remain in their initial state as they are not affected by the code.
