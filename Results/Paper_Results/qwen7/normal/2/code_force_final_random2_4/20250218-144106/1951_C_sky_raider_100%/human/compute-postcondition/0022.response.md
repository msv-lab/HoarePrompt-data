Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `s * (l[0] + n - 1)`, `s` is `min(m, k - (n-1) * s) - (n-1) * s`, `c` is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `k - n * s`.

In this final state, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `t` will be updated to `s * (l[0] + n - 1)`, reflecting the cumulative effect of adding `s` in each iteration. The variable `s` will be the minimum value between `m` and the remaining value of `k` after subtracting `s` for each iteration, adjusted by `(n-1) * s`. The variable `c` will hold the total accumulated value, which is the sum of `s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for all iterations from 0 to `n-1`. Finally, `k` will be reduced by `n * s` after all iterations.
