Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`. Since the loop runs from `range(int(input()))`, `n` is the input value.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop runs for each value of `i` from `0` to `n-1`. After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be set to `0` and `n` remains the same.

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the input value**
