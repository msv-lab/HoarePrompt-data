Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `s * (l[0] + 2)`, `s` is `min(m, k - 3 * s)`, `c` is `c + s * (l[3] + t)`**

Explanation: The variable `t` is incremented by `s`. Initially, `t` was equal to `s * (l[0] + 1)`. After adding `s` to `t`, the new value of `t` becomes `s * (l[0] + 2)`. The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 also remains valid.
