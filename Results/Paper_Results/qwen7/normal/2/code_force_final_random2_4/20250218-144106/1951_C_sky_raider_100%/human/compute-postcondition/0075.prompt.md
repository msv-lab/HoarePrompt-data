Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9). a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    t = 0
    s = 0
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        c += s * (l[i] + t)
        t += s
        k -= s
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `s * (l[0] + n - 1)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - (n-1) * s`, `c` is the sum of `c + s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `k - n * s`.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` has reached the end of the range defined by `range(n)`, which means `i` is now equal to `n`. The variable `t` accumulates the sum of `s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for each iteration, where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `s` remains the minimum value between `m` and the remaining value of `k` after all subtractions. The variable `c` holds the cumulative sum of the expression `s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for all iterations, and `k` is reduced by `n * s` over the course of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `c` will be the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration where `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `t` will be the cumulative sum of `s` from all iterations, and `k` will be the remaining value after subtracting `s` for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all its iterations, `c` will be increased by the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration, where `s` is the minimum value between `m` and the remaining value of `k` after previous subtractions, `t` is incremented by the total amount subtracted from `k`, and `k` is reduced by the total amount subtracted from it. The final values of `s` and `t` will reflect the last subtraction performed in the loop, and `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to complete all its iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
