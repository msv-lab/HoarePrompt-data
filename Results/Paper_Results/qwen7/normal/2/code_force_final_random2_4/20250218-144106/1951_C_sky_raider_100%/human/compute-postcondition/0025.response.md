Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input())`, which implies `n < int(input())`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`.
   - However, the condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be less than `int(input())`. This means `n + 1` must be less than `int(input())`.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` should be `n + 1` because it is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- `n` should remain the same since it is not directly modified within the loop.
- `t`, `s`, `c`, and `k` are not part of the loop head and thus their values do not change for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `s * (l[0] + n - 1)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - (n-1) * s`, `c` is the sum of `c + s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `k - n * s`.**
