Output State: `bigList` is an empty list, and `smallList` is an empty list.

Explanation: After the loop executes as described, `bigList` and `smallList` have had their last elements removed each time the condition `len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` is met. Since the loop continues to execute until either `len(smallList)` is no longer greater than 0 or `bigList[-1]` is no longer equal to `smallList[-1]`, and given that the condition was met for 3 iterations, both lists will be emptied completely.
