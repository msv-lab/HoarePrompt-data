Output State: **`i` must be less than `len(a)`, `j` is `i + 2`, `sm` is `sm + a[i + 1] + a[j] + a[j]`, `cts` is `[sm + a[i + 1], sm]`**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by adding `a[j]` to its current value. Given that `j` is `i + 2`, the new value of `sm` becomes `sm + a[i + 1] + a[j] + a[j]`. The list `cts` remains unchanged from its previous state, which includes `[sm + a[i + 1], sm]`.
