Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` must have at least one element, and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**

Explanation: The code `bigList.pop()` removes the last element from `bigList`. Since the initial state specified that `bigList` had its last element removed and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, after executing the code, `bigList` will have one less element, maintaining the condition that `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` as long as `smallList` also loses its last element (which is not explicitly required by the code but implied by the initial conditions). The other conditions and the relationship between `bigList` and `smallList` remain unchanged.
