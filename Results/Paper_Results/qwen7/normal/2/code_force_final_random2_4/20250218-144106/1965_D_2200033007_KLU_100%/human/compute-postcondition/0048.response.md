The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array. The length of `a` is between 1 and 999 (inclusive), and each element in `a` is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). After processing, the function returns a list `cts` that contains all possible cumulative sums of subarrays ending at each index from 0 to the length of `a` - 1, and this list is sorted.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers and returns a sorted list `cts` containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays ending at each index from 0 to the length of `a` - 1.**
