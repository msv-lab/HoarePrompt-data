#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array, where 1 ≤ len(a) < 1000 and 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < len(a).

        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
        
    #State: `sm` will hold the sum of all elements in the list `a`, and `cts` will be a list containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays ending at each index from 0 to len(`a`) - 1.
    cts.sort()
    return cts
    #The program returns a list `cts` which contains all possible cumulative sums of subarrays ending at each index from 0 to len(`a`) - 1, and this list is sorted.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` of integers and returns a sorted list `cts` containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays ending at each index from 0 to the length of `a` - 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cts is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array a. Each element in cts is an integer within the range 1 ≤ s_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `odds` is a list that contains elements derived from the process described in the loop. Specifically, `odds` will contain elements that are either the previous element minus one (if the current `ct` matches the last element of `odds`), or the current `ct` itself (if it does not match). The exact contents of `odds` depend on the sequence of elements in `cts`.
    #
    #In more detail, `odds` will be constructed such that each element is either the previous element minus one if `ct` equals the last element of `odds`, or the current `ct` if it does not. This process continues until all elements in `cts` have been processed. The final `odds` list will thus reflect the cumulative effect of these operations over all iterations of the loop.
    #
    #The variable `cts` will be empty after all iterations of the loop have completed, as each element of `cts` is consumed during each iteration. The variable `ct` will be the last element of `cts` that was processed, but since `cts` is empty at the end, `ct` is effectively undefined in the context of the final state.
    return odds
    #The program returns an empty list for `odds` since `cts` is empty and no elements are processed in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `cts` and processes each element to construct a new list `odds`. For each element `ct` in `cts`, if `ct` matches the last element in `odds`, the last element is removed; otherwise, `ct` is added to `odds`. After processing all elements in `cts`, the function returns the final state of `odds`. If `cts` is empty, the function returns an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of the palindrome array a, excluding one sum. n is an integer representing the size of the array a, and it is guaranteed that 3 <= n <= 1000 and n is odd.
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0

            a[idx] = x

            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: All elements in the list `a` are assigned values based on the elements in the list `odds`, and `idx` becomes -1.
    return a
    #The program returns the list 'a', which contains values based on the list 'odds', and 'idx' is -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `odds` containing integers representing subarray sums of an array `a`, and an integer `n` representing the size of `a`. It constructs and returns the array `a` based on the values in `odds`. After processing, it sets `idx` to -1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList is a list of integers representing the complete set of subarray sums, and smallList is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array a. The elements in both lists are positive integers.
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        
        smallList.pop()
        
    #State: Output State: `bigList` is an empty list, and `smallList` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, both `bigList` and `smallList` have their last elements removed. Since the loop continues as long as `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, once these conditions are no longer met or `smallList` becomes empty, the loop stops. Therefore, after all iterations, both lists will be empty.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns an element from bigList which would be the last element before the lists became unequal or smallList became empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `bigList` (a list of integers) and `smallList` (a list of integers). It repeatedly removes the last elements from both lists as long as the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal and `smallList` is not empty. Once the conditions are no longer met, it returns the last element of `bigList` before the lists became unequal or `smallList` became empty. If `bigList` becomes empty during the process, the function returns the last remaining element in `bigList`.
