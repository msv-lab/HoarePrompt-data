Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it meets the problem requirements and produces valid outputs for the given constraints. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), the size of the array (`n`), and the subarray sums (`subarraySums`). This part is handled correctly.

2. **Sorting Subarray Sums**: The program sorts the subarray sums before processing them. This helps in identifying patterns and missing sums.

3. **Identifying Missing Sum**:
   - The program uses `func_2` to identify potential missing sums by checking for duplicates in the sorted list.
   - Depending on the count of odd values, the program decides how to find the missing sum using `func_3` and `func_4`.

4. **Constructing the Palindrome Array**:
   - `func_3` reconstructs the palindrome array based on the identified missing sum and the subarray sums.
   - `func_4` helps in finding the missing sum by comparing the largest sums in `bigList` and `smallList`.

5. **Output Generation**: The program prints the reconstructed palindrome array.

Given the detailed descriptions of the functions and the logic flow, let's verify the correctness:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Correctly generates all possible cumulative sums of subarrays.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Correctly identifies and filters out duplicate sums, helping to find the missing sum.
- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: Correctly reconstructs the palindrome array based on the identified missing sum and subarray sums.
- **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: Correctly identifies and handles the missing sum by comparing the largest sums in the lists.

Since all functions are implemented correctly and logically follow the problem statement, the overall program should produce valid outputs for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
