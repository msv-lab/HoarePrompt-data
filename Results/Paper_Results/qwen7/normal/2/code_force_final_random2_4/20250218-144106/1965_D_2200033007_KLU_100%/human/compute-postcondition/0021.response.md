Output State: **`prev` is equal to `x`, `x` is the second element of the list `odds`, `idx` is decremented by 1, `x` is assigned to `prev`.**

Explanation: The code `prev = x` assigns the current value of `x` to `prev`. Since `x` was previously the second element of the list `odds` and `idx` was decremented by 1, these conditions remain unchanged except that `prev` now holds the value of `x`.
