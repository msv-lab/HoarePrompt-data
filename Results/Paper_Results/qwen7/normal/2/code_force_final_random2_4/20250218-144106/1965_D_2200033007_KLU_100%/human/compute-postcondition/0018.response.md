Output State: **`prev` is equal to `x`, `x` is the second element of the list `odds`, `idx` is decremented by 1, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[n - 1 - idx]` to `(x - prev) // 2`. Given the initial state, `x` is the second element of the list `odds`, and `prev` is equal to `x`. Therefore, `x - prev` equals 0, and `(x - prev) // 2` also equals 0. Since `idx` is decremented by 1, the updated state includes `idx` being decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `odds`, and `a` remain unchanged except for the specific index `n - 1 - idx` which now holds the value `0`.
