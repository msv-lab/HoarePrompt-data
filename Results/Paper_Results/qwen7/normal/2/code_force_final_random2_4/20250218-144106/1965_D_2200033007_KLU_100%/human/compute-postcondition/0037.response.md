Output State: **`i` must be less than `len(a)`, `j` is `i + 1`, `sm` is `sm + a[i + 1] + a[j]`, `cts` is `cts + [sm + a[i + 1]]`, `cts` is `cts + [sm]`**

Explanation: The code `cts.append(sm)` appends the current value of `sm` to the list `cts`. The value of `sm` remains unchanged after this operation, but it is now also included in the list `cts`. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `sm`) remain in their previous states.
