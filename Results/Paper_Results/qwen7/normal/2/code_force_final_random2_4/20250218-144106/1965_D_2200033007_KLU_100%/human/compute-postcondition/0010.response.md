Output State: `bigList` is an empty list, and `smallList` is an empty list.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, both `bigList` and `smallList` have their last elements removed. Since the loop continues as long as `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, once these conditions are no longer met or `smallList` becomes empty, the loop stops. Therefore, after all iterations, both lists will be empty.
