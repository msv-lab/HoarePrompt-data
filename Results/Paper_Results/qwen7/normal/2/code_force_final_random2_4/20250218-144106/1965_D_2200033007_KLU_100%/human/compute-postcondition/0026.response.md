Output State: **`prev` is equal to the third element of the list `odds`, `x` is the third element of the list `odds`, `idx` is `idx - 1`, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[n - 1 - idx]` to `(x - prev) // 2`. Since `x` is the third element of the list `odds` and `prev` is also the third element of the list `odds`, the value of `(x - prev) // 2` is calculated and assigned to `a[n - 1 - idx]`. The values of `n`, `idx`, `prev`, `x`, and the list `odds` remain unchanged except for the updated value of `a[n - 1 - idx]`.
