You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Output

    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
    cts.sort()
    return cts

#Function 2:
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
    return odds

#Function 3:
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        prev = x
        idx = idx - 1
    return a

#Function 4:
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        smallList.pop()
    return bigList[-1]



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function accepts two parameters, `bigList` (a list of integers) and `smallList` (a list of integers). It repeatedly removes the last elements from both lists as long as the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal and `smallList` is not empty. Once the conditions are no longer met, it returns the last element of `bigList` before the lists became unequal or `smallList` became empty. If `bigList` becomes empty during the process, the function returns the last remaining element in `bigList`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly recovers a possible palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - This function computes all subarray sums of the input array `a`.
   - It iterates through all possible starting points `i` and ending points `j` to compute the sum of subarrays.
   - The resulting sums are stored in the list `cts`.
   - Finally, it sorts the list `cts`.

2. **Function `func_2(cts)`**:
   - This function aims to identify the unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - It uses a list `odds` to keep track of unique sums.
   - For each sum `ct` in `cts`, it checks if the last element in `odds` is equal to `ct`. If so, it removes the last element (to remove the duplicate). Otherwise, it appends `ct` to `odds`.

3. **Function `func_3(odds, n)`**:
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` filled with zeros.
   - It sets the middle element (if `n` is odd) or the two middle elements (if `n` is even) using the first element of `odds`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining elements of `odds` and fills the left and right halves of `a` symmetrically.

4. **Function `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**:
   - This function is not used in the given code and seems to be a placeholder or an unused helper function.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - This function correctly computes all subarray sums and sorts them.
   - However, it does not directly help in identifying the missing subarray sum or reconstructing the palindrome array.

2. **Function `func_2(cts)`**:
   - This function correctly identifies unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - It ensures that each subarray sum appears only once in the final list `odds`.

3. **Function `func_3(odds, n)`**:
   - This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - It correctly handles the symmetry required for a palindrome array.
   - However, it assumes that the input `odds` contains all necessary information to uniquely determine the palindrome array, which may not always be the case.

### Testing with Example Cases

Let's test the functions with the provided example cases to see if they produce the correct output.

#### Example Case 1:
- Input: `n = 3`, subarray sums except one: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`
- Expected Output: `[1, 2, 1]`

1. Compute all subarray sums:
   - `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`
2. Identify unique subarray sums:
   - `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
3. Reconstruct the palindrome array:
   - `[1, 2, 1]`

The function produces the correct output.

#### Example Case 2:
- Input: `n = 4`, subarray sums except one: `[18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9]`
- Expected Output: `[7, 2, 2, 7]`

1. Compute all subarray sums:
   - `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2]`
2. Identify unique subarray sums:
   - `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]`
3. Reconstruct the palindrome array:
   - `[7, 2, 2, 7]`

The function produces the correct output.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and testing, the given program correctly recovers a possible palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Therefore, the program is correct.
