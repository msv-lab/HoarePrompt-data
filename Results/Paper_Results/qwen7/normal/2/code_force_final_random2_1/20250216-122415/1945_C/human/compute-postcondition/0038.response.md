Postcondition: **`zero` remains unchanged, `one` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (previous_i + 2)), `one_perc` remains unchanged unless `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50`, in which case it is updated to math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)), `lst` now contains `i + 1` where `i` is `previous_i + 2`.**
