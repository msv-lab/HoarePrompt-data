Output State: **`lst` must not be empty, and there exists at least one `elem` in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; `final` now contains at least one element which is equal to `elem`.**

Explanation: The line `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `elem` satisfies the condition that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, this condition still holds true after the append operation. The other conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
