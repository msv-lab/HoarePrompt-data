Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `sl = list(s)` converts the string `s` into a list of its characters and assigns it to the variable `sl`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
