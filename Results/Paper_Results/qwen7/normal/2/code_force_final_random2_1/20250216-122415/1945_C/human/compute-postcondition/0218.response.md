Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in lst:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `lst`. At the end of the previous iteration, `lst` must have at least one element remaining.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `lst`, `ele` will take the next element from `lst`.
   - After processing an element, `lst` will have one less element.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `lst` must still have at least one element remaining.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `lst` will now have one less element than it had at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, but since we are focusing on the loop head variables, we don't need to adjust `mini` here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `lst` has one less element and still has at least one element remaining.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lst` must have at least one element remaining, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`** (Note: The exact value of `mini` does not change in the loop head, so we keep the general description). However, for clarity, we can specify that `lst` now has one less element.

State: **`lst` must have at least two elements remaining, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**
