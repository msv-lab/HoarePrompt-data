Output State: **`zero` is increased by 1, `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2, `i` is increased by 1, `n` remains the same, `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`i` + 1))**.

Explanation: The code calculates `zero_perc` as the ceiling of the ratio of `zero` to `i + 1` multiplied by 100. Since `zero` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, and `n` remains the same, these changes are reflected in the output state. The value of `one` is not directly affected by this line of code, so it remains as previously stated.
