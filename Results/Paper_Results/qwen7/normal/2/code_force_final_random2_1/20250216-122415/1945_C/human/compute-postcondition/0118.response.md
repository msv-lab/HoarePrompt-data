Postcondition: `zero` is 2, `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2, `i` is 3, `n` remains the same, `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of (2 * 100 / (3 + 1)), `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (n - 3 - 1)), `lst` is [3], and if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `i` is set to 3; otherwise, the values remain unchanged.
