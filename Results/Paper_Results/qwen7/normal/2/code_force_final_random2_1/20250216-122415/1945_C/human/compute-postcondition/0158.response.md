Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `pk` and `mini` are undefined, `final` is a sorted list that contains no elements, and the length of `final` is 0; `c1` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `c1 = o * 100 // n` tries to assign a value to `c1`. However, the variables `o` and `n` are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown. Since `c1` is assigned based on these undefined variables, its value cannot be determined. All other variables (`lst`, `pk`, `mini`, and `final`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
