Output State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `pk` and `mini` are defined such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`; `final` now contains the value of `elem`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `elem` satisfies the condition that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, this relationship remains unchanged. The initial conditions about `lst` having at least one element and the relationship between `pk`, `mini`, and `elem` are preserved.
