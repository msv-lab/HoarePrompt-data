Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `pk` is either `n // 2` or `s // 2`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is a sorted list containing either an element `n // 2` or `s // 2` or the element 0, and the length of `final` is 1; `c1` is either greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50; `sl` is a list containing each character of the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1' characters in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in the list `sl`; `zero` is 0, `one` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `mini = pow(10, 8)` sets the value of `mini` to 100000000. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
