Output State: **`i` is 0, `zero` is 1 (or `one` is 1), `zero_perc` is 100**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 0, and either `zero` is 1 (meaning the character at index 0 in `s` is '0') or `one` is 1 (meaning the character at index 0 in `s` is not '0'). The code calculates `zero_perc` as the ceiling of `zero * 100 / (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, the denominator is 1, and if `zero` is 1, then `zero * 100 / 1` is 100. If `one` is 1, the calculation would be invalid because `zero` cannot be 1 if `one` is 1, given the initial conditions. Therefore, `zero_perc` is 100. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they were not involved in the calculation.
