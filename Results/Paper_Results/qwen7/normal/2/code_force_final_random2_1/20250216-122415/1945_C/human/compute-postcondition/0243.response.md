Output State: **`final` is a list containing 0, `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `final`. The value of `c1` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation. The precondition that `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 is still valid.
