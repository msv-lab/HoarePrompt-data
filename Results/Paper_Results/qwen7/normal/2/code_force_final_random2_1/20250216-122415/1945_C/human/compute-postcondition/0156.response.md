Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `pk` and `mini` are undefined, and `final` is a sorted list that contains the elements `n - 1` and `elem` from each iteration where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the `final` list in ascending order. Since the initial state of `final` is a list that contains elements `[n - 1]` and `elem` from each iteration where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, the exact contents of `final` are not specified, but it is known that it will be sorted. The variables `lst`, `pk`, and `mini` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation.
