Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `mini` is still 100000000, `zero` is the total number of '0's in the string `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`, `_` is still 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is the input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution.

In the final state after all iterations of the loop, `zero` will be the count of '0's in the entire string `s`, and `one` will be the count of '1's in the entire string `s`. The list `lst` will contain all the indices `i + 1` where the conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` were met during the loop execution.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`, `zero` is the total number of '0's in the string `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`, `_` is still 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is the input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution, and `lst` must contain at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`, `zero` is the total number of '0's in the string `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`, `_` is still 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is the input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution, and `lst` must contain at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`, `zero` is the total number of '0's in the string `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`, `_` is still 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is the input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution, and `lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is the next element in `lst`, and `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
