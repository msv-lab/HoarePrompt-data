Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `lst` is an empty list.
   - `pk` and `mini` are undefined.
   - `final` is a list that contains the elements `n - 1` and `elem`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for elem in lst:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
   - Since `lst` is currently an empty list, there are no elements to iterate over.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The loop condition `for elem in lst` checks if `lst` is non-empty.
   - Since `lst` is empty, the loop will not execute at all in this case.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - There are no elements in `lst` to iterate over, so the loop will not execute.
   - Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time because it won't execute at all.

**Final Answer:**
Since the loop will not execute due to the empty list, no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`lst` is an empty list, `pk` and `mini` are undefined, and `final` is a list that contains the elements `n - 1` and `elem`.**
