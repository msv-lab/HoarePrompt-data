Output State: **`final` is an empty list, containing all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; `c1` is calculated as less than 50, `final` now includes the value of `n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `final.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after appending `n`, `final` now contains the value of `n`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
