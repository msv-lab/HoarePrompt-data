Output State: `mini` is still 100000000, `zero` is the total number of '0's in the string `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`, `_` is still 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is the input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution.

In the final state after all iterations of the loop, `zero` will be the count of '0's in the entire string `s`, and `one` will be the count of '1's in the entire string `s`. The list `lst` will contain all the indices `i + 1` where the conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` were met during the loop execution.
