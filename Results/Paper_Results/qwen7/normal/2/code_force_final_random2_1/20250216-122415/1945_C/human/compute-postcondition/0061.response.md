Output State: **`lst` must not be empty, `pk` and `mini` are such that there exists at least one `elem` in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; `final` contains one additional element `elem` where |`pk` - `elem`| = `mini`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the element `elem` to the list `final`. The condition for selecting `elem` is that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` should be equal to `mini`. This means that `elem` is already part of `lst` and satisfies the given condition. The other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `lst` must not be empty and there exists at least one `elem` in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini` still holds true.
