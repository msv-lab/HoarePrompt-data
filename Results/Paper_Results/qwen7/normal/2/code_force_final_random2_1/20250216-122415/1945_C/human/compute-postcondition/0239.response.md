Output State: **The variable `final` contains a sorted list of all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element equals `mini`.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. Since the initial state of `final` is a list of all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element equals `mini`, after sorting, `final` will contain these elements in sorted order. The values of `lst`, `pk`, and `mini` remain unchanged.
