Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `lst` must not be empty.
- There exists at least one `elem` in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.
- `final` contains one additional element `elem` where \( |pk - elem| = mini \).

### Loop Head
```
for elem in lst:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `elem` in `lst`.
2. **State Adjustments**: We need to adjust the state based on the loop head, which includes `lst` and `elem`.

### Adjusting the State
- **`lst`**: Since the loop is iterating over `lst`, it implies that `lst` might change during the loop execution (e.g., elements might be removed or modified).
- **`elem`**: This variable holds the current element being processed in the loop.

Given the postcondition from the previous iteration:
- `final` now contains one additional element `elem` where \( |pk - elem| = mini \).

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that:
- `lst` still contains at least one element.
- There exists an element in `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and this element is equal to `mini`.

### New State
Since the loop will continue as long as there are elements in `lst` that satisfy the condition, the new state should reflect that `lst` still contains at least one such element, and `final` will contain one more element from `lst` that satisfies the condition.

### Final Answer
State: **`lst` must not be empty, and there exists at least one `elem` in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; `final` contains two additional elements `elem` where \( |pk - elem| = mini \)**.
