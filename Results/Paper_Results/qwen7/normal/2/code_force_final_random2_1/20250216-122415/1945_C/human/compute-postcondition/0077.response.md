Output State: **`final` is an empty list with an additional element 0, `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`, and the value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The code snippet `final.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after appending `0`, it contains `0`. The calculation of `c1` as `o * 100 // n` remains unchanged, and the condition that `c1` is greater than or equal to 50 still holds.
