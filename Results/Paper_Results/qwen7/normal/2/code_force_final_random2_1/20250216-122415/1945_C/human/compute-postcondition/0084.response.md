Based on the initial state provided:

- `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.
- If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` becomes an empty list with an additional element 0.
- If `c1` is less than 50, `final` remains unchanged as an empty list.

Given this, there are two scenarios to consider:

1. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` will be an empty list with an additional element 0. In this case, `final` would look like `[0]`.
2. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` remains an empty list, i.e., `final = []`.

In both cases, `final[0]` will either be `0` (if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50) or `None` (if `c1` is less than 50, because accessing the first element of an empty list results in `None`).

Since the problem does not specify the value of `c1`, we must consider both possibilities. However, the most precise description based on the given information is that `final[0]` will be `0` if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, and `None` otherwise.

Output: **0** (if c1 >= 50) or **None** (if c1 < 50)
