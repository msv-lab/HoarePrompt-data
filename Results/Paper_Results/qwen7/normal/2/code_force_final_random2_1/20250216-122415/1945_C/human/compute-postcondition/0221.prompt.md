Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is n-1, zero is the count of '0' characters in the string s, one is the count of '1' characters in the string s, zero_perc is 50, one_perc is 50, and lst contains all indices from 1 to n (inclusive) where the percentage of zeros up to that index is at least 50 and the percentage of ones from that index to the end is at least 50.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lst` must have at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `lst` must have at least one element remaining, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `lst` must have at least two elements remaining, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
