Output State: **`final` is an empty list with an additional element 0 if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` remains an empty list; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is an integer divided by 2 to get `pk`; `s` is the input string; `sl` is a list containing all characters of the input string `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`; `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `lst = []` creates a new empty list and assigns it to the variable `lst`. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `final`, `t`, `n`, `pk`, `s`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, and `one` remain unchanged from their initial states.
