Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will continue if `i < n-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `zero` remains unchanged.
   - `one` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged.
   - `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (previous_i + 2))`.
   - `one_perc` remains unchanged unless `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50`, in which case it is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
   - `lst` now contains `i + 1` where `i` is `previous_i + 1`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, the next value of `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `zero` remains unchanged.
   - `one` may remain unchanged or increase by 1, but since we don't know the exact value, we keep it as is.
   - `zero_perc` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i` (which is `previous_i + 1`).
   - `one_perc` will remain unchanged unless the condition `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` is met, in which case it will be updated.
   - `lst` will contain `i + 1` where `i` is `previous_i + 1`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`zero` remains unchanged, `one` remains unchanged, `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (previous_i + 3)), `one_perc` remains unchanged unless zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50, in which case it is updated to math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (previous_i + 1) - 1)), `lst` now contains `previous_i + 2`**.
