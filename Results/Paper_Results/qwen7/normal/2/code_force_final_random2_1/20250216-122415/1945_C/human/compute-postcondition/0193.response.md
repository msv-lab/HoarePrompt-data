Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `zero` is 1
   - `zero_perc` is 100
   - `one` is 1
   - `one_perc` is 0
   - `lst` is a list containing 1

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Given that `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i < n - 1` implies `1 < n - 1` or `n > 2`).

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to update `i` to 1 and ensure `n` is greater than 2. The other variables (`zero`, `zero_perc`, `one`, `one_perc`, and `lst`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is 0, and `lst` is a list containing 1**
