Postcondition: **`zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', `one` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 2)), `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 2)). If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is also greater than or equal to 50, the current index `i + 1` is added to the list `lst`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `lst` remains unchanged.**
