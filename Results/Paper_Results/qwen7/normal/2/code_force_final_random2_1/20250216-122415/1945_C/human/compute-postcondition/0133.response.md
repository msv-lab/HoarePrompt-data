Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `lst`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `lst`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` is `[3, 5, n - 1]`
   - `mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - 3))`
   - `ele` is `3`

4. **Determine the next value of `ele`**: Since `ele` was `3` in the previous iteration, it means the loop has already processed `3`. The next value of `ele` will be the next element in `lst`, which is `5`.

5. **Adjust the state of `lst`**: After processing `3`, the list `lst` will be updated to remove `3` from it. Therefore, `lst` will now be `[5, n - 1]`.

6. **Keep other states unchanged**: The state of `mini` and `pk` should remain the same since they are not directly affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`lst` is [5, n - 1], `mini` is min(mini, abs(pk - 3)), `ele` is 5**
