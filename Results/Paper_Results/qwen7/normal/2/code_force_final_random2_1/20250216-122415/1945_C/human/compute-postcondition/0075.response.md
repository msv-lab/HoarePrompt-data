Output State: **`final` is an empty list, containing all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `c1 = o * 100 // n` calculates the value of `c1` based on the values of `o` and `n`. However, the initial state of `final` remains unchanged as the code does not affect the list `final`. Therefore, `final` is still an empty list containing all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`. The value of `c1` is updated to the result of the calculation.
