Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of constraints where `t` is an integer between 1 and 20,000 (inclusive), and for each test case, `n` is an integer between 3 and 300,000 (inclusive), and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 300,000. The function returns a result based on the given constraints.**

This means the function indirectly accepts `t`, `n`, and `a` through predefined constraints and returns a result based on these inputs.
