Output State: **`zero` is 3; `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 3; `i` is 4; `n` remains the same; `zero_perc` is 30; `one_perc` is 0; `lst` is [3]**.

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Given the initial state, `o` is not defined, but since `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 3, and `one` is initially increased by 3, `o` must be 3. `n` remains the same, `i` is 4, and `zero_perc` is 30. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{one\_perc} = \mathbf{\text{math.ceil}}\left(\frac{3 - (\text{increased value of } one)}{n - 4 - 1}\right) \]

Since `one` is increased by 3 (as it starts from 3 and is increased by 3), the numerator becomes \(3 - 3 = 0\). Thus, `one_perc` becomes:

\[ \text{one\_perc} = \mathbf{\text{math.ceil}}\left(\frac{0}{n - 5}\right) = 0 \]

All other variables remain unchanged.
