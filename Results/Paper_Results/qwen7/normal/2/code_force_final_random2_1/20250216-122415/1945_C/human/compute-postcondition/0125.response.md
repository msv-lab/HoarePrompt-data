Output State: **`zero` is 3; `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 3; `i` is 4; `n` remains the same; `zero_perc` is 30; `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (n - 3 - 1)); `lst` is [3]**.

Explanation: The code updates `zero_perc` to the ceiling of `(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Given that `zero` is 3 and `i` is 4, the calculation is `math.ceil(3 * 100 / (4 + 1)) = math.ceil(300 / 5) = math.ceil(60) = 60`. However, since the initial postcondition already specifies that `zero_perc` is 50, and no further information about `s` or `o` is provided, we keep `zero_perc` as 50 unless otherwise specified. The other variables remain unchanged.
