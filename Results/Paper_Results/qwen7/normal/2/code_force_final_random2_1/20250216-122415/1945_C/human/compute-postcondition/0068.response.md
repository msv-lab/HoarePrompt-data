Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `lst` must not be empty, and there exists at least one `elem` in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`. Additionally, `final` contains three additional elements where one is `elem` and the other two are also elements in `lst` such that their absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each element `elem` in `lst`.

3. **Adjusting States**: We need to consider how the loop head affects the states of the variables involved in the loop. Specifically, the loop head involves the variable `elem` from the list `lst`.

4. **Conditions for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `lst` must still contain at least one element that satisfies the condition (absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`). Since we are iterating through `lst`, the next `elem` should also satisfy this condition.

5. **State Adjustment**: After the current iteration, `lst` might have changed if an element was removed or if the loop body modified `final`. However, the key is to ensure that the next `elem` still satisfies the condition.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `lst` must not be empty and must contain at least one element that satisfies the condition.
- The next `elem` should be the next element in `lst` that satisfies the condition.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not specified, we can only say that it must satisfy the condition. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `lst` is not empty and contains at least one element that satisfies the condition.

**State: **`lst` must not be empty, and there exists at least one `elem` in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**
