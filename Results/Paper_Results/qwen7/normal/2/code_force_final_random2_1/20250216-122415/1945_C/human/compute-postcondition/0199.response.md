Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `zero` is either 2 or 1, `zero_perc` is 50, `one` is either 1 or 2, `one_perc` is 0, `lst` is a list containing 1, `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (`n` - `i` - 1))**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `one_perc` using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Here, `o` is a placeholder for `zero`, which can be either 2 or 1, and `n` is greater than 2. Since `i` is 1, the denominator `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 2`. Given that `zero` is either 2 or 1, and `one` is either 1 or 2, the expression `(o - one)` will be either 1 or -1. Therefore, `one_perc` will be:

- If `o` is 2 and `one` is 1, then `one_perc` is `math.ceil(1 * 100 / (n - 2))`, which is 50 because `n` is greater than 2.
- If `o` is 1 and `one` is 2, then `one_perc` is `math.ceil(-1 * 100 / (n - 2))`, which would be -50, but since `one_perc` is set to 0, it remains 0.

Thus, the updated value of `one_perc` is 0, and all other variables remain unchanged.
