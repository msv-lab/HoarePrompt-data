Postcondition: `lst` must have at least one element, `pk` and `mini` are defined such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`. The current value of `elem` in `lst` satisfies this condition, and no other specific values are provided for the elements of `lst` other than the relationship involving `pk` and `mini`.
