Output State: `lst` is an empty list, `pk` and `mini` are undefined, and `final` is a list that contains the elements `n - 1` and `elem` from all iterations where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `lst` will be empty because all elements have been processed. The variables `pk` and `mini` will be undefined as they are not reassigned within the loop. The list `final` will contain the elements `n - 1` and `elem` from each iteration where the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini` was true.
