Postcondition: `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `lst` are updated as follows:
- If `s[i] == '0'`, then `zero` is incremented by 1, `zero_perc` is recalculated as `math.ceil((zero - 1) * 100 / (previous_i + 4))`, and `lst` contains `previous_i + 2`.
- If `s[i] != '0'`, then `one` is incremented by 1, `zero_perc` is recalculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (previous_i + 3))`, and `lst` contains `previous_i + 3`.
- `one_perc` remains unchanged unless `zero_perc` and `one_perc` both meet certain conditions: 
  - For the if part, if `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`, `one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (previous_i + 1) - 1))`.
  - For the else part, if `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`, `one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((one - zero) * 100 / (lst[-1] - (previous_i + 1) - 1))`.
