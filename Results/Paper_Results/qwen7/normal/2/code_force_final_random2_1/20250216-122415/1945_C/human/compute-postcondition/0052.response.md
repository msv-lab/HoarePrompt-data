Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ele` and `lst`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `lst`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`.
   - `zero` is the total number of '0's in the string `s`.
   - `one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`.
   - `_` is still 0.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`.
   - `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`.
   - `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution, and `lst` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the elements in `lst`, we need to ensure that `lst` still contains at least one element for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`mini`, `zero`, `one`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`mini` is the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`, `zero` is the total number of '0's in the string `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`, `_` is still 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is the input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution, and `lst` must contain at least one element.**
