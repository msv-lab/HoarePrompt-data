Output State: **`zero` remains unchanged, `one` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (previous_i + 2)), `one_perc` remains unchanged, `lst` now contains `i + 1`, `i` is `previous_i + 2`, `one_perc` is updated to math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))**.

Explanation:
- The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`.
- The value of `i` is updated to `previous_i + 2`.
- The value of `one_perc` is updated based on the new value of `i`, but the exact value depends on the current values of `o` and `one`.
