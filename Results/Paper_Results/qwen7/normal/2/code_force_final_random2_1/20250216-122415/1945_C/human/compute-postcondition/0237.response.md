Postcondition: **`lst` must have at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing the current value of `elem`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` is updated to contain the value of `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged.**
