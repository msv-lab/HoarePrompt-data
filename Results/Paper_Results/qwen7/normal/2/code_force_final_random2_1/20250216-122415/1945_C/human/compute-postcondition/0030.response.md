Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable in this case is `i`, and the loop runs from `range(n - 1)`. This means `i` starts at 0 and goes up to `n - 2`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0'.
   - `one` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0'.
   - `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 2))`.
   - `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 2))`.
   - If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is also greater than or equal to 50, the current index `i + 1` is added to the list `lst`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `lst` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `previous_i + 1`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is `i < n - 1`, so `i` should be `previous_i + 1 < n - 1`, which simplifies to `i < n - 2`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `previous_i + 1`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `lst`.

Since no specific values for `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `lst` are given, we will just update `i` to `previous_i + 1`.

**State:**
- `zero` remains unchanged.
- `one` remains unchanged.
- `zero_perc` remains unchanged.
- `one_perc` remains unchanged.
- `lst` remains unchanged.
- `i` is updated to `previous_i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[previous_i + 1]` is '0', `one` is increased by 1 if `s[previous_i + 1]` is not '0', `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (previous_i + 3))`, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - previous_i - 3))`, and `lst` remains unchanged.**
