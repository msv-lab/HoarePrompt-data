Postcondition: `final` is a list that either remains empty or includes an additional element 0, depending on whether `c1` is greater than or equal to 50. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` becomes an empty list with an additional element 0. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` remains as an empty list containing all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.
