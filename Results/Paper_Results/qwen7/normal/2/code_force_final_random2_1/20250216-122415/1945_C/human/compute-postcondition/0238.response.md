Output State: **The variable `final` contains a list of all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and the element equals `mini`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `final` will include every element from `lst` that has the same absolute difference with `pk` as the minimum difference found during the loop's execution. The other variables (`lst`, `mini`, and `pk`) remain in their post-loop states, but since the problem specifies only the changes within the loop affect the output, we focus on how `final` is populated based on the conditions inside the loop.
