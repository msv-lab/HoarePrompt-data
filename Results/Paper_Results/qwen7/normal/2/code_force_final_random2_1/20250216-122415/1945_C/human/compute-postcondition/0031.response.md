Output State: **`zero` is `zero` + 1, `one` remains unchanged, `zero_perc` remains unchanged, `one_perc` remains unchanged, `lst` remains unchanged, `i` is `previous_i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `zero += 1` increments the value of `zero` by 1. The other variables (`one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `lst`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The new value of `zero` is the original value of `zero` plus 1. The value of `i` is updated to `previous_i + 1`.
