Output State: **`i` is 0, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is 0, and `lst` is a list containing 1.**

Explanation: The code `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 0, `i + 1` equals 1. Therefore, `lst` now contains the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
