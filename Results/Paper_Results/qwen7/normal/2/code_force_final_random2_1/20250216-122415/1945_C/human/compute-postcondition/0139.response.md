Output State: **`lst` is `[n - 1]`, `mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - n + 1))`.**

The list `lst` contains only the last element processed, which is `n - 1`. The variable `mini` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `n - 1`. All other variables (`zero`, `one`, `i`, `n`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `t`, and `final`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states since they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
