Based on the initial state provided:

- `lst` is an empty list.
- `pk` and `mini` are undefined.
- `final` is a sorted list containing either an element `n` or the element 0, and the length of `final` is 1.
- `c1` is either greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50.

The key point here is that `final` is a sorted list with a length of 1. This means `final` contains exactly one element, which could be either `n` or `0`.

When the code `print(final[0])` is executed, it will print the first (and only) element of the list `final`.

Since `final` is guaranteed to have exactly one element, the output will be either `n` or `0`.

Output: **0 or n**
