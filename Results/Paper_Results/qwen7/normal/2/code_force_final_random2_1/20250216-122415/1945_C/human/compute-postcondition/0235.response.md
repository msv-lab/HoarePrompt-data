Output State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `lst`, `final` is a list containing the current value of `elem`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `elem` is the next element in `lst`, `final` now contains the current value of `elem` in a list format. The initial conditions about `lst` and `elem` remain unchanged.
