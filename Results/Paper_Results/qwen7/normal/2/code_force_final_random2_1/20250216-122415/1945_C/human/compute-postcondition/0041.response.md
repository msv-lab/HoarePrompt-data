Output State: **`zero` remains unchanged, `one` is `one + 1`, `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (previous_i + 3)), `one_perc` remains unchanged unless zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50, in which case it is updated to math.ceil((one - zero) * 100 / (lst[-1] - (previous_i + 1) - 1)), `lst` now contains `previous_i + 3`**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `one` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `lst` was previously containing `previous_i + 2`, after adding one to `one`, `lst` now contains `previous_i + 3`. The conditions for updating `one_perc` are not specified to be met in this step, so `one_perc` remains unchanged unless the conditions are satisfied later.
