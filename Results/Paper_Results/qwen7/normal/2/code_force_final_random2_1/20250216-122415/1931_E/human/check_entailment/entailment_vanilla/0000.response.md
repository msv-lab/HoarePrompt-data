Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the winner of the game between Sasha and Anna.
   - Sasha and Anna take turns based on specific rules.
   - The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, and the final number must be checked against \(10^m\).

2. **Key Points in the Program**:
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `zerocnts`.
   - `func_1` is the main function that decides the winner.
   - `zerocnts` calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It checks if there's only one number (`n == 1`). If true, it compares the length of the reversed and original numbers to decide the winner.
   - It sums the lengths of all numbers after converting them to strings.
   - It sorts the count of trailing zeros in descending order.
   - It iterates over the sorted counts, subtracting every second count from the total sum.
   - Finally, it returns 'Sasha' if the total is greater than or equal to \(m+1\), otherwise 'Anna'.

4. **Function `zerocnts`**:
   - Converts the number to a string.
   - Counts the number of trailing zeros by iterating from the end of the string until a non-zero digit is found.
   - Returns the count of trailing zeros.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The logic for deciding the winner when there's only one number is flawed. The comparison should be based on the actual values, not just their lengths.
   - The logic for calculating the total length and subtracting the counts of trailing zeros is also incorrect. This approach does not align with the game rules.

2. **Missing Handling of Game Rules**:
   - The program does not implement the core game logic where players take turns reversing digits (Anna) and concatenating numbers (Sasha).
   - There is no mechanism to simulate the game turns and check the final condition.

3. **Incorrect Final Decision**:
   - The final decision in `func_1` is based on a flawed calculation. It should consider the actual values of the numbers after all operations, not just the sum of lengths or trailing zeros.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic and therefore cannot determine the correct winner based on the problem description.

**Correctness: **False**
