Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is less than 0, `tot` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in `num`.

Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `i` until it encounters a digit that is not '0' or it has iterated through the entire string `num`. The variable `tot` keeps a count of how many trailing zeros the string `num` has. Once `i` becomes less than 0, the loop terminates, and `tot` will hold the total count of trailing zeros in `num`.
