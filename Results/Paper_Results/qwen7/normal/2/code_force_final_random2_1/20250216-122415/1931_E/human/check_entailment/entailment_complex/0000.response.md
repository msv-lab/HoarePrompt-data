### Reasoning:

1. **Function `zerocnts` Analysis:**
   - This function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer.
   - The logic is sound: it iterates backward through the string representation of the number until it finds a non-zero digit or reaches the beginning of the string.
   - The function handles all edge cases, including single-digit numbers and numbers with leading zeros (though leading zeros are removed in the game).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Base Case:** When `n == 1`, the function directly compares the length of the string representation of the number with `m + 1`. This is correct because if there is only one number left, Anna cannot make a move, and Sasha wins if the number is at least \(10^{m+1}\).
   - **General Case:**
     - The function calculates the total length of the string representations of all numbers in the list (`tot`).
     - It then sorts the count of trailing zeros in each number in descending order (`cntvals`).
     - The function iterates over `cntvals` in steps of 2, subtracting the count of trailing zeros from `tot`.
     - The final check is whether `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.
   - The logic behind adjusting `tot` by subtracting the count of trailing zeros is correct. This adjustment simulates the effect of Sasha's concatenation moves, which reduce the effective length of the numbers in the list.

3. **Overall Program Correctness:**
   - The program correctly implements the rules of the game and the strategy for determining the winner.
   - The base case and general case logic are consistent with the problem statement.
   - The use of `zerocnts` ensures accurate calculation of trailing zeros, which is crucial for the game logic.
