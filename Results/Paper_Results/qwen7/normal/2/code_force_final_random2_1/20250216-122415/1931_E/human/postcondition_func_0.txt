The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of integers in the list), `m` (a parameter determining when Sasha wins), and `nums` (a list of integers). It first checks if `n` is 1, returning 'Sasha' if the length of the string representation of the minimum between 1 and its reverse is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'. If `n` is not 1, it calculates the total length of the string representations of the numbers in `nums`, sorts the count of zeros in each number in descending order, and adjusts the total based on these counts. Finally, it returns 'Sasha' if the adjusted total is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.
