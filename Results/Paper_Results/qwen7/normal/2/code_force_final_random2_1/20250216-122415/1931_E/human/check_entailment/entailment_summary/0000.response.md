Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the solution, we need to verify that the logic implemented in `func_1` aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the base case where `n == 1`. In this scenario, it checks if the length of the string representation of the minimum between the number and its reverse is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. This is a correct approach because if `n` is 1, Sasha has no choice but to concatenate the single number with itself, and the resulting number should be checked against `10^m`.

2. **General Case Handling**: For `n > 1`, the function calculates the total length of the string representations of the numbers in `nums`. This is a crucial step as it helps in determining whether Sasha can force a win by concatenating certain pairs of numbers.

3. **Zero Count Adjustment**: The function uses `zerocnts` to count trailing zeros in each number. This is used to adjust the total length of the numbers. The logic here is that trailing zeros do not contribute to the length of the number when concatenated, so they are subtracted from the total.

4. **Win Condition Check**: The function finally checks if the adjusted total length is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If true, Sasha can force a win by concatenating appropriate pairs of numbers. Otherwise, Anna can prevent Sasha from reaching the required length, ensuring her victory.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the logic in `func_1` seems to correctly implement the game rules and determine the winner based on optimal play.

Correctness: **True**
