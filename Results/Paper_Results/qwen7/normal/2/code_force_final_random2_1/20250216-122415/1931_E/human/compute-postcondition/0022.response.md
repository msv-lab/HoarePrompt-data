Functionality: The function accepts an integer `num` between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive and returns the total count of trailing zeros in its string representation. After executing the function, the program state includes the original integer transformed into a string, a loop that counts the trailing zeros, and finally returns the count of these zeros.
