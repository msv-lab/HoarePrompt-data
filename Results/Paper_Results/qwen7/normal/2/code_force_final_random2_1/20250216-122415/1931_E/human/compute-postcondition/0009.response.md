Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `tot` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
