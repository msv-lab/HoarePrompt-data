Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and the range function arguments. In this case, the loop runs from `len(num) - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.
   - `i` is `len(num) - 2`.
   - `tot` is 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. After each iteration, `i` is decremented by 1.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` was `len(num) - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i - 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `num` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes `len(num) - 3`.
   - `tot` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is `len(num) - 3`, `tot` is 2**
