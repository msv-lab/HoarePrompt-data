Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

    print(func_1(n, m, nums))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of integers in the list, m is an integer representing the parameter determining when Sasha wins, and nums is a list of integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each a_i in nums.
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    if (n == 1) :
        return 'Sasha' if len(str(min(n, int(str(n)[::-1])))) >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
        #The program returns 'Sasha' if the length of the string representation of the minimum between 1 and its reverse is greater than or equal to m + 1, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.

    tot = sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `2 * len(cntvals)`, `tot` is `tot - (sum of all elements in cntvals)`. 
    #
    #In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to twice the length of `cntvals`, meaning it has incremented by 2 for each iteration until it reaches or exceeds the length of `cntvals`. The variable `tot` will be reduced by the sum of all values in `cntvals`, as each value in `cntvals` from index 0 to the last index is subtracted in each iteration of the loop.
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
    #The program returns 'Sasha' if the value of `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of integers in the list), `m` (a parameter determining when Sasha wins), and `nums` (a list of integers). It first checks if `n` is 1, returning 'Sasha' if the length of the string representation of the minimum between 1 and its reverse is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'. If `n` is not 1, it calculates the total length of the string representations of the numbers in `nums`, sorts the count of zeros in each number in descending order, and adjusts the total based on these counts. Finally, it returns 'Sasha' if the adjusted total is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, representing an element in the list that Anna or Sasha manipulates during their turns.
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        
        tot += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is less than 0, `tot` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in `num`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `i` until it encounters a digit that is not '0' or it has iterated through the entire string `num`. The variable `tot` keeps a count of how many trailing zeros the string `num` has. Once `i` becomes less than 0, the loop terminates, and `tot` will hold the total count of trailing zeros in `num`.
    return tot
    #The program returns the total count of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer 'num', which is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `num` between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive and returns the total count of trailing zeros in its string representation.
