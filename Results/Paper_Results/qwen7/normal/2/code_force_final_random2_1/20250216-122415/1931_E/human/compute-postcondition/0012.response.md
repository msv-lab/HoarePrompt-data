Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `tot` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `tot` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
