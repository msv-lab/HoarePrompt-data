Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is `len(num) - 3`, `tot` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `num`, `i`, or `tot`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was inside. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values remain unchanged.
