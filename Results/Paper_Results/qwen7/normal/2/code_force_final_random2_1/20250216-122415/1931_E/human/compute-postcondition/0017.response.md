Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is `len(num) - 3`, `tot` is 3, and if `num[i]` is not '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `tot` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The condition regarding `num[i]` not being '0' and breaking out of the loop remains the same.
