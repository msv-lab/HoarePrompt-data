#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the sequence a where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100, and b is a list of integers representing the values n_i where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list 'a'
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns the list 'b' which consists of integers between 1 and 100, where each integer in list 'b' is less than or equal to 100 and the list 'a' (which is not returned but known to be strictly greater than 'b') contains integers in strictly increasing order between 1 and 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `a` and `b`, where `a` contains integers in strictly increasing order between 1 and 100, and `b` contains integers between 1 and 100. If the maximum value in `a` is less than or equal to the maximum value in `b`, the function returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in `a`. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.
