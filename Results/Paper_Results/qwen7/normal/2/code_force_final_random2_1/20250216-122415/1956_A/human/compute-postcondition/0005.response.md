Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, `a` and `b`, where `a` contains integers in strictly increasing order between 1 and 100, and `b` contains integers between 1 and 100. If the maximum value in `a` is less than or equal to the maximum value in `b`, the function returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in `a`. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.**
