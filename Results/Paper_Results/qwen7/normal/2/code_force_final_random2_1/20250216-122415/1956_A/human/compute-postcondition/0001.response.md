Output State: **The program returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list 'a'**

This means that for each integer in the list `a`, the program subtracts 1 from it and returns a new list with these updated values. Since the original list `a` contains integers such that \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_k \leq 100\), the resulting list will contain integers such that \(0 \leq (a_1 - 1) < (a_2 - 1) < \ldots < (a_k - 1) \leq 99\).
