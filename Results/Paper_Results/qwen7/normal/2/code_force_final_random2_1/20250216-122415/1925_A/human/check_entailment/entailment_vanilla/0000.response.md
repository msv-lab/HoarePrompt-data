Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - The function currently does not take any parameters; instead, it directly uses `input()` inside the function, which is incorrect because it should use the values passed from the outer loop.

3. **String Generation:**
   - The string `s` is initialized as `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`, which contains the first 20 lowercase English alphabets.
   - The function returns `s[:k] * n`, which means it repeats the first `k` characters of `s` for `n` times.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Function Signature:**
   - The function `func_1` should accept `n` and `k` as parameters since these values are provided by the input for each test case.

2. **String Construction:**
   - The current approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters are subsequences of `s`. It simply repeats the first `k` characters `n` times, which is not guaranteed to cover all possible subsequences.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to construct a string `s` that includes all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters. One efficient way to do this is to use a de Bruijn sequence, but for simplicity, we can also construct a string that ensures all subsequences are covered.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = ''.join(chr(ord('a') + i) for i in range(k))  # Generate the first k lowercase letters
    result = ''
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(k):
            result += s[j]
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` and `k`.

2. **Generate Initial String:**
   - Create a string `s` containing the first `k` lowercase letters.

3. **Construct Result String:**
   - For each position in the desired length `n`, append all `k` characters to the result string. This ensures that every possible subsequence of length `n` using the first `k` characters is included.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the input parameters and does not guarantee that all required subsequences are included. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work as expected.

**Correctness: False**
