Functionality: **The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from standard input, where \( n \) and \( k \) are within specific bounds. It then creates a string \( s \) containing the first 26 lowercase letters of the alphabet. The function constructs and returns a new string consisting of the substring of \( s \) from the start up to index \( k \) (inclusive), repeated \( n \) times.**
