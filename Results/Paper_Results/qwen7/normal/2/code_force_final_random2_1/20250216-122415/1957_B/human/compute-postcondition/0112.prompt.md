Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    if n == 1:
        print(k)
    else:
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        ans = []
        temp = 1
        while True:
            if temp * 2 < k:
                temp *= 2
                i += 1
            else:
                break
        ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
        ans.append(k - sum(ans))
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer; `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer. If `n` equals 1, there are no additional changes. Otherwise, `i` is either 1, 2, or 3, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing three elements which are (1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1), and 0, and `temp` is either 16, 8, or 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is a list with length `n`, `ans` is a list containing either three or two elements depending on the value of `n`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.), and the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is either a list with length `n` or an empty list, `ans` is a list containing either three or two elements depending on the value of `n`, `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.), and `i` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3. If `n == 1`, `arr` has length `n` and `ans` contains either three or two elements depending on `n`. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` contains two elements which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is either 1, 2, 4, or 8 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
