Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
