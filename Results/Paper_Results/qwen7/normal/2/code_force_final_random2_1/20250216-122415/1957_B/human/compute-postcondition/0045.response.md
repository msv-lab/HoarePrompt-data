Output State: **`l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing three elements which are `(1 << n) - 1`, `k - ((1 << n) - 1)`, and 0, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is either 16, 8, or 4, the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `k0 = k` simply assigns the current value of `k` to `k0`. This does not change any other variables or their relationships. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, `temp`, and the input conditions remain unchanged.
