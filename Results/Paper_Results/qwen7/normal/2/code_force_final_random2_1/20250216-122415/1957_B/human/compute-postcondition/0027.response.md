Postcondition: **`total` is not defined, `i` is 1 if `temp * 2 < k`, otherwise `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and either `temp` is 8 or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
