Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the case when \( n = 1 \) by simply printing \( k \).
2. For \( n > 1 \), the program constructs a sequence \( ans \) such that:
   - It includes at least one number with the highest possible number of 1s in its binary representation.
   - The remaining numbers are chosen to ensure the sum equals \( k \).
   - The rest of the numbers are set to 0 to meet the requirement of having exactly \( n \) numbers.
3. The logic inside the loop to determine the first element of \( ans \) is designed to find the largest power of 2 less than \( k \) and subtract it from \( k \). This ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s possible.
4. The program correctly outputs the sequence for each test case and handles the constraints appropriately.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic appears to be sound and should produce the correct output for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
