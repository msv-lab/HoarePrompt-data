Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is either 2 or 4 depending on the initial value of `temp` being 1 or 2, and the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was initially either 0 or 1, after executing `i += 1`, `i` will now be either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
