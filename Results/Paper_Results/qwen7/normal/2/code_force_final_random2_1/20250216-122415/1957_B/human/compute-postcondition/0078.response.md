Output State: **`l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is a list with length `n`, `ans` is a list containing either three or two elements depending on the value of `n`, `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.), `l1` is updated with the split input values.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` takes the list `l1` which contains split input values and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, l1)`. It then unpacks these integers into `n` and `k`. The value of `k0` remains unchanged and is still equal to `k`. All other variables remain in their initial state except for `n` and `k` which are now integers derived from the split input.
