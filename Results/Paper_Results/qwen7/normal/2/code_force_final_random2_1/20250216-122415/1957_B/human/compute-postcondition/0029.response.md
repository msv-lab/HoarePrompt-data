Output State: **`total` is not defined, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 16**.

Explanation: The code `temp *= 2` multiplies the current value of `temp` by 2. Given that the initial value of `temp` is 8 (as per the precondition), multiplying it by 2 results in `temp` becoming 16. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
