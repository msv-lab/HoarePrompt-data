Output State: **`l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing three elements which are `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, and 0, `temp` is either 16, 8, or 4, the input value for the next iteration is taken.**

Explanation: The code `l1 = input().split()` takes the input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to `l1`. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the first and second elements of `l1` respectively, after converting them to integers. The condition that `n` is not equal to 1 is preserved. The value of `k0` remains unchanged and is still equal to `k`. The lists `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged, as does the value of `temp`. The input value for the next iteration is taken, meaning the program is now waiting for further input.
