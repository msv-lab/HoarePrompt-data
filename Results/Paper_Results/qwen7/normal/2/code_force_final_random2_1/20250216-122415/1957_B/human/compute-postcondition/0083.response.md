Output State: **`i` is 0, `k0` is equal to `k`, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.).**

The code `ans = []` initializes `ans` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
