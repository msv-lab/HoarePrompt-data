Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `k0` is equal to `k`, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is either 2 or 4 depending on the condition `(temp * 2) < k`**.

Explanation: The variable `temp` is multiplied by 2. Initially, `temp` is either 1 or 2. After multiplying by 2, `temp` becomes either 2 (if initially 1) or 4 (if initially 2). The other variables remain unchanged.
