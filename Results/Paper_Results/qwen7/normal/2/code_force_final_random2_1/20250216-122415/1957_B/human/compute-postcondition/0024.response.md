Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 8.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
