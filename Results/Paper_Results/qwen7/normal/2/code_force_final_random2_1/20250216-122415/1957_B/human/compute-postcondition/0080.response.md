Output State: **`l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing either three or two elements depending on the value of `n`, `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.), `l1` is updated with the split input values.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `arr`. This does not affect the values of `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `ans`, `temp`, or the fact that `l1` is updated with the split input values. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged except for `arr` which is now an empty list.
