Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `i`: Either 0, 1, 2, or 3.
   - `k0`: Equal to `k`.
   - `l1`: Updated with split input values (not relevant for the print statement).
   - `n`: New integer from the first split value (part of `l1`).
   - `k`: Integer from the second split value (part of `l1`).
   - `arr`: An empty list.
   - `ans`: Contains two elements, which are \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - \text{sum(ans)}\).
   - `temp`: Either 1, 2, 4, or 8 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`.
   - `ans` is extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`.

2. **Calculating the elements of `ans`:**
   - The first element of `ans` is \((1 << i) - 1\). This is a bitwise left shift operation followed by subtraction 1. For example, if \(i = 2\), then \((1 << 2) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\).
   - The second element of `ans` is \(k - \text{sum(ans)}\). Since `ans` initially contains only one element, this simplifies to \(k - (\text{first element of ans})\).

3. **Extending `ans`:**
   - `ans` is extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`. Since `ans` initially has 2 elements, it will be extended by `[0] * (n - 2)` zeros.

4. **Final `ans` list:**
   - The final `ans` will have \(n\) elements. The first two elements are \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - \text{sum(ans)}\), and the rest are zeros.

5. **Printing `ans`:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the above, the output will be the first two elements of `ans` followed by zeros, with the exact values depending on the value of `i` and `k`.

Output: **[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1), 0, 0, ..., 0]** (where there are \(n-2\) zeros, and \(n\) is the length of `ans`)
