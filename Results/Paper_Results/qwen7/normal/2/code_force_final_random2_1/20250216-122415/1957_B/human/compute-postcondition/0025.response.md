Output State: **`total` is not defined, `i` is 1 if `temp * 2 < k`, otherwise `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no loop or if statement was specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the implied context. All other variables retain their initial states.
