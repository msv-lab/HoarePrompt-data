Based on the initial state provided:

- `l1` is updated with the split input values.
- `n` is the new integer from the first split value.
- `k` is the integer from the second split value.
- `k0` is equal to `k`.
- `arr` is a list with length `n`.
- `ans` is a list containing either three or two elements depending on the value of `n`.
- `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.).
- `l1` is updated with the split input values again (redundant information).

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of the variable `k`, which is the integer from the second split value of the input.

Output: **k (where k is the integer from the second split value of the input)**
