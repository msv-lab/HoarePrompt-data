Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all test cases provided in the input are processed. For each test case, the following conditions will hold true:

- `l1` will contain the split input values for the current test case.
- `n` will be the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and will not equal 1.
- `k` will be the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and will be equal to `k0`.
- `arr` will be a list with length `n`.
- `ans` will be a list containing either two or three elements depending on the value of `n`:
  - If `n == 1`, `ans` will contain `k`.
  - Otherwise, `ans` will contain `(1 << i) - 1`, `k - sum(ans)`, and possibly zeros to make its length equal to `n`.
- `k0` will be equal to `k`.
- `temp` will be a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.).
- `i` will be an integer that represents the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

After all iterations of the loop, the output state will reflect the processing of all test cases, with `t` (the number of test cases) being decremented to 0, and `ans` lists printed for each test case according to the rules described above.
