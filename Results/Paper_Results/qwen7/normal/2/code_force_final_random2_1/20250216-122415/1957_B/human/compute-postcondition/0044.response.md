Output State: **`l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing three elements which are `(1 << n) - 1`, `k - ((1 << n) - 1)`, and 0, `temp` is either 16, 8, or 4, the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `arr = []` initializes an empty list `arr`. This does not change the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains all the information from the initial state except that `arr` is now an empty list.
