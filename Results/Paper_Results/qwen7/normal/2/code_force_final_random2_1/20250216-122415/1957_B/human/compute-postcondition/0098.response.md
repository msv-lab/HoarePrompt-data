The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute as long as the program state allows it to continue. Therefore, we do not need to adjust any specific states to make the loop execute one more time. The loop will continue to run indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is either 0 or 1
- `k0` is equal to `k`
- `l1` is updated with the split input values
- `n` is the new integer from the first split value
- `k` is the integer from the second split value
- `arr` is an empty list
- `ans` is an empty list
- `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`

Since the loop is `while True`, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `k0` is equal to `k`, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`**
