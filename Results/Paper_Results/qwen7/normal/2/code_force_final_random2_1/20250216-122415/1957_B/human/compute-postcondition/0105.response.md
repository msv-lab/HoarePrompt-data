Output State: `i` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `k0` is equal to `k`, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 1, 2, 4, or 8 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have been incremented each time the condition `temp * 2 < k` was true, up to a maximum of 3 times based on the given information. Therefore, `i` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The variable `temp` will be doubled each time the condition `temp * 2 < k` is true, starting from 1. Thus, `temp` can be 1, 2, 4, or 8. All other variables (`k0`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
