State right before the while loop, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`i` is 0, `k0` is equal to `k`, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1**
