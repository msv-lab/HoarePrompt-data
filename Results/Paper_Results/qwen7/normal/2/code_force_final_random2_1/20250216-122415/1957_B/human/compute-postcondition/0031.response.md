Output State: **`total` is not defined, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the most internal loop or if statement has been broken out of. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial conditions.
