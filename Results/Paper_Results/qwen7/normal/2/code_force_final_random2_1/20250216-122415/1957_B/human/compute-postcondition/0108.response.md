Output State: **`i` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `k0` is equal to `k`; `l1` is updated with the split input values; `n` is the new integer from the first split value; `k` is the integer from the second split value; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` contains two elements which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`; `temp` is either 1, 2, 4, or 8 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`; `ans` is extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`**

Explanation: The line `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` extends the list `ans` by appending `n - len(ans)` number of zeros. Since `n` is the new integer from the first split value, the length of `ans` before this operation is 2 (as `ans` initially contains two elements). Therefore, `n - len(ans)` calculates the number of zeros to append to `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of other variables, so they remain as described in the initial state.
