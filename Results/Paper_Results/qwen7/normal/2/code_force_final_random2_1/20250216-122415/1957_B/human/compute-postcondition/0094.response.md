Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `k0` is equal to `k`, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is either 2 or 4 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`**

Explanation: The variable `temp` is multiplied by 2 (`temp *= 2`). Since `temp` was either 1 or 2 initially, after multiplying by 2, `temp` becomes either 2 (if it was 1) or 4 (if it was 2). The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
