Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition being true or false, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since no further operations are specified after the `break`, all the variables retain their previous values except that the loop or if statement is exited.
