Postcondition: **`l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is a list with length `n`, `ans` is a list containing either three or two elements depending on the value of `n`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.), and the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer.**
