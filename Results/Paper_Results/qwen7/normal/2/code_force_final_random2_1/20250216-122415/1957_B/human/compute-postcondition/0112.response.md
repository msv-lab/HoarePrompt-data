Output State: All test cases have been processed; `t` is now the total number of test cases; for each test case, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer; `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer; `k0` is equal to the original `k` for each test case; `arr` is either an empty list or a list of length `n` depending on the value of `n`; `ans` is a list containing either two or three elements depending on the value of `n`, where the elements are calculated based on the logic inside the loop; `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) for each test case; `i` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 for each test case, indicating the number of times `temp` was doubled before breaking the loop.

This output state describes the final conditions after all iterations of the loop have completed, with each variable reflecting its state after processing all test cases according to the given logic.
