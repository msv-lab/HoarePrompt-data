Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 4 since it is twice its original value and is currently less than `k`.**

Explanation: The value of `temp` is multiplied by 2, making it 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
