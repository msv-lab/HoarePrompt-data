Output State: **`i` is 1, `k0` is equal to `k`, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 2, and the current value of `temp * 2` is less than `k**.

This means that the variable `i` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
