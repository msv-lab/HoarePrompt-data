Output State: **`k0` is equal to `k`, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing either three or two elements depending on the value of `n`, `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.).**

The code `k0 = k` simply assigns the value of `k` to `k0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
