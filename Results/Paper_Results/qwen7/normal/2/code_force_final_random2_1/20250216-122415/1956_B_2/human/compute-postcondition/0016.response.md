Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros, `x` is 0, `ans` is increased by max(0, 0 - 1)**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `max(0, x - 1)`. Given that `x` is 0, the expression `x - 1` evaluates to `-1`. The `max(0, -1)` function returns 0 because 0 is greater than -1. Therefore, `ans` remains unchanged and is still 0. The states of the other variables (`a`, `cnt`, and `x`) are not affected.
