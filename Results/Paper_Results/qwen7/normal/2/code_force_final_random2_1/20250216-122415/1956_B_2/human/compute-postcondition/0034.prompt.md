Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `cnt` is a list of n+1 zeros, `x` is 0, `ans` is 10000, `n` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    cnt[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers that contains at least one element, `cnt` is a list of n+1 elements where the first element is 1 and all others are 0, `x` is 0, `ans` is 10000, `n` is an input integer

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers that contains at least two elements, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` elements where the first element is 1 and the second element is 1, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `ans` is 10000, `n` is an input integer

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers that contains at least two elements, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` elements where the first element is 1 and the second element is 1, `ans` is 10000, `cnt[x]` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
