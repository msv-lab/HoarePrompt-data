Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a:`. The variables involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `x` is initialized to 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. For the loop to start executing, the list `a` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the list `a`, we need to ensure that `a` contains at least one element. The other variables (`cnt`, `x`, `ans`, and `n`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the list `a` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must be a list of integers that contains at least one element, `cnt` is a list of n+1 zeros, `x` is 0, `ans` is 10000, `n` is an input integer**
