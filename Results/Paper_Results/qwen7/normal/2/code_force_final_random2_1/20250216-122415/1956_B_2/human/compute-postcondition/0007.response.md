Output State: **`line` is the sixth line in the original list; `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string stored in `line`.**

Explanation: The code `elements = line.split()` splits the string stored in `line` into a list of substrings based on whitespace (default delimiter). Since `line` is the sixth line in the original list, `elements` will be a list of strings resulting from this split operation. The initial state where `line` is the sixth line in the original list and `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` is the updated output state.
