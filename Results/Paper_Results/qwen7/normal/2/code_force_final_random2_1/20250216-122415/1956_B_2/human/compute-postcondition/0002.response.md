Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `line` is a string.
   - `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the string stored in `line`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - `{*elements}` creates a set from the list `elements`. A set contains unique elements, so it removes any duplicates.
   - For each unique item in this set, the code counts how many times it appears in `elements` using `elements.count(item)`.
   - It then performs integer division (`// 3`) on this count.
   - Finally, it sums up all these results and prints the sum.

4. **Precise Description**:
   - Let's assume `line = "abcabcabc"`. After splitting, `elements = ["a", "b", "c", "a", "b", "c", "a", "b", "c"]`.
   - The set `{*elements}` would be `{"a", "b", "c"}`.
   - For each item in the set:
     - `"a"` appears 3 times, so `elements.count("a") // 3` is `3 // 3 = 1`.
     - `"b"` appears 3 times, so `elements.count("b") // 3` is `3 // 3 = 1`.
     - `"c"` appears 3 times, so `elements.count("c") // 3` is `3 // 3 = 1`.
   - The sum of these results is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - Given the initial state and the operations described, the output will be the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique item in `elements` by 3.

Output: **3**
