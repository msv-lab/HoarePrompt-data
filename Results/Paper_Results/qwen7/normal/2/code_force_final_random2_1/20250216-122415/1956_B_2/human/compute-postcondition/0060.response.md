Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each key `x` in the dictionary `cnt`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is 0 + max(0, x - 1)
   - `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary
   - `x` is one of the keys in `cnt`

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to find another key `x` in the dictionary `cnt`.
   - Since `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary, there are multiple keys available.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `x` will be set to the next key in the dictionary `cnt`.
   - The value of `ans` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `ans` within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `ans` remains as 0 + max(0, x - 1) (unchanged from the previous iteration).
- `cnt` remains a non-empty dictionary.
- `x` will be set to the next key in the dictionary `cnt`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ans` is 0 + max(0, x - 1), `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary, `x` is one of the keys in `cnt***
