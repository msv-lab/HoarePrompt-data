You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        
        ans = 0
        
        for x in cnt:
            ans += max(0, x - 1)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every unique integer `x` found in all the lists `a` provided by the input, and `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary containing the frequency of each integer from all the lists `a`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the total sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every unique integer `x` found across all the lists `a` provided as input. The `cnt` list will no longer be modified since the loop has completed all its iterations, and it will contain the frequency of each integer from all the lists `a`. The initial state of `t` and `input` will remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies handling multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
