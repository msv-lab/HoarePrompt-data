Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `x`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
   - `a` is a list of integers that contains at least one element.
   - `cnt` is a list of `n+1` elements where the first element is 1 and all others are 0.
   - `x` is 0 (the value of `x` at the start of the current iteration).
   - `ans` is 10000.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a` to iterate over. Since `x` is set to the current element of `a` at the start of each iteration, the loop will continue until `x` is no longer assigned a new value from `a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `a`: Since `x` is set to the current element of `a` at the start of each iteration, the list `a` itself does not change within the loop. However, the value of `x` changes to the next element in `a`.
   - `x`: At the start of the next iteration, `x` will be set to the next element in the list `a`.
   - `cnt`: The list `cnt` remains unchanged within the loop.
   - `ans`: The value of `ans` remains unchanged within the loop.
   - `n`: The value of `n` remains unchanged within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be set to the next element in the list `a`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list of integers that contains at least two elements, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` elements where the first element is 1 and all others are 0, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `ans` is 10000, `n` is an input integer**.
