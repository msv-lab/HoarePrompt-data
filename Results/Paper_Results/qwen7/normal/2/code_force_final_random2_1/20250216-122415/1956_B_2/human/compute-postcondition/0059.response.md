Output State: **`ans` is 0 + max(0, x - 1), `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary, `x` is one of the keys in `cnt`**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `max(0, x - 1)` to its current value. Since `ans` was initially 0, the new value of `ans` is `max(0, x - 1)`. The dictionary `cnt` and the key `x` remain unchanged.
