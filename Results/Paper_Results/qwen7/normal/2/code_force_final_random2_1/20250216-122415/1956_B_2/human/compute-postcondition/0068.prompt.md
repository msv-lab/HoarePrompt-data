Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] += 1
    ans = 0
    for x in cnt:
        ans += max(0, x - 1)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros, `x` is 0, `ans` is 10000.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `cnt` list, which initially has 10001 elements all set to zero. For each iteration, the value of `x` is taken from `cnt`, and `ans` is incremented by `max(0, x - 1)`. Since `x` is always 0 (as it is taken from a list of zeros), `max(0, x - 1)` will always be 0 except for the last iteration when `x` becomes the last element of the list, which is still 0 but the loop will increment `ans` one last time. Therefore, `ans` will be incremented 10000 times, starting from 0, resulting in `ans` being 10000. The `cnt` list remains unchanged as no operation modifies its elements inside the loop, and `a` is not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is equal to the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in the list `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all keys `x` in `cnt`, `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary containing the frequency of each integer present in the list `a`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every unique integer `x` found in the list `a`. The variable `cnt` will still contain the frequency of each integer from the list `a`, but it will no longer be modified by the loop since the loop has completed all its iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
