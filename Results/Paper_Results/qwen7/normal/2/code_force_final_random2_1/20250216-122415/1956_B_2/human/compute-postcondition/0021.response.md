Output State: `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros, `x` is 0, `ans` is 10000.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `cnt` list, which initially has 10001 elements all set to zero. In each iteration, the value of `x` is taken from `cnt`, and `ans` is incremented by `max(0, x - 1)`. Since `x` is always 0 (as it's taken from a list of zeros), `x - 1` is -1, and `max(0, -1)` is 0. However, the description suggests that `x` changes to 0 in each iteration, implying that after each iteration, the value at the current index of `cnt` is decremented by 1 until it reaches -1, then `max(0, -1)` becomes 0, and no further change occurs. Given there are 10001 elements, after 10000 iterations, all elements in `cnt` will have been decremented to -1, and `ans` will have been incremented 10000 times, resulting in `ans` being 10000.
