Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element; `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[x]` by 1. Since `a` must contain at least one element, this precondition remains unchanged. The value of `cnt[x]` is updated by adding 1 to its current value.
