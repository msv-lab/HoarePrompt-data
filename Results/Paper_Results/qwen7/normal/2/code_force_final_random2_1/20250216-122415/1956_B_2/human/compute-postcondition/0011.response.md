Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing integers on cards, with each integer from 1 through n appearing at most twice. For each test case, the function processes the integers and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t` and a list of integers `a`. It processes these inputs according to specified rules and returns a result for each test case.
