Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ans` is equal to the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in the list `cnt`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `cnt` of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `ans`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while updating `cnt` to its new initialized state.
