Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', and `ans` will be equal to `6 * m` if none of the characters in `p` ('ABCDEF') are found in `hmp`. Otherwise, `ans` will be `0`.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `hmp` must contain the character 'F'. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. If `hmp[i]` is not less than `m`, no change is made to `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `hmp` must contain the character 'F', `i` is the next key in `hmp`. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. If `hmp[i]` is greater than or equal to `m`, no change is made to `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `hmp` must contain the character 'F', `i` is the next key in `hmp`, and `ans` is adjusted by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. If `hmp[i]` is not less than `m`, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
