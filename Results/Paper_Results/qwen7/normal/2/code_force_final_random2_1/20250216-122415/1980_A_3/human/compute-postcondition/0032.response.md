Output State: **`hmp` must contain the character 'F', `i` is the next key in `hmp`, `ans` is adjusted by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the result of `m - hmp[i]` to its previous value. The precondition that `hmp` must contain the character 'F' and `i` is the next key in `hmp` remains unchanged.
