Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly account for the requirement that each round must have exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). The current logic only checks for the presence of 'A' to 'F' and calculates the shortfall without considering the necessity of having at least one 'G' for each round.

To fix this, we need to ensure that for each round (which requires one problem of each difficulty level), we check if there are enough problems of each difficulty level. If not, we calculate the additional problems needed for each missing difficulty level and sum them up.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        # Check for each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'
        for i in 'ABCDEFG':
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected code ensures that for each difficulty level, it checks if there are enough problems available for `m` rounds. If not, it calculates the shortfall and adds it to the total count of problems that need to be created.
