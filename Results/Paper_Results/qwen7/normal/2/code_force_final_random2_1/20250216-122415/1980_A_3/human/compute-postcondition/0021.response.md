Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', and `ans` will be equal to `6 * m` if none of the characters in `p` ('ABCDEF') are found in `hmp`. Otherwise, `ans` will be `0`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over each character in the string `p` which is 'ABCDEF'. If a character is not found in `hmp`, `ans` is incremented by `m`. Since the loop runs 6 times (once for each character), if all characters in `p` are not found in `hmp`, `ans` will be incremented by `m` six times, resulting in `ans = 6 * m`. If any character is found in `hmp`, the corresponding condition will not be met, and `ans` will remain 0.
