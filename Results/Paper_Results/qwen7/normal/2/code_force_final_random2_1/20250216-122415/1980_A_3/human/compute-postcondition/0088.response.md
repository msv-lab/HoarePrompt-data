Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `p`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 'A'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEF'
   - If `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is equal to `m`

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 'A'.
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `p`, the next character in `p` would be 'B'.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be set to the next character in `p`, which is 'B'.
   - `p` remains the same as it is an iterable object (string) and not modified within the loop.

6. **Consider the postcondition**: The postcondition checks if `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is equal to `m`. However, since we are only adjusting the states at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to change `ans` or `hmp` unless explicitly stated.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEF'**
