Output State: **i is 'F', p is 'ABCDEF', ans is 6 * m, and hmp is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' each mapped to m.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over each character in the string `p` which is 'ABCDEF'. Initially, `hmp` is an empty dictionary. During each iteration, if the character `i` is not found in `hmp`, `ans` is incremented by `m`. As the loop progresses, each character from 'A' to 'F' is encountered and added to `hmp` with a value of `m`. The loop increments `ans` a total of six times (once for each character in the string 'ABCDEF'), resulting in `ans` being `6 * m`. By the end of the loop, `hmp` contains all the characters from 'A' to 'F' each mapped to `m`. The variable `p` remains 'ABCDEF' and `i` takes on the last value from the string, which is 'F'.
