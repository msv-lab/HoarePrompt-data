Output State: **`b` is a list of length `n` that must have at least one element, `v` is the second-to-last element of the list `b`, `p` is now `p * v`, `ans` is a list that now includes the value `p * v`, and `ans` also includes the new value of `p * v` which is `p * v`.**

This means that the list `ans` has been updated to include the value of `p * v` twice, reflecting the current value of `p * v`.
