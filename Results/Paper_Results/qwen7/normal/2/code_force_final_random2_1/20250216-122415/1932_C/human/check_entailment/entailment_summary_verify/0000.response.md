### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to process a series of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array `a`.
- For each command, we must output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m`.
- After processing a command, we remove the corresponding element from the array (leftmost for 'L', rightmost for 'R').

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`.
   - Computes the product of all elements in `b` and stores these products in reverse order in a new list `ans`.

2. **Issues Identified**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the product of the remaining elements in the original array `a` before appending to `b`.
   - Instead, it appends elements from `a` to `b` based on the commands, which does not reflect the requirement to compute the product of the remaining elements in the original array.

#### Correct Approach:
- We need to compute the product of the remaining elements in the original array `a` for each command.
- For each command, we should:
  - Compute the product of the remaining elements in `a`.
  - Output this product.
  - Remove the appropriate element from `a` based on the command.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`.
- It then computes the product of all elements in `b` and stores these products in reverse order in a new list `ans`.

Given the function summary, it seems the function is incorrectly designed to construct `b` and then compute the product of its elements, rather than maintaining the original order and computing the product of the remaining elements in `a`.

#### Example Verification:
Consider the example provided:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

- **Initial Array**: `[3, 1, 4, 2]`
- **Command Sequence**: `LRRL`

**Step-by-Step Execution**:
1. **First Command 'L'**:
   - Compute product of remaining elements: `1 * 4 * 2 = 8`
   - Output: `8 % 6 = 2`
   - Remove leftmost element: `[1, 4, 2]`

2. **Second Command 'R'**:
   - Compute product of remaining elements: `1 * 4 = 4`
   - Output: `4 % 6 = 4`
   - Remove rightmost element: `[1]`

3. **Third Command 'R'**:
   - Compute product of remaining elements: `1`
   - Output: `1 % 6 = 1`
   - Remove rightmost element: `[]`

4. **Fourth Command 'L'**:
   - Array is already empty, so no product to compute.

**Expected Output**: `0 2 4 1`

However, the given function produces:
- `4 2 8 0`

This discrepancy confirms that the function is not correctly implementing the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` before removing an element based on the command.

**Final: False**
