Output State: **`b` is a list of length `n` that must have at least one element, `v` is the last element of the list `b`, `p` is `p * v`**.

Explanation: The code `p = p * v` multiplies the value of `p` by the last element of the list `b`, which is `v`. The length of the list `b` and its other elements remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` remains a list of length `n` with `v` as its last element, and `p` is updated to `p * v`.
