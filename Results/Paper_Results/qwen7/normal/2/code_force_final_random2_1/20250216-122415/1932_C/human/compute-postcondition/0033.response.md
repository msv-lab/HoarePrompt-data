Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `v in reversed(b)`. This means the loop variable `v` is taking values from the list `b` in reverse order.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `b` is a list of length `n` that must have at least one element.
   - `v` is the last element of the list `b`.
   - `p` is `p * v`.
   - `ans` is a list that now includes the value `p * v`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**: In each iteration, `v` takes the next value from the list `b` in reverse order. Therefore, `v` becomes the second-to-last element of `b` in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `v` is the last element of `b` in the current iteration, in the next iteration, `v` will be the second-to-last element of `b`.
   - `p` will be updated to `p * v` where `v` is now the second-to-last element of `b`.
   - `ans` will include the new value of `p * v`.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Given that `b` has at least one element, and `v` is now the second-to-last element of `b`, `b` still has at least one element. The length of `b` remains `n` (since it hasn't changed).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `b` is a list of length `n` that must have at least one element.
- `v` is the second-to-last element of the list `b`.
- `p` is `p * v` where `v` is the second-to-last element of `b`.
- `ans` is a list that now includes the value `p * v` and the new value of `p * v` from the next iteration.

State: **`b` is a list of length `n` that must have at least one element, `v` is the second-to-last element of the list `b`, `p` is `p * v` where `v` is the second-to-last element of `b`, `ans` is a list that now includes the value `p * v` and the new value of `p * v`**.
