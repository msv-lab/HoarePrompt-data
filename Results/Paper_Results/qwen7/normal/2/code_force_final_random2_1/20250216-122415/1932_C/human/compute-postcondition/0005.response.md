Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list with one element `a[l]`.**

The code `b.append(a[l])` appends the value of `a[l]` to the list `b`. However, the initial state does not provide the specific value of `a[l]`, so we only know that `b` now contains `a[l]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `s[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
