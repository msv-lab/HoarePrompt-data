Output State: `b` is a list of length `n` with at least one element remaining, `v` is the first element of the list `b`, `p` is the product of all elements in the list `b`, and `ans` is a list containing the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `b` will have at most one element left (since each element is processed once), `v` will be the first (and possibly last) remaining element of `b`, `p` will be the product of all elements in the original list `b`, and `ans` will be a list containing each element of `b` multiplied by all the elements that came after it in the original list, in reverse order.
