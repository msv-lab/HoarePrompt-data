Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with one element from `a[l]` appended, `l` is increased by 1.**

The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. The initial values of `i`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `n` is still greater than 0, and `b` is still a list with one element from `a[l]` appended. The only change is that `l` has been incremented by 1.
