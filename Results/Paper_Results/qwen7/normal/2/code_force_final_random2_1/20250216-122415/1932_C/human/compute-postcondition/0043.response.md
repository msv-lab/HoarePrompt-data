Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the instructions in `s`. Then, it calculates the product of all elements in `b` and stores these products in reverse order in a new list `ans`. Finally, it returns the list `ans` containing the product of each element in `b` with all the elements that came after it in reverse order.**
