Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `b` is a list of length `n`, and `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ans`. The values of `i` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `n-1`, `b` is a list of length `n`, and `ans` is an empty list.
