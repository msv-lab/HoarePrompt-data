Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the first element returned by the lambda function `r()` which is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    print(b, 'B')
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will continue to execute until `u` becomes 0. After all iterations, `u` will be 0, `c` and `d` will be the return values from the last call to `r()` within the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `v` is `y - x`, `t` is `t - 4 * 3`, `a` has at least 5 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v, b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v), b[-1] + v + (v > z - y) * (b[-1] + v), b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-1] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v))]`, `c` is the return value of `r()` from the last iteration, `d` is the second return value of `r()` from the last iteration, `u` is false.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `u` will be false because it is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs, and it starts as the number of iterations required to reach the current state (which is at least 3). The values of `v` and `t` will be updated according to their respective operations within the loop, with `t` being reduced by 4 for each iteration. The list `b` will be updated based on its definition, but since no specific changes to `b` are mentioned in the loop body, it remains as described after the third iteration. Variables `c` and `d` will hold the return values of the last call to function `r()`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `u` is `False`, `c` is the first return value from function `r()`, `d` is the second return value from function `r()`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `u` is truthy. After the loop executes 3 times, `u` is set to `False` in the first iteration of the loop. Since `u` is now `False`, the loop terminates immediately without executing any further iterations. Therefore, the values of `c` and `d` remain unchanged from their values after the third iteration of the loop.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
