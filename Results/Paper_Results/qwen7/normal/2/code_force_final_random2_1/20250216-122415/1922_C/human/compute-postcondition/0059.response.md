Output State: `v` is `y - x`, `t` is `t - 2`, `a` must be a list with at least 4 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v, b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v), b[-1] + v + (v > z - y) * (b[-1] + v), b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v)), b[-1] + v + (v > z - y) * (b[-1] + v + (v > z - y) * (b[-1] + v))]`.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `v` remains as `y - x` because it is recalculated in each iteration but does not accumulate outside the loop. The variable `t` decreases by 2 for each iteration. The list `a` must have at least 4 elements to ensure the loop can run at least once. The list `b` grows with each iteration, adding new elements based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
