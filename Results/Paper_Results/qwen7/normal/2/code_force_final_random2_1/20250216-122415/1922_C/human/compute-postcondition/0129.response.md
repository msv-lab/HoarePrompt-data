Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t, an integer n, a list a of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, and an integer m representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two distinct integers x_i and y_i. The function returns results for each query based on the given conditions.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, where each test case contains specific parameters: the number of test cases `t`, the size of the list `n`, the list `a` itself, and the number of queries `m`. For each query, it takes two distinct integers `x_i` and `y_i` and performs some operation or checks certain conditions based on the elements in list `a`. However, the exact operation or condition is not specified in the given information, so the focus is on describing the structure and input requirements of the function.
