Output State: **`u` is the value of `u` decreased by 1; `c` is the return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`**.

Explanation: The variable `u` is initially set to its value decreased by 1. The code then calls the function `r()`, which returns two values. These values are assigned to `c` and `d` respectively. The initial state of `u` is updated, and the new values of `c` and `d` are derived from the function call.
