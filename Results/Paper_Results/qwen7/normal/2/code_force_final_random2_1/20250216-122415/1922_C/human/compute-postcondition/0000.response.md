Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a lambda function that maps input split into integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` that takes input from the user, splits it into multiple integers, and maps them to integers. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
