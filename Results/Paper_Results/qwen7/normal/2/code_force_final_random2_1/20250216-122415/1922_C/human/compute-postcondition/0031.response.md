The loop condition is `u`. For the loop to execute one more time, `u` must be non-zero (True) at the start of the next iteration.

Given the postcondition from the previous iteration:
- `u` is the value of `u` decreased by 1.
- `c` is the return value of `r()`.
- `d` is the second return value of `r()`.

We need to ensure that `u` is non-zero for the loop to continue. Since `u` is decreased by 1 in each iteration, the only way to guarantee that `u` is non-zero in the next iteration is to ensure that `u` was at least 1 in the current iteration.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `u` was at least 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`u` must be at least 1**
