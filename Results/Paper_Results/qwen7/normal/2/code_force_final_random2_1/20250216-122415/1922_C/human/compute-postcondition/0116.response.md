Given the initial state:
- `u` is `False`
- `c` is the first return value from function `r()`
- `d` is the second return value from function `r()`

The print statement is:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the expression inside the print statement:

1. `(d - 1) * 2`: This is the index used to access the element in the list `b`.
2. `(c - 1) * 2`: This is another index used to access another element in the list `b`.

Since the exact contents of the list `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the elements being accessed. However, we know that these indices are derived from the values returned by the function `r()`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the difference between the elements at the indices calculated from `d` and `c`.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]**
