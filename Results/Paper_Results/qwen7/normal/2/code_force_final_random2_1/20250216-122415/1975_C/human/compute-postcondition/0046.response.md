Postcondition: `max` is now equal to the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, which is greater than the original `max` value of 0, `i` is incremented to 2, `n` must still be at least 2, `t` is `t - 1`, the list `a` is updated with integers inputted by the user, and the current minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is greater than the new `max`.
