Output State: **`i` is 2, `max` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `max` to be the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[2]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]`. Therefore, `max` is now the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`. The values of `i` and the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 remain unchanged.
