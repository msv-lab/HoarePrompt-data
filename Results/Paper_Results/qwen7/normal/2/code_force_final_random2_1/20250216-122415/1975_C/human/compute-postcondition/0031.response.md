Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `max` is equal to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain at least 2.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `max` remains unchanged as it was determined based on the previous values of `a[1]` and `a[0]`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, and `max` is equal to the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[0]`**.
