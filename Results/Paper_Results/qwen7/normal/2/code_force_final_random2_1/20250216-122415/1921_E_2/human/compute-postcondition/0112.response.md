Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and conditions:

1. `t` is an integer.
2. `n` is `r[0]`.
3. `m` is either `r[1]` or `r[2]`.
4. `x1` is `x1 + a`.
5. `y1` is either `1` or `r[2]`.
6. `x2` is `x2 - a`.
7. `y2` is either `r[5] - a` or `y2 + a`.
8. `a` is either `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1`, or `m - y1` if `y2 < y1`.
9. `b` is `x2 - x1`.
10. `(x2 > x1 and x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n)`; this means `x1` and `x2` are within valid bounds.
11. `c` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2`.
12. Additional conditions: `b // 2 <= a` or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c` or `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m` or `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('draw')` will execute regardless of the specific values of the variables because it is a simple string literal.

Output: **draw**
