Output State: **`t` is the absolute value of `r[5] - 1`, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `y1` is `1`, `x2` is `x2 - a`, `y2` is `r[5] - a`, `a` is either `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1`, or `m - y1` if `y2 < y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `c` is `y2 - 1`, and `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is assigned the value of `y2 - 1`. Since `y2` is `r[5] - a`, `c` becomes `r[5] - a - 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
