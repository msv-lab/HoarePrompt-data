Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`: This means `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
   - `n` is `r[0]`: This means `n` is the first element of the list `r`.
   - `m` is `r[1]`: This means `m` is the second element of the list `r`.
   - `x1` is `x1 + a`: This means `x1` is updated to its original value plus `a`.
   - `y1` is `r[3]`: This means `y1` is the fourth element of the list `r`.
   - `x2` is `x2 - a`: This means `x2` is updated to its original value minus `a`.
   - `y2` is `r[5]`: This means `y2` is the sixth element of the list `r`.
   - `a` is either `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1`, or `m - y1` if `y2 < y1`: This means `a` is calculated based on the condition involving `y1` and `y2`.
   - `b` is `x2 - x1`: This means `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.
   - `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`: These conditions describe the relationship between `x1` and `x2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('draw')`.

Given the print statement and the initial state, the output will be a string literal "draw".

Output: **draw**
