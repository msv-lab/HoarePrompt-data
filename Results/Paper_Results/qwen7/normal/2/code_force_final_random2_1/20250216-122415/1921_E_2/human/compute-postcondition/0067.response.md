Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2] + 1 + a, `x2` is r[4] - a, `y1` is either r[3] + 1 or r[3] - 1, `y2` is either 1 or m, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. Additionally, `b // 2` is less than or equal to `a`, or the absolute difference between `x2` and `c` is less than `x1 + c`, or `y1` is not within the range [1, m], or `x1` is not within the range [1, n].
