Postcondition: `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `x2 - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `a` is either `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1`, or `m - y1` if `y2 < y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
