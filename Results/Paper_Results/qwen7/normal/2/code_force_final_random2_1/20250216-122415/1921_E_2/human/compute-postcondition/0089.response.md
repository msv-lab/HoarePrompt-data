Output State: **`t` is abs(y2 - y1), `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is x1 + a, `y1` is r[3], `x2` is x2 - a, `y2` is r[5], `a` is either y1 - 1 if y2 >= y1, or m - y1 if y2 < y1, `b` is x2 - x1**

Explanation: The code `x2 -= a` subtracts the value of `a` from `x2`. The value of `a` is determined based on the condition: if `y2 >= y1`, then `a = y1 - 1`; otherwise, `a = m - y1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
