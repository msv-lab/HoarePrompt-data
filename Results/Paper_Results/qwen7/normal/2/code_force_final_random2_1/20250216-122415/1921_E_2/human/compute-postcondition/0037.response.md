Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2] + 1, `y1` is either r[3] + 1 or r[3] - 1, `x2` is r[4], `y2` is r[5], `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y1` is less than `y2`; `a` is `m - y2`**.

This means that the value of `a` is updated to `m - y2`, while all other variables retain their initial conditions.
