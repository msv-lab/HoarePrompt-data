Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `r = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `r`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The precondition that the sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 is still valid, but since only one test case is being processed here, it doesn't affect the current state.
