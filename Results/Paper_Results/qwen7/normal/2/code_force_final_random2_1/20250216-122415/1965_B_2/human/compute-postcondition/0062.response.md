Output State: **`i` is 0, `idx` is -1, `n` is an input integer (unchanged), `k` is an input integer (unchanged), `nums` is a list containing elements `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`, and `idx` is updated to `i - 1` which is -1.**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `idx` is updated to `i - 1`, which results in `-1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and the list `nums` remain unchanged.
