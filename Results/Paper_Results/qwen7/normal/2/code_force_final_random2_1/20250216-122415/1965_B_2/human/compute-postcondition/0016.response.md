Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `idx = i - 1` updates the value of `idx` by subtracting 1 from the current value of `i`. Since `i` is initially 2, `idx` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
