Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes three values: t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), n (a positive integer between 2 and 10^6), and k (a positive integer between 1 and n). The function processes each test case and returns different outputs based on the values of n and k.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each containing specific integer values for `t`, `n`, and `k`. It processes these values according to some logic related to `n` and `k`, and returns a result for each test case. However, the exact nature of the output (what it returns) is not specified in the given information.
