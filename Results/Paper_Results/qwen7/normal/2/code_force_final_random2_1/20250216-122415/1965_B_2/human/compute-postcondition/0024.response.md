Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with an additional element `k - nums[2]` and `k + 1` appended to it, and `i` is equal to 21; `nums` now contains an additional element which is `k + nums[2] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 2, `nums[2]` is \(2^2 = 4\). Therefore, the new element added to `nums` is `k + 4 + 1 = k + 5`. All other variables remain unchanged.
