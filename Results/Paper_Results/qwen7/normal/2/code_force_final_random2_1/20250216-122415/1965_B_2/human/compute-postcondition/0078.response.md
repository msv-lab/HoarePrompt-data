Output State: **`i` is 20, `idx` is 19, `n` is an input integer (unchanged), `k` is an input integer (unchanged), `nums` is a list containing elements `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 1048576 + 1, k + nums[idx] + 1]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `nums` list, which is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Given that `idx` is 19, `nums[idx]` is `1048576 + 1`. Therefore, the new element appended is `k + (1048576 + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `k + 1048578`. This new value is added to the end of the list `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
