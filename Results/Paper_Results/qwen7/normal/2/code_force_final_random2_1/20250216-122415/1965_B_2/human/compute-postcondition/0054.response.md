Output: **len(nums) (where len(nums) is the number of elements in the list nums)**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `i` is 23 and `idx` is 21.
- It also states that `nums` contains an element equal to `k + nums[idx]`. However, the value of `k` is not explicitly given, so we cannot determine the exact value of this element in `nums`.
- The `print(len(nums))` statement will print the length of the list `nums`.

Since the exact number of elements in `nums` is not specified beyond the fact that it contains at least one element (the one described), the output will be the length of the list `nums`.
