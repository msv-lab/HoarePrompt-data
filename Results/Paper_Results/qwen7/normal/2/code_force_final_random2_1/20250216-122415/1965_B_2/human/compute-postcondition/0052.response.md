Output State: **`i` is 23, `idx` is 21, `nums` contains an element equal to `k + nums[idx] + 1`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `nums`. The new element is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Since `idx` is 21, the new element added to `nums` is `k + nums[21] + 1`. The values of `i` and `idx` remain unchanged. The condition about `nums` containing an element equal to `k - nums[idx] + 1` is no longer relevant since the list has been modified.
