Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with an additional element `k - nums[2]` appended to it, and `i` is equal to 21.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 2, the new element added to `nums` is `k - nums[2]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `i`) retain their values from the previous state, with `i` remaining at 21, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations.
