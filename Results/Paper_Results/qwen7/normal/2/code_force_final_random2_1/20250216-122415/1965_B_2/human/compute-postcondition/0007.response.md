Output State: **`idx` is `i - 1`, `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `idx = i - 1` assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Since `i` is initially 0, `idx` becomes -1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
