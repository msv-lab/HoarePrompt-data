Output State: **`i` is 20, `idx` is 19, `n` is an input integer (unchanged), `k` is an input integer (unchanged), `nums` is a list containing elements `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 1048576 + 1]`**

Explanation: The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Since `k` is an input integer, `k + 1` is also an integer. The list `nums` originally contains integers from 1 to `k - 512`. After appending `k + 1`, the list now includes all these integers plus `k + 1`.
