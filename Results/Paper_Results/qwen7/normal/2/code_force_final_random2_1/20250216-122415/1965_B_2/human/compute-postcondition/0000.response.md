Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is valid and non-negative.
   - The input value should be an integer because `int(input())` is used to convert the user input into an integer.
   - The input value should be within the specified range (1 <= t <= 1000).

3. **Consider Additional Constraints:**
   - Although the additional constraints (2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n) apply to the variables inside the loop body, they do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.
   - The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7, but this constraint is more relevant to the loop body rather than the loop head itself.

4. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value, which should be a valid integer within the range 1 to 1000.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000**
