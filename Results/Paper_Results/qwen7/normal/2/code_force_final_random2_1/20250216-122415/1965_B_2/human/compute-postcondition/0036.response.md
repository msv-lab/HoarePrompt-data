Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 20, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `i` and `idx`. Instead, it indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial conditions and the fact that no other operations are performed on `i` and `idx`, their values remain unchanged.
