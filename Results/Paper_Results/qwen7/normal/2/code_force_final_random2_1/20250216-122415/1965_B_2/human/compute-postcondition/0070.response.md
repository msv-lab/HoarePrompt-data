Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n` (though `n` is unchanged) and `k` (also unchanged). However, since `n` and `k` are unchanged, they don't need to be adjusted.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop condition is `for i in range(len(nums))`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `idx` is 0, `n` is an input integer (unchanged), `k` is an input integer (unchanged), and `nums` is a list containing elements `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.

4. **Next Iteration Check**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `nums`. The length of `nums` is 21. Since `i` is currently 1, it is indeed less than 21, so the loop can execute again.

5. **Adjusting the State**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`. It will be incremented by 1 from its current value of 1 to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `idx` is 0, `n` is an input integer (unchanged), `k` is an input integer (unchanged), `nums` is a list containing elements `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`**
