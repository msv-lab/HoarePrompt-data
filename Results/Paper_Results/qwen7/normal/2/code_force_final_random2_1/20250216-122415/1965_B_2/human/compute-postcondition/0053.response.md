Output State: **`i` is 23, `idx` is 21, `nums` contains an element equal to `k + nums[idx]`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 21, `1 << idx` equals `1 << 21`, which is 2097152. Since `nums` originally contained an element equal to `k + nums[idx] + 1`, after removing `2097152`, the remaining element in `nums` is now `k + nums[idx]`.
