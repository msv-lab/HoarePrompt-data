Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `idx` is -1
   - `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)
   - `i` is 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range of `len(nums)`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(nums)`.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

5. **Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(nums)`.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute again if `i < len(nums)`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 1.

7. **Other Variables:**
   - `idx`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`idx` is -1, `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `i` is 1**
