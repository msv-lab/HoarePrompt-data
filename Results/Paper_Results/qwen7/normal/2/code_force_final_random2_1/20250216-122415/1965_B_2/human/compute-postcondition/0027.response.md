Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `idx` is 2.
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000 (though its specific value is not needed for this problem).
   - `n` and `k` are input integers (their specific values are not provided, but they are used to construct the list `nums`).
   - `nums` is initially a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), which means it contains the numbers from 1 to 1048576.
   - Elements `k - nums[2]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[2] + 1` are appended to `nums`.
   - `i` is equal to 21.
   - `nums` does not contain the element `1 << idx` (which is 4).

2. **Constructing `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` starts with integers from 1 to 1048576.
   - It then appends three more elements:
     - `k - nums[2]`: This is `k - 4` because `nums[2]` is 4.
     - `k + 1`: This is just `k + 1`.
     - `k + nums[2] + 1`: This is `k + 4 + 1 = k + 5`.

3. **Final Structure of `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` will have the numbers from 1 to 1048576, followed by `k - 4`, `k + 1`, and `k + 5`.
   - Since `nums` does not contain the number 4, the number 4 is not present in the list.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(*nums)` will print all elements of the list `nums` separated by spaces.

Given the above, the output will be the list `nums` as described, with the specific elements mentioned.

Output: **1 2 3 5 6 ... 1048576 k-4 k+1 k+5** (where the ellipsis represents the numbers from 4 to 1048575 excluding 4, and `k-4`, `k+1`, `k+5` are the additional elements appended to the list).
