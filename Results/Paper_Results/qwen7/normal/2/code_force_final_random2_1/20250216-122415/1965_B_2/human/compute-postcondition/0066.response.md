Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < len(nums)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `idx` is -1 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `n` is unchanged
   - `k` is unchanged
   - `nums` is a list containing elements `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after incrementing it becomes 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged.
   - The list `nums` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be adjusted to 1.
   - `idx` remains -1 (unchanged).
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `nums` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `idx` is -1, `n` is an input integer (unchanged), `k` is an input integer (unchanged), `nums` is a list containing elements `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]**
