Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will execute `n-1` times, where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph. After all iterations, `i` will be `n-2`, `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing all pairs of integers \((u, v)\) that were input during the loop, `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `empty` is `True`, and `nodes` is a `defaultdict` where for each node `u`, `nodes[u]` contains a list of all nodes `v` that are connected to `u` via an edge, and vice versa. `leaves` is an empty deque.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `nodes` must contain at least one key. If the length of the list associated with the key is exactly 1, then the key is added to the `leaves` collection. Otherwise, no change is made to the `leaves` collection.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `nodes` must contain at least one key. If the list associated with the key in `nodes` has a length of 1, then `leaves` includes the next key in its list. If the list associated with the key in `nodes` does not have a length of 1, then `leaves` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `nodes` must contain at least one key, and `key` will be the next key in `nodes`; if the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, then `leaves` now contains the key that was appended. Otherwise, no change occurs in `leaves`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
