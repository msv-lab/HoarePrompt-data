Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, where each tuple (u, v) indicates an edge between nodes u and v, and `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `n` is updated to the integer input from the user, and `t` is updated to the integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `t` respectively. Since the initial values of `n` and `t` were defined as constraints, after reading the inputs, `n` and `t` are updated to the values provided by the user while maintaining their respective constraints. The other variables (`edges` and `start`) remain unchanged.
