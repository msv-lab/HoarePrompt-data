The function accepts the number of nodes \(n\) in a tree, the number of moves \(t\) (which is always 1), a list of edges representing the tree structure, and the starting node. It then identifies all leaf nodes in the tree and checks if the starting node can reach any other node in one move using the `func_1` function. If a move is possible, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'.
