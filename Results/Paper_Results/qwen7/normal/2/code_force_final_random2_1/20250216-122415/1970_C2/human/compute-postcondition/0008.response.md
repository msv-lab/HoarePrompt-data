Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `t` is 1.
   - `edges` is a list containing one pair of integers \((u, v)\).
   - `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\).
   - `empty` is `True`.
   - `nodes` is a `defaultdict` where `nodes[u]` contains the value `[v]` and `nodes[v]` contains the value `[u]`, and all other values are still empty lists.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, so the condition `i < n - 1` is satisfied if `n > 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain the same because the loop itself does not modify `n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one pair of integers \((u, v)\), `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a `defaultdict` where `nodes[u]` contains the value `[v]` and `nodes[v]` contains the value `[u]`, and all other values are still empty lists.**
