The function accepts a dictionary `nodes` representing a tree structure, an integer `start` representing the starting node index, and an integer `parent` representing the parent node index (default is None). It checks if any direct child nodes of the starting node have a distance that is not True when passed through the function. If no such child nodes exist, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True.
