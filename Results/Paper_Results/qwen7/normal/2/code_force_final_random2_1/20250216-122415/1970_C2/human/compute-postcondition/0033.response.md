Output State: **`start` is an input integer, leaves deque contains all the leaf nodes in the graph.**

Explanation: The code `start = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, storing it in the variable `start`. This operation does not affect the `leaves` deque, which still contains all the leaf nodes in the graph. Therefore, the `leaves` deque remains unchanged, and only the variable `start` is updated to hold the input integer.
