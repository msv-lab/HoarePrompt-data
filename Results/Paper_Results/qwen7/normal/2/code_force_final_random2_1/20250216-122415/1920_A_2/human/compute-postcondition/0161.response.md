Output State: **`no` is a list containing all elements `a` provided for each iteration of the loop, `num` is 0, `big` is a list containing all elements `a` where `x` is 1, `less` is a list containing all elements `a` where `x` is 2, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no specific changes are made to the variables within the loop due to the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the loop iteration.
