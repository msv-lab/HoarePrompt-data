Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of constraints where t represents the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n, an integer a in {1, 2, 3}, and an integer x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The function ensures there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes and validates these inputs according to specified rules but does not return any explicit value based on the provided information.
