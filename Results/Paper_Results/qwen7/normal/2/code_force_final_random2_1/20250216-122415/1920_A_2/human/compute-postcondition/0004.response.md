Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` must be at least 1; `less` is an empty list; `big` is an empty list; `no` is an empty list.**

The code `no = []` creates an empty list named `no`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `loop`, `less`, or `big`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
