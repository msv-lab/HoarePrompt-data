Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in no:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `no`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition states that if `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `i` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - The condition for modifying `i` involves the lists `less` and `big`.

4. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range defined by the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is an integer, it will either remain unchanged or decrease by 1 based on the given condition.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be within the range defined by `less` and `big`.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - If `i` was within the range and is now one less than its original value (because it was within the range), then `i` must be one less than the original value.
   - If `i` was outside the range and did not change, it remains unchanged.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the condition where `i` is one less than its original value if it was within the range, otherwise, it remains unchanged. However, since we don't know the exact original value of `i`, we can only express it in terms of the range conditions.

**State:**
- `i` is an integer.
- If `i` was within the range defined by the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`, then `i` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.
- The list `no` and the lists `less` and `big` remain unchanged.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can summarize the state as follows:

**State:**
- `i` is an integer.
- `i` is one less than its original value if it was within the range defined by the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.
- `no`, `less`, and `big` remain unchanged.

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume the original value of `i` was `x` and it was within the range. Then the state would be:

**State:**
- `i` is `x - 1`.
- `no`, `less`, and `big` remain unchanged.

If `i` was outside the range, the state would be:

**State:**
- `i` is `x`.
- `no`, `less`, and `big` remain unchanged.

Since we don't have the exact original value, we'll use the general form:

**State:**
- `i` is an integer.
- `i` is one less than its original value if it was within the range defined by the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.
- `no`, `less`, and `big` remain unchanged.

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is an integer. If `i` was within the range defined by the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`, then `i` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged. `no`, `less`, and `big` remain unchanged.**
