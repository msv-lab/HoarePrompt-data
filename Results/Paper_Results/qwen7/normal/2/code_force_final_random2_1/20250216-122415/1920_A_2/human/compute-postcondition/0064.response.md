Based on the initial state provided:

- `no` will be an empty list after all iterations of the loop.
- `num` will be the final value it reaches after all possible decrements based on the conditions given.

Since no specific conditions or loop details are provided to determine the exact value of `num`, we can only describe it in terms of the conditions given.

Output: **num (where num is the final value after all possible decrements based on the conditions given)**
