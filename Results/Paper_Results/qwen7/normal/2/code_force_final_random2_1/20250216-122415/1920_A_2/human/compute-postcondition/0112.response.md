Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `no` is a non-empty list.
- The first element `i` of `no` is either:
  - `i - 1` and satisfies being less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list.
  - Or `i` remains unchanged as the first element of `no`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in no:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `no`.
- The variable `i` takes on the value of each element in the list `no` during each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Condition**: `no` is a non-empty list.
2. **First Element `i`**: The first element `i` of `no` is either:
   - `i - 1` and satisfies being less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list.
   - Or `i` remains unchanged as the first element of `no`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since the loop iterates over each element in `no`, the only variable that changes within the loop is `i`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `no` must be considered.
- Therefore, `i` will take on the next element in the list `no`.

### New State:
- `no` remains a non-empty list (since it still contains elements).
- The first element `i` of `no` will now be the next element in the list.

### Conclusion:
- The new state should reflect the next element in the list `no` being considered by the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`no` is a non-empty list, and the first element `i` of `no` is either `i - 1` and satisfies being less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, or `i` remains unchanged as the next element of `no`.**
