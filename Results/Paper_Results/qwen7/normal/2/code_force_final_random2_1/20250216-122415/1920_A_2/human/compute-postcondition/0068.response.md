Output State: **`no` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `num` is the final value it reached after all possible decrements, `big` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The line `no = []` simply reassigns the variable `no` to an empty list. Since `no` was already an empty list in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. The other variables (`less`, `num`, and `big`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
