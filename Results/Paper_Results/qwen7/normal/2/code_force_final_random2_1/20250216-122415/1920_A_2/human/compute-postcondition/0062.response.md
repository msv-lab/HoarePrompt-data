Postcondition: `no` must contain at least one element; `i` is the next element in the list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`, then `num` is the previous value of `num` minus 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.
