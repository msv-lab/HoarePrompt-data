Output State: **`no` must contain at least one element; `i` is the next element in the list `no`; `num` is the previous value of `num` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code `num -= 1` decrements the value of `num` by 1. Since `num` was previously the next element in the list `no` (assigned to `i`), the new value of `num` is the previous value of `num` minus 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
