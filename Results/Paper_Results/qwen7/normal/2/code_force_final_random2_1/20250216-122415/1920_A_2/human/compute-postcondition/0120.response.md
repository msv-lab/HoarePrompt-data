Output State: **The list `no` is empty, `num` is less than or equal to its initial value minus the number of iterations (which is the length of the original `no` list), and `big` and `less` lists remain unchanged from their initial states.**

In this final state, all elements in the `no` list have been processed by the loop. Since the loop removes the first element of `no` each time it runs and the condition for running the loop is met as long as there are elements in `no`, once `no` becomes empty, the loop stops. The variable `num` is decremented each time the condition inside the loop is satisfied, which happens when the current element of `no` is within the specified range relative to `less` and `big`. After all iterations, `num` will be reduced by the number of elements originally in `no`. The lists `big` and `less` do not change because they are not modified within the loop.
