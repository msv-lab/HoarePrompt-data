Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2 during the loop iterations, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1 during the loop iterations, and `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 during the loop iterations. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then a new element `0` has been appended to the list `r`. Otherwise, `bx` is less than `ax`, `cx` is a non-empty set, `tmp` is 3, and `r` is a list with the value `(ax - bx + 1 - 3)`.
