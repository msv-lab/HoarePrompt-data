Output State: **`i` is an integer that is now one less than its original value, `less` is a list of integers with at least one element, `big` is a list of integers with at least one element.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, these conditions still hold true after decrementing `i` by 1, assuming the decrement does not violate these bounds. The lists `less` and `big` remain unchanged.
