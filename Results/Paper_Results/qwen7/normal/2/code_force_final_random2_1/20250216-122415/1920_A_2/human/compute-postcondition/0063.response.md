Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `no` will be an empty list, and `num` will be the final value it reaches after all possible decrements based on the conditions given.**

Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `num` each time an element in `no` satisfies the condition (i.e., `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`). Since the loop runs until `no` is exhausted, once `no` becomes empty, the loop terminates. At this point, `num` will have been decremented according to the specified condition for each valid element in `no`, resulting in its final value.
