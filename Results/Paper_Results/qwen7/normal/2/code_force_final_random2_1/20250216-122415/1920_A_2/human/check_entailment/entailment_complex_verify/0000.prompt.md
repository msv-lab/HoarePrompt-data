You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the list `no` will be empty, and the variable `num` will be the final value it reaches after all possible decrements based on the conditions given. The lists `less` and `big` will remain unchanged from their initial states.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a series of constraints. For each test case, it separates the constraints into three lists based on their types (big, less, no). It then calculates the difference between the minimum value in the 'less' list and the maximum value in the 'big' list, adjusting this difference by subtracting one for each value in the 'no' list that falls within the calculated range. Finally, it prints the adjusted difference for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the constraints include values that are not within the range defined by the minimum and maximum values from the constraints of types 1 and 2. Specifically, the program calculates the range between the minimum value from constraints of type 2 (`less`) and the maximum value from constraints of type 1 (`big`). However, it does not account for the possibility that the value `i` from constraints of type 3 (`no`) might fall outside this range but still be valid.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
Here, the constraints are:
- \( k \geq 3 \)
- \( k \leq 10 \)
- \( k \neq 1 \)
- \( k \neq 5 \)

The program correctly identifies the range as 3 to 10, excluding 1 and 5, resulting in the possible values 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, which gives 7 possible values. However, the program does not handle the case where the constraints include values that are not within this range but still valid.

Consider another input:
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 11
```
Here, the constraints are:
- \( k \geq 3 \)
- \( k \leq 10 \)
- \( k \neq 1 \)
- \( k \neq 11 \)

The program will incorrectly calculate the range as 3 to 10, excluding 1, but it does not exclude 11, leading to an incorrect count of possible values.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where the constraints include values outside the calculated range but are still valid.
