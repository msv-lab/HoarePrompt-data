Output State: **`no` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `big` is a list containing `a`, `x` is 1.**

The code appends the value of `a` (which is an input integer) to the list `big`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `big` now contains the single element `a`, while `no`, `less`, `num`, and `x` retain their initial values.
