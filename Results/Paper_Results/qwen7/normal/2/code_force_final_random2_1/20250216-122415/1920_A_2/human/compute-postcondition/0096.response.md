Output State: **`no` is a list, `less` contains the value 2, `num` is 0, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is equal to 1, or an empty list if `x` is not equal to 1, `x` and `a` are assigned the values from the input split into two integers, `less` now contains `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `less`. Since `less` was either an empty list or contained the value 2, after appending `a`, `less` now contains both 2 and `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
