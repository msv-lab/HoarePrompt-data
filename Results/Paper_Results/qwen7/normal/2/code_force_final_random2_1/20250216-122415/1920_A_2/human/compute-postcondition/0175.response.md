Postcondition: `i` is the next value from the list `no`, `no` remains unchanged, `less` remains unchanged, `big` remains unchanged. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not change the values of `i`, `no`, `less`, and `big`.
