Output State: **`no` is a list, `less` is either an empty list or contains the value 2, `num` is 0, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is equal to 1, or an empty list if `x` is not equal to 1, `x` is an integer input converted from a string, `a` is an integer input converted from a string, `iterable2` is increased by 1, `x` and `a` are assigned the values from the input split into two integers.**

In this output state, the variables `no`, `less`, `num`, `big`, `iterable2` retain their previous states. The variables `x` and `a` are updated to the integer values obtained from the input, split by space.
