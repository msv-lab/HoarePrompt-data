Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n, an integer a in {1, 2, 3}, and an integer x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the maximum and minimum x values and a set of unique x values within a specified range. If the maximum x value (bx) is greater than or equal to the minimum x value (ax), it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates and appends a specific value derived from the difference between ax and bx, minus the count of x values in a set that fall within the range [bx, ax]. The function returns a list of results for all test cases.**
