Output State: **`no` is a list, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing `a`, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `a` to the list `less`. Initially, `less` contains either 'a' (if `x` is 1) or 'a' (if `x` is 2). After appending `a`, `less` now contains two instances of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
