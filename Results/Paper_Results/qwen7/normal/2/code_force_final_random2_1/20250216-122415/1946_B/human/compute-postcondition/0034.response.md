Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k - 2` because `i` starts at 0 and goes up to `k - 2` (inclusive).

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is (((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD` + `t`) % `MOD`
   - `i` is 0
   - `t` is (2 * the maximum value that `tmp` could reach during the loop execution) % `MOD`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `t` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `t` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is (((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD` + `t`) % `MOD`, `i` is 1, `t` is (2 * the maximum value that `tmp` could reach during the loop execution) % `MOD`**
