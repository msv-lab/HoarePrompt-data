Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`. The state of `t` and `tmp` is updated based on the condition given.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`.
   - `tmp` remains unchanged if it was less than 0; otherwise, it remains the same.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `a`, the variable `x` will change with each iteration.
   - The variable `a` itself does not change within the loop; it remains the same list throughout the loop iterations.
   - The variables `t` and `tmp` are updated based on the current value of `x` in each iteration, but their values are not directly stated to be modified in the loop head.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The only variables that can be adjusted in the loop head are `x` and `a`.
   - Since `a` remains the same, we do not need to adjust it.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the list `a`.

Given that the loop is about to start its next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the list `a`, and `a` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`, `tmp` remains unchanged if it was less than 0, otherwise it remains the same, `x` is the next element in the list `a`, `a` remains the same**.

However, since the specific values of `t` and `tmp` are not changing in the loop head, we only need to focus on adjusting `x` and `a`.

Final State: **`x` is the next element in the list `a`, `a` remains the same**.
