Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input (using `sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()`) and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. These values are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `T` and `t` remain unchanged, and `MOD` stays as 1000000007.
