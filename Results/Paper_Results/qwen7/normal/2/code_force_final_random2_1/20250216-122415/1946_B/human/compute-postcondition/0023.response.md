Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `t` is 0**.

Explanation: The initial state sets `tmp` to be the maximum of 0 and the sum of its current value (which is 0) plus the next value of `x`. Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we consider its next value as an undefined variable. However, since `tmp` is set to 0 initially, the expression `0 + next(x)` will also be considered as an undefined value for the first iteration. Thus, `tmp` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and this undefined value, which remains 0. Similarly, `t` is updated to be the maximum of the new value of `tmp` (which is 0) and `t` (which is also 0), so `t` remains 0. The value of `x` is not specified, but it does not affect the initial state of `tmp` and `t` as they are both set to 0.
