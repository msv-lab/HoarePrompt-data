Output State: **`tmp` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the sum of its current value plus the next value of `x`; `t` is the maximum of the new value of `tmp` and `t`, `tmp` is increased by `x`.**

Explanation: The code `tmp += x` increases the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`. Then, `tmp` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the sum of its current value (which is now increased by `x`) and the next value of `x`. Finally, `t` is updated to be the maximum of the new value of `tmp` and the current value of `t`. All other variables remain unchanged.
