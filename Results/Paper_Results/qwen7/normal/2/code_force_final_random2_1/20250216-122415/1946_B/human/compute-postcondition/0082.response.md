Output State: **`i` is 1, `k - 1` must be a positive integer, `t` is 2 % MOD, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t` modulo `MOD`. Given the initial state, `t` is 2, so `t % MOD` will be 2 if `MOD` is greater than 2. Since the exact value of `MOD` is not specified, we keep it as `t % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
