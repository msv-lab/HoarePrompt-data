Output State: `i` is `k-2`; `k - 1` must be a positive integer; `t` is \(2^{(k-2)} \mod \text{MOD}\); `ans` is the sum of all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{(k-2)}\) modulo `MOD`.

To explain this in simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., when `i` reaches `k-2`), the variable `t` will hold the value of \(2^{(k-2)}\) modulo `MOD`. The variable `ans` will hold the sum of all numbers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{(k-2)}\) taken modulo `MOD`. This is because in each iteration of the loop, `t` is doubled and then taken modulo `MOD`, and `ans` is incremented by the current value of `t` and also taken modulo `MOD`.
