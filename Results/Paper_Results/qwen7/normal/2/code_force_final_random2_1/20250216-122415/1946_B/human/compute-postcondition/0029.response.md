Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(k - 1)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(k - 1)` generates values from 0 to `k - 2`.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < k - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
- `t` is the maximum value that `tmp` ever reached during the loop execution.
- `tmp` is 0 initially.

Since the loop will execute based on the value of `i`, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and that the loop will run for `k - 1` iterations. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `t` should be adjusted to reflect the maximum value `tmp` could reach during the loop execution. Since `tmp` starts at 0 and the loop will run `k - 1` times, `t` should be the maximum value `tmp` could theoretically reach over these iterations.

State: **`ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 0, `t` must be the maximum value that `tmp` could reach during the loop execution**
