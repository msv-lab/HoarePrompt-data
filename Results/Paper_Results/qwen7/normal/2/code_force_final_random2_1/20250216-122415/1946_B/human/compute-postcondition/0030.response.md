Output State: **`ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 0, `t` is 2 * the maximum value that `tmp` could reach during the loop execution**.

Explanation: The code multiplies `t` by 2. Since `t` was previously the maximum value that `tmp` could reach during the loop execution, now `t` is twice that value. The other variables (`ans` and `i`) remain unchanged.
