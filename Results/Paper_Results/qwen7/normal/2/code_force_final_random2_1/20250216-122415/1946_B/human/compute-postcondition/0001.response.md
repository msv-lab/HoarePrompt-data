Output State: **`T` is an integer read from standard input and stripped of whitespace, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `T`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was already defined in the initial state. The value of `MOD` remains 1000000007 as it is not affected by the code snippet.
