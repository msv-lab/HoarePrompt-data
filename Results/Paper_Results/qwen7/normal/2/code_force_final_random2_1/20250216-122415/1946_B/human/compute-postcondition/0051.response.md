Output State: **`ans` is \((s + t) \% MOD + t \% MOD\), `i` is \(k-1\), `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `t` is 0, `T` is \(T-1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from stdin, `tmp` is 0.**

Explanation: 
- The code initializes `t` to 0 and `tmp` to 0.
- The values of `ans`, `i`, `s`, `T`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- After executing the code, `t` is set to 0 and `tmp` is set to 0.
