Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is ((((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t % MOD) + t % MOD), `a` is an empty list, `tmp` is equal to `t`, `t` is 8 * t % MOD, `t` is `t` % MOD**

Explanation: The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t % MOD`. Since the initial value of `t` was 8 * t % MOD, the new value of `t` is `(8 * t) % MOD % MOD`, which simplifies to `8 * t % MOD` because `(a % b) % b` is equivalent to `a % b`. Therefore, `t` remains `8 * t % MOD` and is also updated to `t % MOD`. All other variables (`i`, `k`, `ans`, `a`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.
