Output State: **`tmp` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the sum of its current value plus the next value of `x`; `t` is the maximum of the new value of `tmp` and `t`, `tmp` is increased by `x`. If `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` becomes 0; `t` is the maximum of the new value of `tmp` and `t`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` and `t`. Since `tmp` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the sum of its current value plus the next value of `x`, and `tmp` is also increased by `x`, the value of `t` is now the maximum of the new value of `tmp` and the original value of `t`. The other conditions and the relationship between `tmp` and `x` remain unchanged.
