Output State: `ans` is (`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `t` % `MOD`, `i` is `k-1`, `t` is (2^(`k-1`) * the maximum value that `tmp` could reach during the loop execution) % `MOD`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (i.e., `k-1` times), the value of `ans` will be the sum of `s` and the accumulated value of `t` after each iteration, all taken modulo `MOD`. The variable `t` will be the result of doubling itself `(k-1)` times, starting from 0, and taking modulo `MOD` after each multiplication. The variable `i` will hold the value of `k-1` since it increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
