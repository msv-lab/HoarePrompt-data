Output State: **`ans` is (`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `t` % `MOD` and `ans` is taken modulo `MOD`, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The line `ans %= MOD` takes the current value of `ans` and updates it to be `ans` modulo `MOD`. Since the initial value of `ans` is (`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `t` % `MOD`, after applying the modulo operation, `ans` remains (`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `t` % `MOD` because taking a number modulo itself does not change its value. The variable `i` is not affected by this operation, so it remains 3.
