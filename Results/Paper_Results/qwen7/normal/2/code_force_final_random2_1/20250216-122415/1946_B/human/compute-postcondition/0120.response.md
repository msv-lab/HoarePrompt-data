Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop variable that starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `k` is a constant or a variable that determines the number of iterations the loop will run.

3. **Initial state given**:
   - `ans` is \(((s + t) \% MOD + MOD) \% MOD\)
   - `a` is an empty list
   - `tmp` is equal to `t`
   - `t` is the maximum value encountered during the loop execution (this is a post-loop condition, not an initial state)

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 initially.
   - `k` must be a positive integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:
**`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is \(((s + t) \% MOD + MOD) \% MOD\), `a` is an empty list, `tmp` is equal to `t`**

Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is \(((s + t) \% MOD + MOD) \% MOD\), `a` is an empty list, `tmp` is equal to `t`**
