Output State: **`ans` is (`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `t` % `MOD`, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding the current value of `t` to it. Since `t` is already given as `t % MOD`, the new value of `ans` becomes (`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `t` % `MOD`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged.
