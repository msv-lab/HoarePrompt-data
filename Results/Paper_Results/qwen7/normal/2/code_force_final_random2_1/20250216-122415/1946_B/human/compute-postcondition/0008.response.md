Output State: **`tmp` is the original value of `tmp` plus `x`.**

Explanation: The line `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`. Since the exact initial value of `tmp` is not specified, we express the new value of `tmp` as its original value plus `x`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.
