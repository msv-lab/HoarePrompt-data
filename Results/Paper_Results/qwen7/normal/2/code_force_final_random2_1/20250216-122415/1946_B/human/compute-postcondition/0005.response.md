Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third line of input, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
