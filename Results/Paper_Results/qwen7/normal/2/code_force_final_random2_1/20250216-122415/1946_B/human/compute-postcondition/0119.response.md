Output State: **`ans` is ((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD`, `a` is an empty list, `tmp` is equal to `t`, and `t` is the maximum value encountered during the loop execution.**

Explanation: The code calculates `ans` as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. This calculation does not affect the values of `a`, `tmp`, or `t`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states. The new value of `ans` is calculated based on the current values of `s` and `t`, and the constant `MOD`.
