Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third line of input, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    tmp += x
    if tmp < 0:
        tmp = 0
    t = max(tmp, t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tmp` is the maximum of its original value plus `x` and `t`, and if the current value of `tmp` is less than 0, then `tmp` is set to 0; otherwise, `tmp` retains its value as the original value of `tmp` plus `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tmp` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the sum of its original value plus `x`; `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tmp` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the sum of its current value plus the next value of `x`; `t` is the maximum of the new value of `tmp` and `t`, `tmp` is increased by `x`. If `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` becomes 0; `t` is the maximum of the new value of `tmp` and `t`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
