Output State: **`i` is 2, `k - 1` must be a positive integer, `t` is 4 % MOD, `ans` is 8 % MOD**

Explanation: The code `ans += t` adds the value of `t` (which is 4 % MOD) to `ans`. Since `ans` was initially 4 % MOD, adding `t` (4 % MOD) to `ans` results in `ans` being 8 % MOD. The values of `i` and `k - 1` remain unchanged.
