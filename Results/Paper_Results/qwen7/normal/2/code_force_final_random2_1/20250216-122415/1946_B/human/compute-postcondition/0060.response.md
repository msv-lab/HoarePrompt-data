Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tmp` is 0
   - `t` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. The variable `x` is used to iterate over the elements of `a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the elements of `a`, the variable `x` will take the next element from the list `a`.
   - The variable `tmp` and `t` are not directly affected by the loop itself, so they remain unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `tmp` remains 0.
   - `t` remains 0.
   - `x` will be the next element in the list `a`.

Given that the loop continues as long as there are elements in `a`, the state for the next iteration should reflect that `x` will be the next element in `a`, while `tmp` and `t` remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tmp` is 0, `t` is 0, `x` is the next element in the list `a`**
