Output State: `i` is `k-2`; `k - 1` must be a positive integer; `t` is \(2^{k-2} \% \text{MOD}\); `ans` is the sum of the first \(k-2\) terms of a geometric series with the first term 1 and common ratio 2, modulo MOD.

To explain further, after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., when `i` reaches `k-2`), the variable `t` will be \(2^{k-2} \% \text{MOD}\) because it doubles in each iteration starting from 0. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of these doubled values, modulo MOD, over the course of the loop. This sum forms a geometric series which can be calculated as \(\frac{2^{k-1} - 1}{1 - 2} = 2^{k-1} - 1\), but since we are taking modulo MOD, the exact value of `ans` depends on the specific value of MOD.
