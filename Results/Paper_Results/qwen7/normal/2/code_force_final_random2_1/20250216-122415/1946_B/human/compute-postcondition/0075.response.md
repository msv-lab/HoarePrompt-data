Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `k - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 (since `range(k - 1)` generates values from 0 to `k - 2`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < k - 1`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 0, and the condition `i < k - 1` should hold true.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `i` is initially 0 and that `k - 1` is a positive integer such that the loop can execute. The other variables (`tmp`, `t`, `x`, `ans`, `s`, `MOD`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `k - 1` should be a positive integer.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `k - 1` must be a positive integer**
