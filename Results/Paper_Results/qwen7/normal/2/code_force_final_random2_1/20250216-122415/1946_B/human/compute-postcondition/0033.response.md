Output State: **`ans` is (((`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `MOD`) % `MOD` + `t`) % `MOD`, `i` is 0, `t` is (2 * the maximum value that `tmp` could reach during the loop execution) % `MOD`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans %= MOD` performs a modulo operation on `ans` with `MOD`. This means that `ans` is updated to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`. Since the initial value of `ans` is given as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`, applying the modulo operation does not change its value because it is already in a form that ensures it is within the range `[0, MOD-1]`. The variables `i` and `t` remain unchanged.
