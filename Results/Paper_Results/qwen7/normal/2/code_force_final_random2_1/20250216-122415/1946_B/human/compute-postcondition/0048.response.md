Output State: **`ans` is \((s + t) \% MOD + t \% MOD\), `i` is \(k-1\), `t` is \((2^{(k-1)} \times \text{initial value of } tmp) \% MOD\), `T` is \(T-1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`. This does not modify the values of `ans`, `i`, `t`, or `T`. Instead, it assigns the input values to `n` and `k`. Therefore, these new input values are part of the current state. All other variables retain their previous values.
