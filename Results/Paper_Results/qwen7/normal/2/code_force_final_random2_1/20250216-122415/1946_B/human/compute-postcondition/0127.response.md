Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is (((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t % MOD), `a` is an empty list, `tmp` is equal to `t`, `t` is 4 * t % MOD, `t` is `t` % MOD**

Explanation: The line `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t % MOD`. This means `t` is now its remainder when divided by `MOD`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `ans`, `a`, `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
