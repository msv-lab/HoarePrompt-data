Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `tmp` is equal to the maximum of `tmp` and `t`.
   - If the current value of `tmp` is less than 0, then `tmp` is set to 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is being iterated over from the list `a`, the list `a` itself does not change in length or content during the loop. Therefore, `a` remains a non-empty list of integers.
   - The variable `tmp` could potentially be updated to the maximum of `tmp` and `t` during each iteration. However, since we are not given specific values for `t` or the exact update logic within the loop body, we can only assume that `tmp` might be updated but its value is not specified here.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the list `a`, which remains a non-empty list of integers.
   - The variable `tmp` might be updated, but without further information, we cannot specify its exact value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `tmp` is equal to the maximum of `tmp` and `t` (or it might be updated but its value is not specified)**.
