Output State: **`tmp` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the sum of its original value plus `x`; `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and `t`.**

Explanation: The code updates `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` and `t`. The value of `tmp` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the sum of its original value plus `x`. Since `x` is the next element in the list `a`, its value is not specified here, but it will affect the value of `tmp`. The value of `t` is now the maximum between its previous value and the new value of `tmp`.
