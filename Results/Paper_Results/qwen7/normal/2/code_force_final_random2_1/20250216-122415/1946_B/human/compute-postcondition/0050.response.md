Output State: **`ans` is \((s + t) \% MOD + t \% MOD\), `i` is \(k-1\), `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `t` is \((2^{(k-1)} \times \text{initial value of } tmp) \% MOD\), `T` is \(T-1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from stdin.**

Explanation: The code `s = sum(a)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `s`. All other variables (`ans`, `i`, `t`, `T`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
