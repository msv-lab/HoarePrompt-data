Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third line of input, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `t` and `tmp` to 0. It does not affect the values of the previously defined variables `T`, `MOD`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `s`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
