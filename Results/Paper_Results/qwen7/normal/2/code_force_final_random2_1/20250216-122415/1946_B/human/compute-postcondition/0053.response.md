Output State: **`tmp` is `x`, `a` is a list of integers read from stdin.**

Explanation: The code `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`. Since `x` is the first element of the list `a`, `tmp` is now equal to `x`. The list `a` remains unchanged, and its state is still a list of integers read from stdin.
