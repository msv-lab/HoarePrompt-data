Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `a` is a list of integers read from stdin, and the value of `tmp` is less than 0.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = 0` sets the value of `tmp` to 0. This does not affect the value of `a`, which remains a list of integers read from stdin. Additionally, the condition that `tmp` is less than 0 is still true after the assignment.
