Output State: `tmp` is 0, `t` is 0, `x` is the last element in the list `a`.

**Explanation:** After the loop has executed all its iterations, `tmp` will be reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and will accumulate the values of elements in the list `a`. However, since `tmp` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, it will never retain any value across iterations. Therefore, `tmp` will be 0 at the end of the loop. Similarly, `t` will also be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration and will only take the maximum value of `tmp` during the iterations, but since `tmp` is always reset to 0, `t` will also be 0 at the end of the loop. The variable `x` will be the last element in the list `a` because the loop processes each element of the list sequentially.
