Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l` to be the result of `func_2()` plus 1. Since `func_2()` is not defined here, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `l` is now one more than whatever `func_2()` returns. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `cnt`, and `l`) are updated accordingly based on the provided operations.
