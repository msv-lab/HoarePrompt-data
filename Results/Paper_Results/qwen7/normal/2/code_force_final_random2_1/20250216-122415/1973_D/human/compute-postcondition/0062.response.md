Output State: `i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is non-zero-1, `l` is `func_2()` + 1.

Explanation: Based on the provided information, after the loop executes 3 times, `cnt` is non-zero-1 (which means it's not zero but we don't know its exact value), and `l` is `func_2()` + 1. Since the loop condition `cnt and l < n + 1` must hold true for the loop to continue, and given that `n` is 1, the condition simplifies to `cnt and l < 2`. After 3 iterations, `l` is already `func_2()` + 1, which is greater than or equal to 2, making the loop terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, `cnt` will eventually become 0 or a negative number (non-zero-1), and `l` will remain `func_2()` + 1.
