Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the range function parameters. Specifically, the loop iterates over `range(n, 0, -1)`, so the relevant variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop variable that will take values from `n` down to 1 (inclusive).
   - `n` is the starting point of the range.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is less than 1, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the given states**:
   - The state before the loop starts is given as `v` is 1, `n` is the return value of `func_3()`, and `k` is the return value of `func_3()`.
   - Since the loop depends on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `v` and `k` are not directly related to the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted unless specified otherwise.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `v` and `k` remain as given.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`v` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the return value of `func_3()`**
