Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.
   - `cnt` must be non-zero (i.e., `cnt > 0`).
   - `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `k` must be 1.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `l` is `func_2()` + 2 and `l` is less than 3.

3. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The variables in the loop head are `cnt` and `l`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be non-zero (`cnt > 0`).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

5. **Current Values**:
   - `cnt` is 0, which means the loop condition `cnt and l < n + 1` fails because `cnt` is zero.
   - `l` is `func_2()` + 2 and `l` is less than 3. This implies `func_2()` + 2 is less than 3, so `func_2()` must be 0 or 1 (since `0 + 2 = 2` and `1 + 2 = 3` but `l` is strictly less than 3).

6. **Adjustment**:
   - To satisfy the condition `cnt > 0`, `cnt` must be adjusted to a non-zero value.
   - To satisfy the condition `l < n + 1` with `n` being 1, `l` must be less than 2 (since `n + 1` is 2).

### Final State Adjustment

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `cnt` and `l` as follows:

- `cnt` must be adjusted to a non-zero value (e.g., `cnt` can be set to 1).
- `l` must be adjusted to a value less than 2 (e.g., `l` can be set to 1).

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `l` must be less than 2**
