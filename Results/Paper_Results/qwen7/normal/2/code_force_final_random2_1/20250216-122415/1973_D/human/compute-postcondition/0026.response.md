Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n // k + 1):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - `v` is the return value of `func_2()`, but this variable is not used in the loop head.
   - `n` is given as 1.
   - `k` is the return value of `func_3()`.
   - `i` is given as 0.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `n // k + 1`.
   - Given `n = 1`, the condition `n // k + 1` simplifies to `1 // k + 1`.

4. **Analyze the Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `1 // k + 1` must be greater than 0.
   - This means `1 // k` must be at least 1, implying `k` must be 1 or less than 1 (but since `k` is a divisor, it cannot be zero).

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is already set to 0, it needs to be adjusted to start from 1.
   - `n` is fixed at 1.
   - `k` must be such that `1 // k + 1` is greater than 0, meaning `k` must be 1 or less than 1.

Given these points, the final state before the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1 or less than 1**
