Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 1, `l` is 2**

Explanation: The code `cnt, l = k, 1` updates the values of `cnt` and `l`. Initially, `cnt` is 0 and `l` is `func_2() + 1`. After the assignment, `cnt` is set to the value of `k`, which is 1. Since `l` is assigned the value 1, it is no longer `func_2() + 1`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged. The condition `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` was initially true, but now `cnt` is 1, and `l` is 1, making the condition false. However, since the question asks for the output state after the code execution, we only need to list the updated values of the variables.
