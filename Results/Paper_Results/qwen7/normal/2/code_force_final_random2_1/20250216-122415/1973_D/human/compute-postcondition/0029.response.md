Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 1
   - `k` must be 1
   - `cnt` is `k`, so `cnt` is also 1
   - `l` is 1

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `l` is 1
- `i` is 1

However, the variable `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `v` is not provided, we cannot determine its value directly from the given information. Therefore, we will leave it as `v`.

Given these values, the print statement will output:
- `l` which is 1
- `i * v` which is `1 * v` or simply `v`

So, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 v**
