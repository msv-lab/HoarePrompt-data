Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It performs a series of operations involving loops and function calls (`func_2` and `func_3`). Specifically, it prints queries and processes responses from `func_2`, aiming to find a specific condition where it can terminate early or continue until a certain count reaches zero. If a valid condition is met, it prints a result; otherwise, it prints `-1`.**
