Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and the condition `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` is true, and `func_2()` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `func_2()` is called, but since its implementation is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `l`. However, we know that `l` is initially `func_2() + 1`. The condition `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` remains true because `cnt` is still 0 and `n` is 1, making `n + 1` equal to 2. Since `l` is `func_2() + 1`, for the condition to remain true, `func_2()` must return a value that makes `l` equal to 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
