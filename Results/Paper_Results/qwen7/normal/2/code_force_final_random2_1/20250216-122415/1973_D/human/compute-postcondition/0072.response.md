Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `k` must be 1.
   - `cnt` is 1.
   - `l` is `func_2()` + 1 and `l` must be less than 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `l` is defined as `func_2()` + 1 and it must be less than 2. Since `l` must be less than 2, and `func_2()` returns an integer, the only possible value for `func_2()` is 0 (because if `func_2()` were 1 or any other positive integer, `l` would be 1 or more, which contradicts the condition that `l` must be less than 2). Therefore, `l = 0 + 1 = 1`.

However, there is a contradiction because `l` must be less than 2, but `l` is calculated as 1. This implies that the condition `l < 2` is satisfied, and `l` is indeed 1.

- `v` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. But since the code snippet does not provide a definition for `v`, and no value for `v` is given, we assume `v` is a variable that is not affecting the condition directly.

Given these details, the expression `i * v` simplifies to `2 * v`. Since `v` is not specified, we leave it as `2 * v`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? 1 2 * v'**
