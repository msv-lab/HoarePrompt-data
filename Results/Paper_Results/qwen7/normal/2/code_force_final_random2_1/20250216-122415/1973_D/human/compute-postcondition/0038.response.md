Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.**

The code `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l` by calling the function `func_2()` and adding 1 to its return value. However, since the actual return value of `func_2()` is not specified, `l` remains as `func_2() + 1`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
