Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `k` must be 1.
   - `cnt` is 1.
   - `l` must be less than 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know the following:
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `v` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value directly from the given information.
- `l` must be less than 2, but since it is not further constrained, we can assume any value less than 2, typically an integer or float. However, without more context, we'll keep it as `l`.

Given that `i` is 2, the expression `i * v` would be `2 * v`. Since `v` is not specified, we can only express it as `2 * v`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for `l` and `2 * v`.

Output: **'? [l] 2 * v'**
