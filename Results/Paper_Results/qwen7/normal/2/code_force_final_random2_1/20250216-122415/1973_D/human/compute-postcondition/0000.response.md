Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; both `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_3()`**.

This means that the function `func_3()` has returned new values for `n` and `k`, which are still constrained by the conditions 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The exact values of `n` and `k` depend on what `func_3()` returns, but they must satisfy the given constraints.
