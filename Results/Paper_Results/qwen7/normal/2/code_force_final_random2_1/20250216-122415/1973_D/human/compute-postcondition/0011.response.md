Based on the initial state provided:

- `v` is the return value of `func_2()`. Since the value of `v` is not explicitly mentioned, we cannot determine its exact value.
- `n` must be at least 1, so `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `k` is the return value of `func_3()`. Since the value of `k` is not explicitly mentioned, we cannot determine its exact value.
- `i` is `n-1`, so `i` is an integer that is one less than `n`.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

Here, `i * n` is the product of `i` and `n`. Since `i = n - 1`, we can substitute `i` with `n - 1`:

\[ i * n = (n - 1) * n \]

Therefore, the expression `i * n` evaluates to \((n - 1) * n\).

Output: **'? 1 (n - 1) * n' (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
