Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is `cnt` - 1, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.

The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1, but the exact value of `cnt` before the operation is not specified (only that it must be non-zero). The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
