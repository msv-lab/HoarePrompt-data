Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is 1
- `k` must be 1
- `cnt` must be non-zero
- `l` must be less than 2

We need to determine the values of the variables used in the `print` statement. The statement is:

```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 2
- `v` is not explicitly defined, but since it's part of the multiplication `i * v`, and there's no other information about `v`, we cannot determine its exact value from the given information alone.

However, the key point here is that `l` must be less than 2. Given that `l` is an integer (as it is typically an index or a count in such contexts), the only possible values for `l` are 0 or 1.

Since `l` must be less than 2, and without any additional constraints, we can assume `l` could be either 0 or 1. But since the exact value of `v` is not provided, we cannot fully determine the exact output.

Given the format and the constraints, the most precise answer we can provide is:

Output: **'? [l] 2*v' where l is either 0 or 1 and v is an unknown value**
