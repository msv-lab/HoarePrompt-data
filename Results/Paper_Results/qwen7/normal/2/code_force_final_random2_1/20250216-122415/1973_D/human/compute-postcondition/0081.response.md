Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` must be at least 1, `l` is `func_2()` + 1**

Explanation: The code `l = func_2() + 1` assigns the value of `func_2() + 1` to `l`. Since `func_2()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `l` is one more than the return value of `func_2()`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
