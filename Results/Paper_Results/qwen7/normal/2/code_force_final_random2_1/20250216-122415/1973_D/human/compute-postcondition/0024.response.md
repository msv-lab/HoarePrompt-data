Output State: **v is the return value of `func_2()` after the last iteration, `n` is 1 (since the loop decrements `i` from `n` to 1), `k` is the return value of `func_3()`, and `i` is 0 (as the loop runs until `i` reaches 1 and then decrements again).**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `v` will be the result of the last call to `func_2()`, `n` will be reduced to 1 because the loop starts from `n` and decrements down to 1, `k` will retain its initial value as it was not altered by the loop, and `i` will be 0 since the loop continues decrementing `i` until it reaches 1 and then one more decrement makes it 0.
