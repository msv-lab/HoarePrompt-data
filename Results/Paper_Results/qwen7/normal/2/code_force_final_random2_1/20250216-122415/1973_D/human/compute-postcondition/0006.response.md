Output State: **`v` is `i`, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the return value of `func_3()`**.

Explanation: The line `v = i` assigns the value of `i` to `v`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `v` is now equal to `i`, while `n` must still be at least 1 and `k` remains the return value of `func_3()`.
