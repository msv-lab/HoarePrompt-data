Based on the initial state provided:

- `v` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be at least 1, but its exact value is not specified.
- `k` is the return value of `func_3()`, but the function itself is not defined, so we cannot determine the exact value of `k`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

Here, `i` is not defined in the initial state, so it is unknown. Since `n` must be at least 1, let's consider the simplest case where `n = 1` for clarity. The value of `k` does not affect this print statement directly.

The print statement will output a string with the format `'? 1 [i * n]'`. Given that `i` is undefined, we can only express the output in terms of `i` and `n`.

Output: **'? 1 [i * n]' (where i is an undefined variable and n is at least 1)**
