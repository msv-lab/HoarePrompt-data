Postcondition: `v` is the return value of `func_2()`, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the return value of `func_3()`, `i` is `n-1`. If `v` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described above when `v` equals `n`.
