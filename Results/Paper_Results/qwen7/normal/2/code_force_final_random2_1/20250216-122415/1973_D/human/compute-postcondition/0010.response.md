Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `0` in steps of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `0`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `v` is the return value of `func_2()`
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `k` is the return value of `func_3()`

4. **Loop behavior**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than `0`.
   - If `v` equals `n` at any point, the loop breaks.

5. **Adjusting the state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n` (or some value less than `n` but still positive).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than `0`.
   - Since `i` decreases by 1 in each iteration, `i` will be `n-1` at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Maintaining other states**:
   - `v` remains unchanged unless `v` equals `n` and the loop breaks.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless the loop breaks due to `v == n`.
   - `k` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `v` is the return value of `func_2()`
- `n` must be at least 1
- `k` is the return value of `func_3()`

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`v` is the return value of `func_2()`, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the return value of `func_3()`, `i` is `n-1`**
