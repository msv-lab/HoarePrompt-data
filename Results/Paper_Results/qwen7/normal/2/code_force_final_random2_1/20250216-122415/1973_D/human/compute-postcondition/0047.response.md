Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 1
   - `k` must be 1
   - `cnt` is 0
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`
   - The condition `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` is true

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n // k + 1`.

4. **Evaluate the loop condition**:
   - Given `n` is 1 and `k` is 1, `n // k` is 1.
   - Therefore, `n // k + 1` is 2.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the condition `i < n // k + 1` (i.e., `1 < 2`) is true.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged, so `n` is still 1.
   - `k` remains unchanged, so `k` is still 1.
   - `cnt` remains unchanged, so `cnt` is still 0.
   - `l` remains unchanged, so `l` is still `func_2() + 1`.
   - The condition `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` must still be true for the loop to continue.

Given these adjustments, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and the condition `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` is true**
