Output State: **i is 0, n is 1, k must be 1, cnt is 0, l is func_2() + 1.**

Explanation: The loop runs as long as `cnt` is non-zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`. Given the conditions provided for the first three iterations, we can deduce that `k` must be 1 because the loop increments `l` until it reaches `func_2() + 1`, and since `n` is 1, `l` will eventually reach `func_2() + 1`. After the third iteration, `cnt` becomes 0 and `l` equals `func_2() + 1`, which means the inner while loop condition fails. Since the loop's outer condition (`i` in range(1, n // k + 1)) starts with `i` as 0 and decrements until it reaches 1, after the loop completes, `i` will be 0. Therefore, the final state has `i` as 0, `n` as 1, `k` as 1, `cnt` as 0, and `l` as `func_2() + 1`.
