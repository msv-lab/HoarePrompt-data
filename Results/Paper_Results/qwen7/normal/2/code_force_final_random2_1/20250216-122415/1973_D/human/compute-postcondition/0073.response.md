Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 1, `l` is `func_2()` + 2 and `l` is less than 3.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l` by calling `func_2()` and adding 1 to its result. Since `l` must be less than 2 initially, after adding 1, `l` will be `func_2() + 1`. Given that `l` must be less than 2, the new value of `l` will be less than 3 (since `func_2()` returns a non-negative integer). All other variables remain unchanged.
