Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, the first tuple in `cases` has valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b` corresponding to the first tuple are defined; `unique_a` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a` corresponding to the first tuple in `cases`; `unique_b` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b` corresponding to the first tuple in `cases`; `relevant_a` is a set containing all elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing all elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`.**

Explanation: The line `only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b` creates a new set `only_a` which contains all elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
