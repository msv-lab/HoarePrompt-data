Output State: **`results` now contains 'NO', `total_distinct` remains unchanged, `unique_a` is a set containing the elements of `a`, `unique_b` is now a set containing the elements of `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is now a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `both` remains unchanged, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`.**

Explanation: The code `only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a` creates a new set `only_b` which contains elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
