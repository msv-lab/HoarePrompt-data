Output State: **The program returns a list of strings, either 'YES' or 'NO', for each test case processed by the loop. Each entry in the list is determined based on whether more than half of the elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exist (i.e., their counts exceed `k // 2`), or if the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is less than `k`. If neither condition is met, the entry is 'YES'.**

This means that for each test case (n, m, k, a, b), the program checks the conditions specified and appends either 'YES' or 'NO' to the `results` list accordingly. After processing all test cases, the `results` list is returned, containing the outcome for each test case.
