Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, the first tuple in `cases` has valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b` corresponding to the first tuple are defined; `unique_a` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a` corresponding to the first tuple in `cases`; `unique_b` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b` corresponding to the first tuple in `cases`.**

Explanation: The code `unique_b = set(b)` creates a set `unique_b` which contains all the unique elements from the list `b` corresponding to the first tuple in the `cases` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
