Output State: The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, for each test case (n, m, k, a, b):

- If more than half of the elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exist (i.e., their counts exceed `k // 2`), the result for that test case will be 'NO'.
- If the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is less than `k`, the result for that test case will also be 'NO'.
- Otherwise, the result for that test case will be 'YES'.

All other variables (`unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `both`, `only_a`, `only_b`) will be recalculated for each test case but will not persist outside the current iteration. The final `results` list will include the outcome ('YES' or 'NO') for every test case processed by the loop.

In summary, the `results` list will contain the outcome for each test case after all iterations of the loop have completed, with no additional variables persisting beyond their scope within the loop.
