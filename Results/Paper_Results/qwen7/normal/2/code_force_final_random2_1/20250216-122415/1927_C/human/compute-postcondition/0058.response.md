Output State: **`results` now contains 'NO', 'NO'; `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `unique_a` is a set containing the elements of `a`; `unique_b` is now a set containing the elements of `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is now a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `both` is the intersection of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `total_distinct` as the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. This value replaces the previous value of `total_distinct`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial descriptions.
