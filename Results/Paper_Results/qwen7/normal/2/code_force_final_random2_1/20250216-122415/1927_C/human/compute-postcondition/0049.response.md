Output State: **`results` now contains 'NO', `total_distinct` remains unchanged, `unique_a` is a set containing the elements of `a`, `unique_b` is now a set containing the elements of `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is now a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `both` remains unchanged, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`.**

This means that the set `only_a` is created by taking the difference between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. All other variables remain in their original state.
