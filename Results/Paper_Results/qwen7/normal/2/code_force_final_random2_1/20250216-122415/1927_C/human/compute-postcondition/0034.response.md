Postcondition: **`only_a` is updated to contain all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` contains all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`; `total_distinct`, `unique_a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, and `both` remain unchanged. If the length of `only_a` is greater than `k` divided by 2, the results list now contains 'NO'.**
