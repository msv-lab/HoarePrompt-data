Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Extracting Data**: For each test case, it extracts the lengths of arrays \(a\) and \(b\), and the value of \(k\). It also reads the elements of arrays \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Filtering Relevant Elements**: It filters out elements from arrays \(a\) and \(b\) that are greater than \(k\), as these cannot be part of the chosen elements.

4. **Identifying Unique and Common Elements**:
   - `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` store elements from arrays \(a\) and \(b\) that are less than or equal to \(k\).
   - `only_a` and `only_b` store elements that are unique to \(a\) and \(b\) respectively.
   - `both` stores elements common to both \(a\) and \(b\).

5. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\), it is impossible to form the required set, so the result is 'NO'.
   - If the total number of distinct elements (from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is less than \(k\), it is also impossible to form the required set, so the result is 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it is possible to form the required set, so the result is 'YES'.

6. **Outputting Results**: The program outputs the result for each test case.

This logic accurately checks the conditions specified in the problem statement, ensuring the program's correctness.
