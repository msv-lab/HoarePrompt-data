Output State: **`results` is a list containing 'NO', `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, and `total_distinct` is assigned the value of the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, `unique_a` is a set containing the elements of `a`, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `cases`, `m` is the second element of the next tuple in `cases`, `k` is the third element of the next tuple in `cases`, `a` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `cases`, `b` is the fifth element of the next tuple in `cases`.**

Explanation: The code `unique_a = set(a)` creates a new set `unique_a` containing the unique elements of the list `a`. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `results`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `total_distinct`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, while `unique_a` is updated to contain the unique elements of `a`.
