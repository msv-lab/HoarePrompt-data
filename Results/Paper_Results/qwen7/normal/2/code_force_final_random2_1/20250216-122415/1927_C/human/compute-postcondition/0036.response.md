Output State: **`only_a` is updated to contain all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` contains all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`; `results` now contains 'NO'; `total_distinct`, `unique_a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, and `both` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the context, the variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not modify any variable values or add new conditions, so the output state remains as described in the initial state.
