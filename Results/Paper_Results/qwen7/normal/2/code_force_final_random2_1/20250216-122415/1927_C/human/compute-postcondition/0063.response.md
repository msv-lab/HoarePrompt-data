Output State: The `results` list will contain either 'NO' or 'YES' for each test case in the `cases` list, based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case, the sets `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` will be calculated according to the given logic. The variables `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `n`, `m`, and `k` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `total_distinct` will hold the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` for each test case.

In summary, the `results` list will contain the outcome ('NO' or 'YES') for each test case after all iterations of the loop have been executed, and the sets and other relevant variables will reflect the final state determined by the loop's logic for the last iteration.
