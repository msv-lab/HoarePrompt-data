Postcondition: **`results` is a list containing 'NO', `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, and `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`. If the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`, then `only_b` is updated to contain only those elements whose length is greater than `k // 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `only_a` and `only_b`.**
