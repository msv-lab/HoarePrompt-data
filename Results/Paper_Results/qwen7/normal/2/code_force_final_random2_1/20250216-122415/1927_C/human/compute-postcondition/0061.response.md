Postcondition: **`results` now contains 'NO', 'NO'; `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `unique_a` is a set containing the elements of `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing the elements of `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `both` is the intersection of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`. If `total_distinct` is less than `k`, we continue the loop or process; otherwise, no changes are made to these sets.**
