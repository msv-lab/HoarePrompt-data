Output State: **`results` is a list containing 'NO', `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `total_distinct` is assigned the value of the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, `unique_a` is a set containing the elements of `a`, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `cases`, `m` is the second element of the next tuple in `cases`, `k` is the third element of the next tuple in `cases`, `a` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `cases`, `b` is the fifth element of the next tuple in `cases`, `unique_b` is a set containing all elements of `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new set `relevant_a` which contains all elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated definition of `relevant_a`.
