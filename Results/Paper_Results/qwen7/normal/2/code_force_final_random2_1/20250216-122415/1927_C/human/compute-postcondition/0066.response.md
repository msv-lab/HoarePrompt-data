Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and a parameter `cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, m, k) representing the lengths of arrays a and b, and the number of elements to be chosen, respectively. The function returns a list of strings, either 'YES' or 'NO', for each test case. Each entry in the list is determined based on whether more than half of the elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exist (i.e., their counts exceed `k // 2`), or if the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is less than `k`. If neither condition is met, the entry is 'YES'.**
