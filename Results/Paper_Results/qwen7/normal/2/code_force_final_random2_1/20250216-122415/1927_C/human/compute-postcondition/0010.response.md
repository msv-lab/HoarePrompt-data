Output State: **`both` is a set containing all elements that are common to `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `results` is a list containing 'NO', `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, the first tuple in `cases` has valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b` corresponding to the first tuple are defined; `unique_a` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a` corresponding to the first tuple in `cases`; `unique_b` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b` corresponding to the first tuple in `cases`; `relevant_a` is a set containing all elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing all elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`; the length of `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` adds the string `'NO'` to the end of the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
