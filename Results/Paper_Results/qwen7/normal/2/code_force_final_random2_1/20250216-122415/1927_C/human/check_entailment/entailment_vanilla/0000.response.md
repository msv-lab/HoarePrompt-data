Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if it's possible to select exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from two arrays `a` and `b` such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the chosen elements.

2. **Key Points**:
   - We need to ensure that we can pick at least \( \frac{k}{2} \) distinct elements from each array.
   - We need to cover all integers from 1 to \( k \).

3. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the input and stores the test cases.
   - It defines a function `func_1` to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it:
     - Converts arrays `a` and `b` into sets (`unique_a` and `unique_b`) to get unique elements.
     - Filters out elements greater than \( k \) from these sets.
     - Identifies elements that are unique to `a` and `b` and those present in both.
     - Checks if the count of unique elements in either array exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \).
     - Ensures the total count of distinct elements across both arrays is at least \( k \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge cases where more than \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements are unique to one array.
   - It ensures the total distinct elements cover all numbers from 1 to \( k \).

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns a list of results for each test case, indicating "YES" or "NO".

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the code is sound and correctly implements the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
