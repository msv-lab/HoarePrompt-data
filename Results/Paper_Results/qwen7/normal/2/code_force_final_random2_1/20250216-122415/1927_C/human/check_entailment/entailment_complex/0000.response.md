Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly parses the input and stores the necessary data for each test case.
2. The function `func_1` iterates through each test case and performs the following checks:
   - It creates sets of unique elements from arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It filters out elements greater than `k` and identifies elements exclusive to `a` and `b` as well as common elements between them.
   - It checks if more than half of the elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceed `k // 2`.
   - It verifies if the total number of distinct elements (from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is less than `k`.
3. Based on these checks, the function appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the `results` list for each test case.
4. The logic implemented in the function matches the problem statement and the provided examples.
5. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the implementation.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
