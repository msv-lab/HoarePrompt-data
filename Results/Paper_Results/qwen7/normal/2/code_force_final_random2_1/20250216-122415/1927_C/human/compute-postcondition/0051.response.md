Output State: **`results` now contains 'NO', `total_distinct` remains unchanged, `unique_a` is a set containing the elements of `a`, `unique_b` is now a set containing the elements of `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is now a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `both` is the intersection of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`.**

Explanation: The code `both = relevant_a & relevant_b` calculates the intersection of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` and assigns it to the variable `both`. The intersection operation returns a new set containing only the elements that are present in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
