Postcondition: **`results` is a list containing 'NO', `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, and `total_distinct` is assigned the value of the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If `total_distinct` is less than `k`, the function does not update `only_b` to contain only those elements whose length is greater than `k // 2`.**
