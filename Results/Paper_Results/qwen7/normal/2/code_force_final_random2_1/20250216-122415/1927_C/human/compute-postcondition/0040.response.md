Output State: **`results` now contains 'NO', `total_distinct`, `unique_a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, and `both` remain unchanged.**

The `continue` statement in the given code does not modify any variable values or states. It simply continues to the next iteration of the enclosing loop (if there was one). Since no changes occur to the variables, the initial state remains unchanged.
