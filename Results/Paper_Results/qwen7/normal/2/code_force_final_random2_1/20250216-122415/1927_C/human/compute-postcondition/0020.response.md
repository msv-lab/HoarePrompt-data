Output State: **`results` is a list containing 'NO', `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, and `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, and `total_distinct` is assigned the value of the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, and `results` is now ['NO']**.

Explanation: The code appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`. The operations on `only_a`, `only_b`, and `total_distinct` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `results` now contains 'NO', and the values of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `total_distinct` remain as they were before the code was executed.
