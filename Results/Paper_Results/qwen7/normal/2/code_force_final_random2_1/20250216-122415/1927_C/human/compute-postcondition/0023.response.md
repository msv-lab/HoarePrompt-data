`results` is a list containing 'NO', `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, and `total_distinct` is assigned the value of the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. The code appends 'YES' to the `results` list. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing 'NO', 'YES', `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, and `total_distinct` is assigned the value of the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.**
