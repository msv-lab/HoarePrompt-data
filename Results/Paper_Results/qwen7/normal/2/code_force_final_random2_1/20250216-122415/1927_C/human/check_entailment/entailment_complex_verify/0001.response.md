### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays \(a\) and \(b\) such that all integers from 1 to \(k\) are included among the chosen elements.

2. **Key Points**:
   - We need to ensure that we can pick at least \(\frac{k}{2}\) distinct elements from each array.
   - We need to cover all integers from 1 to \(k\).

3. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the input and stores the test cases.
   - It defines a function `func_1` to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it:
     - Converts arrays `a` and `b` into sets (`unique_a` and `unique_b`) to get unique elements.
     - Filters out elements greater than \(k\) from these sets.
     - Identifies elements that are unique to `a` and `b` and those present in both.
     - Checks if the count of unique elements in either array exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\).
     - Ensures the total count of distinct elements across both arrays is at least \(k\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge cases where more than \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements are unique to one array.
   - It ensures the total distinct elements cover all numbers from 1 to \(k\).

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns a list of results for each test case, indicating "YES" or "NO".

6. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **Step-by-Step Execution**:
     - **Line 11-14**: Convert arrays `a` and `b` to sets to get unique elements.
     - **Line 15-18**: Filter out elements greater than \(k\) from the sets.
     - **Line 19-22**: Identify elements that are unique to `a` and `b` and those present in both.
     - **Line 23-25**: Check if the count of unique elements in either array exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\).
     - **Line 26-28**: Ensure the total count of distinct elements across both arrays is at least \(k\).
     - **Line 29-31**: Append the appropriate result ('YES' or 'NO') to the `results` list.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in the code is sound and correctly implements the requirements of the problem.
   - The code ensures that:
     - No more than \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements are unique to one array.
     - The total number of distinct elements is at least \(k\).

8. **Validation Using Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the function correctly processes each test case and returns the appropriate result based on the conditions specified.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Final: True**
