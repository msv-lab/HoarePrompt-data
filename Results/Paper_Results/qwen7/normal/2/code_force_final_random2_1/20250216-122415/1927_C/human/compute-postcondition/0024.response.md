Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` in the `cases` list. This means the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are the ones that can be adjusted.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as there are more tuples in the `cases` list. Therefore, the only thing that needs to change is the current tuple being processed.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'YES'
   - `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`
   - `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`
   - `total_distinct` is assigned the value of the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the next tuple in the `cases` list. This means the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` will change to the values of the next tuple in `cases`.

5. **Final state**: The state remains unchanged for `results`, `only_a`, `only_b`, and `total_distinct` since these are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**`results` is a list containing 'NO', 'YES', `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, and `total_distinct` is assigned the value of the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `cases`, `m` is the second element of the next tuple in `cases`, `k` is the third element of the next tuple in `cases`, `a` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `cases`, `b` is the fifth element of the next tuple in `cases`**.

State: **`results` is a list containing 'NO', 'YES', `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, and `total_distinct` is assigned the value of the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `cases`, `m` is the second element of the next tuple in `cases`, `k` is the third element of the next tuple in `cases`, `a` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `cases`, `b` is the fifth element of the next tuple in `cases`**
