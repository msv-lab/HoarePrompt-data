Output State: The value of `i` is `bets`; `bets` is a positive integer; `ans` is the concatenation of 'a[0]', 'a[1]', ..., 'a[bets-1]' with spaces in between.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `bets`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `bets` remains a positive integer as it was initially. The variable `ans` contains a space-separated string of the values of `a[0]` through `a[bets-1]`.
