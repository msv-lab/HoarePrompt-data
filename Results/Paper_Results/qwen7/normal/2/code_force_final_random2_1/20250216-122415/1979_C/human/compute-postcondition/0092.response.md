Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`
- `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for all `i`
- The values of `a` and `prod` remain unchanged except for the element at index `i`
- `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for all `i`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(bets):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `bets - 1`.
   - The loop does not directly modify `a` or `prod` (except through `a[i]`), but it does affect `sumo`.

2. **Determine the Next State:**
   - After the loop completes one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will change from its current value to `i + 1`.
   - `sumo` will be recalculated as the sum of `int(a[j])` for all `j` where `0 <= j < bets`.

### Updated State:
- `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`
- `sumo` is now the sum of `int(a[j])` for all `j` where `0 <= j < bets` (i.e., the sum includes the updated value of `a[i]`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated `i` and the recalculated `sumo`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[j])` for all `j` where `0 <= j < bets`, `i` is `i + 1`**
