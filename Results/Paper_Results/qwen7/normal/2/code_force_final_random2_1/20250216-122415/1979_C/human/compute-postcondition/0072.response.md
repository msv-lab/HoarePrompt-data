Output State: **`i` is 3; `bets` is a positive integer greater than 1; `ans` is 'a[0]' + str(a[1]) + ' ' + str(a[3]) + ' '**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3. The value of `bets` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The variable `ans` is updated by appending `str(a[i]) + ' '` to its current value. Since `i` is 3, `str(a[i])` becomes `str(a[3])`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `'a[0]' + str(a[1]) + ' ' + str(a[3]) + ' '`.
