Output State: The variable `i` is `bets`, `ans` contains the string representations of all elements in `a` separated by spaces, and no further changes occur since the loop condition (`i < bets`) is no longer satisfied after the last iteration.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `bets`. The string `ans` will contain the concatenation of all elements in the list `a`, with each element converted to a string and separated by spaces. No further changes will occur because the loop condition is no longer met (i.e., `i` is no longer less than `bets`).
