Output State: **`i` is 1, `sumo` is increased by the sum of the integer values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[1]`, `ans` is the string containing the values of `a[0]` and `a[1]` concatenated with two spaces, and `ans` is updated by adding the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string representation of `a[i]` (which is `a[1]` since `i` is 1) to the existing string in `ans` followed by a space. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
