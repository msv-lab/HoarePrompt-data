Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sumo` is 0, `t` is the same as before, `i` is 0, `bets` must be a positive integer, `prod` is multiplied by `a[bets]` three times, `ans` is the concatenation of 'a[0]', 'a[1]', and 'a[3]' with spaces in between if `sumo` is less than `prod * a[bets]^2`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    a[i] = prod // a[i]
    sumo += int(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a[i]' is updated to `prod // a[i]', the sumo is the sum of int(a[i]) for all i, the values of `a' and `prod' remain unchanged except for the element at index `i', sumo is the sum of int(a[i]) for all i.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[j])` for all `j` where `0 <= j < i`, and `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
