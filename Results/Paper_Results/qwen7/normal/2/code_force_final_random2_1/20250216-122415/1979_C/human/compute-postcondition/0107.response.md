Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `bets`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `bets-1`, and `ans` is the value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < bets`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `bets-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `bets`.
   - The value of `ans` should remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `ans` within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The only change needed is to increment `i` to `bets`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `bets`, `ans` is the value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i-1]` followed by a space**.
