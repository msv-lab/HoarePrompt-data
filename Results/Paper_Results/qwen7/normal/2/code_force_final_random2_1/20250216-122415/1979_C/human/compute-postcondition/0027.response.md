Postcondition: **`i` will be equal to `bets`, `sumo` will be increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]` + ... + the integer value of `a[bets-1]`, `bets` must be greater than 0, and `a[i]` will be assigned the value of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `bets`. Moreover, the sum of the elements in `a` from index 0 to `bets-1` is less than `prod`.**
