Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. The function returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for `t`, `n`, and the list `k_i`.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing the operations inside the function.
