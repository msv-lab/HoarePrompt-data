Postcondition: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `bets`, `sumo` will be increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]` + ... + the integer value of `a[bets-1]`, `bets` must be greater than 0, and `a[i]` will be assigned the value of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `bets`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function does not change `sumo` further. Otherwise, `ans` will contain a string of the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` concatenated with spaces.**
