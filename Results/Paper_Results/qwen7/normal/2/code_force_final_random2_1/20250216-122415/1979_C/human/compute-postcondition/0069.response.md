Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `bets`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `bets` is a positive integer (let's denote it as `b` where `b > 0`)
   - `ans` is 'a[0]' (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `bets`. Therefore, `bets` must remain a positive integer greater than 1.

5. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 1
   - `bets` must still be a positive integer (greater than 1)
   - `ans` remains 'a[0]' (unchanged)

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `bets` is a positive integer greater than 1, `ans` is 'a[0]'**
