Output State: **`a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[j])` for all `j` where `0 <= j < bets`.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the product of elements in array `a` up to the current index `i`.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 after the loop completes one iteration.
- The variable `sumo` is recalculated as the sum of `int(a[j])` for all `j` where `0 <= j < bets`, which includes the updated value of `a[i]`.
