Output State: **`t` is 0, `bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `prod` is equal to `a[1] * a[2]`**

Explanation: The code `prod *= a[i]` multiplies the current value of `prod` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1 and `prod` is equal to `a[1]`, after executing the code, `i` will be incremented by 1 (making it 2), and `prod` will be updated to `a[1] * a[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
