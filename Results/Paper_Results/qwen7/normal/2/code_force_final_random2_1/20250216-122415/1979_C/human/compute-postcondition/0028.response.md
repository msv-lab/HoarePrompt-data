Output State: **`i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]` + ... + the integer value of `a[bets-1]`, `bets` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `bets`, and `ans` is an empty string.**

This output state reflects that the variable `ans` has been initialized to an empty string, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state as described.
