Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `bets`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < bets`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop condition `i < bets` will be true if `bets` is greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.
   - The variable `sumo` does not change within the loop head, so its state remains the same.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `bets` must remain the same.
   - `sumo` remains unchanged from the previous state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]`, `bets` must be greater than 1**.
