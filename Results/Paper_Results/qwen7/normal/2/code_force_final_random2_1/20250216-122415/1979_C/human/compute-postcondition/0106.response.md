Output State: **`i` is `bets-1`; `ans` is the value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.**

This means that the variable `i` retains its value as `bets-1`. The variable `ans` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is `bets-1`) with a space, and this new value is assigned back to `ans`.
