Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is increased by 1, `s` is the value at `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value at `data[index]` to the variable `s`. Since `index` was already increased by 1, it remains increased by 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer. Therefore, the updated state includes `s` holding the value from the list `data` at the current index, which is `index + 1`.
