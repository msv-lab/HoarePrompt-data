### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common technique for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Loop Over Test Cases**: The program iterates over each test case, extracting the necessary values (`n` and `s`) for processing.
3. **Function Call**: The `func_1` function is called with the string `s` for each test case.
4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, it returns 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Given the problem statement, the key observation is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of coins facing up ('U'). Here's why:

- When a coin facing up is chosen, its two neighbors are flipped. This operation does not change the overall parity of the number of coins facing up.
- Therefore, the parity of the number of coins facing up remains invariant throughout the game.
- If the initial number of coins facing up is odd, Alice can always ensure she wins by playing optimally. Conversely, if the initial number of coins facing up is even, Bob can ensure he wins by playing optimally.

The provided function correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly determines the winner based on the initial state of the coins and the rules of the game. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
