Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by 10, `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' characters in `data[index]`, `results` list now contains 'YES', `s` is updated to be the value at `data[index]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' characters in `data[index]`**

Explanation: The code `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
