Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits the data into a list.
   - This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases where each test case has multiple lines of input.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of coins (`n`) and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It counts the number of coins facing up using `s.count('U')`.
   - If the count of facing-up coins (`num_up`) is odd, it returns `'YES'`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.

4. **Game Logic:**
   - According to the problem, the game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
   - The key observation here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins because she can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob, forcing Bob to eventually face a situation with zero facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob wins because he can always respond to Alice's moves in such a way that he leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for her, eventually forcing Alice to face a situation with zero facing-up coins.

### Verification:

Given the above logic, let's verify the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `UUDUD`
   - Number of facing-up coins: 3 (odd)
   - Output: `YES` (Alice wins)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `UDDUD`
   - Number of facing-up coins: 2 (even)
   - Output: `NO` (Bob wins)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `UU`
   - Number of facing-up coins: 2 (even)
   - Output: `NO` (Bob wins)

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description.

**Correctness: True**
