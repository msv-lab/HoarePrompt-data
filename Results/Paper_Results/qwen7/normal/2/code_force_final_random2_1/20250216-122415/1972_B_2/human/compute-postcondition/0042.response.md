Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `result` and `results`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the `results` list.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO'.
   - `result` is the first element of the `results` list.
   - `index` is equal to the total number of elements in the `data` list.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `n` and `s` are set according to the last iteration's values.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must still have elements.
   - Since `result` is currently the first element of `results`, the next element in `results` will become the new `result`.
   - Therefore, `results` should now be a list with at least one element (the second element from the previous list).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `results` is a list containing at least two elements (since the first element is already used).
- `result` is the second element of the updated `results` list.
- `index` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `t` remains 0 as it is not part of the loop head.
- `n` and `s` remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`results` is a list containing at least two elements, `result` is the second element of the list, `index` is equal to the total number of elements in the `data` list, `t` is 0, and `n` and `s` are set according to the last iteration's values.**
