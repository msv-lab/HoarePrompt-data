Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is increased by 2, `s` is the value at `data[index]`, `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' characters in `s` and is odd, and `results` now contains 'YES'.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `t`, `index`, `s`, and `num_up_coins` remain unchanged. The only new information is that `'YES'` has been added to the `results` list.
