Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6). The function processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on the given constraints.**

This means the function `func_2` indirectly accepts a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` and pairs of integers `n` and `m`. It processes these inputs according to the specified constraints and returns appropriate outputs for each test case.
