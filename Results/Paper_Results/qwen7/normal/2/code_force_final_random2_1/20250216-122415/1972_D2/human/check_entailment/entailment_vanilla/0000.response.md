Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

### Given Program Breakdown

#### Function `func_1`
This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.

```python
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)
```

#### Function `func_2`
This function processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.

2. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The outer loop runs from \(x = 1\) to \(\sqrt{n}\). This is an optimization to reduce the number of iterations since \(x \times x \leq n\).
   - The inner loop runs from \(y = 1\) to a value where \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\).

3. **GCD Check**:
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` checks if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime. This is necessary because the problem specifies that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) must be a multiple of \(a + b\).

4. **Count Calculation**:
   - The expression `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` calculates the number of valid \(b\) values for a fixed \(a = x\). This is done by checking how many multiples of \((x + y) \times x\) fit within the range \([1, n]\) and similarly for \(m\).

5. **Output**:
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Testing with Provided Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: \(1 \ 1\)
   - Expected Output: \(0\)
   - Explanation: No pairs \((a, b)\) exist since \(1 \le a \le 1\) and \(1 \le b \le 1\), but \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) cannot be a multiple of \(a + b\) for any pair.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: \(2 \ 3\)
   - Expected Output: \(1\)
   - Explanation: The only valid pair is \((2, 2)\) since \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\) which is a multiple of \(2 + 2 = 4\).

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: \(3 \ 5\)
   - Expected Output: \(1\)
   - Explanation: The only valid pair is \((3, 3)\) since \(3 \cdot \gcd(3, 3) = 9\) which is a multiple of \(3 + 3 = 6\).

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: \(10 \ 8\)
   - Expected Output: \(6\)
   - Explanation: Valid pairs include \((2, 2)\), \((3, 6)\), \((4, 4)\), \((6, 3)\), \((6, 6)\), \((8, 8)\).

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: \(100 \ 1233\)
   - Expected Output: \(423\)

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: \(1000000 \ 1145141\)
   - Expected Output: \(5933961\)
