Output State: **`x` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 8, `m` must be greater than or equal to 8, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cnt` by adding the minimum of two values to it. The first value is `n // ((x + y) * x)`, which simplifies to `n // (4 * 2) = n // 8`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `n // 8` will be 1. The second value is `m // ((x + y) * y)`, which simplifies to `m // (4 * 2) = m // 8`. Since `m` is also greater than or equal to 8, `m // 8` will be 1. Therefore, `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` will be 1. Initially, `cnt` is 1, so after executing the code, `cnt` becomes 1 + 1 = 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
