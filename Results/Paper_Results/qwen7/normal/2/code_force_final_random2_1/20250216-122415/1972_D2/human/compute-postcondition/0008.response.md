Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 3\), `_` is 3.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the value of `t` is effectively decremented by 1 because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. Therefore, after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `t` times), `t` will be `0`. The variable `_` will hold the value of the last iteration index, which is `t - 1`, so it will be `t - 1 = 3` if the loop ran `t` times. Given that the loop can run a maximum of `t` times, and `t` starts at a maximum of \(10^4\), after running `t` times, `t` will be `0`. Thus, `t` is an integer between `0` and \(10^4 - 3\), and `_` is `3`.
