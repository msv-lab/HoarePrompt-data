Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\).

2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are \(x\), \(y\), \(n\), and \(m\).

3. **Analyze the loop body**: The loop body increments `y` by 1. The increment of `y` does not directly affect the loop condition, but it could change the values of \((x + y) \times x\) and \((x + y) \times y\).

4. **Check the loop condition after the last iteration**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `y` has been incremented by 1.
   - We need to ensure that both conditions \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\) hold true for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `y` has been incremented by 1, we need to check if the new value of \(y\) still satisfies the loop condition.
   - The new value of \(y\) is \(y + 1\).
   - We need to ensure that \((x + (y + 1)) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + (y + 1)) \times (y + 1) \leq m\).

6. **Formulate the answer**:
   - The variables in the loop head are \(x\), \(y\), \(n\), and \(m\). We need to ensure that the loop condition holds true for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can continue.

**Answer**:
State: **`cnt` is increased by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1; `y` is increased by 1, and \((x + (y + 1)) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + (y + 1)) \times (y + 1) \leq m\)**.
