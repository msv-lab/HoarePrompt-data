The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\).

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be 2.

Since `t` is unchanged and `_` is the only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment, the state remains the same regarding `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `_` is 2**
