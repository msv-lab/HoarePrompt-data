Output State: `x` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 6, `cnt` is 8, `y` is 5.

Explanation: Based on the given information, we can see that the loop continues as long as `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. The gcd condition and the addition of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` to `cnt` occur within the loop. After 3 iterations, `y` is 4, and `cnt` is 4. For the next iteration, `y` will be incremented to 5. Given the pattern in the provided outputs, it seems that `n` and `m` were adjusted to meet the conditions of the loop, but since no specific values for `n` and `m` beyond the minimum required are provided, we assume they remain at their minimum values that allowed the loop to run 3 times. Since `cnt` was 4 after 3 iterations and each iteration adds up the minimum values from `n` and `m`, the next two iterations would add `min(n // 9, m // 20)` and `min(n // 10, m // 24)` to `cnt`. Assuming `n` is just above 3 and `m` is just above 6, the additions to `cnt` would be small integers, leading to a total of 8 after 5 iterations. Thus, `y` becomes 5 after 4 iterations and the loop terminates after the 5th iteration with `cnt` being 8.
