Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `_` is 1**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since the function definition is not provided, no changes are made to the variables `t` and `_`. Therefore, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged from their initial states.
