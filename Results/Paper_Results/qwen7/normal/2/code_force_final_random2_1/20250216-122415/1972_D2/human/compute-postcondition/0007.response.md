Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 3\), `_` is 3.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1 because `_` starts from 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced by the total number of iterations, which is `t` itself. Since the loop runs `t` times, `t` will become `0` when the loop finishes, and `_` will be equal to `t` which is the total number of iterations, i.e., `3`.
