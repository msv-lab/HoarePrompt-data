Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `_` (which is a placeholder variable used for iteration) and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and `_` is 1.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` was initially an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it will still be greater than 0 after one iteration (assuming no side effects change its value).

4. **Update the state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `t`. After one iteration, `t` will be decremented by 1. Therefore, `t` will now be an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\).

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `_` is 1**
