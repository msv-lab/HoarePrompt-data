Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by the minimum value between `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. The initial conditions for `x` remain unchanged: \( x \leq \min(n / (x + 1), m - 1) \) and the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \) is 1. The values of `n` and `m` are also not directly modified by this operation, but their division results are used in the calculation.
