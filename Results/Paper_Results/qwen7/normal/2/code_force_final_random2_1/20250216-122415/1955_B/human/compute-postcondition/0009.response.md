Output State: `k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 2 (or any value from 0 to n-1 depending on when the loop stops), `li` is a list containing the values `a + k * c + d * h` for each `h` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. This list can be represented as `[a, a+d, a+2d, ..., a+(n-1)d]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `li` will be a list starting with `a` and increasing by `d` for each subsequent element, up to `n` elements in total.
