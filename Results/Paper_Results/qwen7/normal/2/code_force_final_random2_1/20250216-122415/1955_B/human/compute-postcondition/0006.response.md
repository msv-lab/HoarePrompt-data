Output State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 1, `li` is a list containing the value `a + 0 * c + 1 * d`, which simplifies to `a + d`.**

In this state, the list `li` now contains the value `a + d` instead of just `a`, since `k` is 0 and `h` is 1, making the expression `a + k * c + d * h` equal to `a + d`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
