Reasoning:

1. The problem requires checking if a given array `l` can form a progressive square with specified parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.
2. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the expected sequence of numbers for the progressive square and compare it with the given array `l`.
3. The function starts by finding the minimum value in the array `l` and then generates the expected sequence using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` where `a` is the minimum value.
4. Both the generated sequence `li` and the input array `l` are sorted before comparison.
5. If the sorted sequences match, it returns 'yes', otherwise 'no'.

Let's analyze the correctness of the program:

- The function correctly identifies the minimum value in the array `l`.
- It correctly generates the expected sequence using the given formula.
- The sorting step ensures that the comparison is done correctly regardless of the initial order of elements in `l`.
- The comparison logic is correct and returns the appropriate result ('yes' or 'no').

Given this analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and should work as intended for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
