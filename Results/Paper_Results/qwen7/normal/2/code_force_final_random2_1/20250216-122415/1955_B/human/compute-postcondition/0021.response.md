Output State: `k` is equal to `n`, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is `n-1`, `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and `li` has been fully populated with `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has executed `n` times. The variable `h` will be `n-1`, indicating it has gone through all values from 0 to `n-1`. The list `li` will contain `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
