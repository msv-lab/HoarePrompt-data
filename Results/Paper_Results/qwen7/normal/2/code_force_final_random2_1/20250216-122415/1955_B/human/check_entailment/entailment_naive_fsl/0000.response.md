Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the elements in the array `l` do not form a valid progressive square. Specifically, the program assumes that the smallest element in the array `l` corresponds to \(a_{1,1}\), but this might not always be the case. 

Consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  3 2 3
  6 9 3 5 7 1 10 4 8
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The program will incorrectly return "YES" because it sorts the array and checks if it matches the generated sequence, without verifying that the smallest element in the sorted array corresponds to \(a_{1,1}\).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the smallest element in the array `l` is indeed \(a_{1,1}\) before proceeding with the comparison. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    # Find the minimum value in the list
    a = min(l)
    
    # Generate the progressive square
    li = []
    for k in range(n):
        for h in range(n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    
    # Sort both lists for comparison
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    
    # Check if the sorted list matches the generated sequence
    if l == li:
        return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))
```

This corrected version ensures that the smallest element in the array `l` is correctly identified as \(a_{1,1}\) before comparing the sorted arrays.
