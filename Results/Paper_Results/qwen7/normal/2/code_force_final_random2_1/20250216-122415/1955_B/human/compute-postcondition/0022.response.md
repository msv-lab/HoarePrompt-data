Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for k in range(0, n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration:
     - `k` is equal to `n`.
     - `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive.
     - `h` is `n-1`.
     - `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and `li` has been fully populated with `n` elements.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `k` is currently equal to `n`, the loop condition `k < n` will be false, and the loop will not execute again.
   - Therefore, no changes are needed for `k` or `n` because the loop will not proceed to the next iteration.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop will not execute again, the states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is `n-1`, `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and `li` has been fully populated with `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.**
