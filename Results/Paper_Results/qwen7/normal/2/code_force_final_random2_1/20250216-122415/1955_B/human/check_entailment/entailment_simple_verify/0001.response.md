### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires verifying if a given array `l` can form a progressive square with specified parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. A progressive square is constructed by placing the minimum element `a` in the top-left corner and filling the rest of the matrix according to the formula `a + k * c + d * h`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Finding Minimum Value**: The function correctly finds the minimum value `a` in the array `l`.
   - **Generating Expected Sequence**: The function generates the expected sequence `li` using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all positions `(k, h)` in the `n x n` matrix.
   - **Sorting**: Both the generated sequence `li` and the input array `l` are sorted before comparison.
   - **Comparison**: The function compares the sorted sequences `li` and `l`. If they match, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The function correctly handles the generation of the progressive square sequence.
   - The sorting step ensures that the comparison is done correctly regardless of the initial order of elements in `l`.
   - The comparison logic is correct and returns the appropriate result ('yes' or 'no').

4. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - The state transitions and the logic flow are consistent with the problem requirements.
   - The final comparison and return statements are correctly implemented.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the minimum value correctly.
   - The sorting step ensures that the comparison is done in a consistent manner.
   - The function correctly identifies when the input array matches the expected sequence.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and should work as intended for the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
