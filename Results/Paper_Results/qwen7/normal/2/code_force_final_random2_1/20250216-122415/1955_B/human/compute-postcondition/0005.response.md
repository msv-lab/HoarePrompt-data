Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `h` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `h` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 0
   - `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive
   - `h` is 0
   - `li` is a list containing the value `a + k * c + d * h`, which simplifies to `a` since `k` is 0.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `h` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `h` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, `h` will become 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `k` remains 0.
   - `n` remains between 2 and 500 inclusive.
   - `h` becomes 1.
   - `li` is still a list containing the value `a` since `k` is 0 and `h` is now 1 (but the list content does not change based on the loop).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 1, `li` is a list containing the value `a`**
