Output State: `k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 3 (or any value from 0 to n-1), `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `k` remains 0, `n` still must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` will be the last value it was set to, which can be any value from 0 to `n-1`. The list `li` will contain `n` elements, starting from `a` and increasing by `d` for each subsequent element, so the list will be `[a, a+d, a+2d, ..., a+(n-1)d]`.
