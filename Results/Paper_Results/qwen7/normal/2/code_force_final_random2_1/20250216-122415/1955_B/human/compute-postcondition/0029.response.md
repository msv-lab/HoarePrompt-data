Output State: **`li` now contains the elements `a + k * c + d * (h_prev + 1)` and `a + k * c + d * (h_prev + 2)`, `h` is `h_prev + 2`, and `n` is greater than `h_prev + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`, where `h` is given as `h_prev + 2`. Therefore, the new element added to `li` is `a + k * c + d * (h_prev + 2)`. The other variables (`h` and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
