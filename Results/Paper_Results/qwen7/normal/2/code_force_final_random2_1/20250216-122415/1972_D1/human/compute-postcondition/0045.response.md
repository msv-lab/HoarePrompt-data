Output State: **`b` must be at least `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is `suma + x`**

Explanation: The variable `suma` is updated by adding the value of `x` to it. The value of `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. The other variables `b` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `x` is also updated but its exact numerical value depends on the values of `a` and `i`.
