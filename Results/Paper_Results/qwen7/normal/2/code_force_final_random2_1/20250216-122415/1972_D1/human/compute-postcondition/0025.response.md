Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is the `for t in range(T)` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `t` and `T`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t < T`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `T` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\)
   - `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input
   - `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer
   - `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer
   - `suma` is the sum of `x` values calculated for each iteration of the loop
   - `i` is `b + 1`
   - `x` is the last value of `x` calculated before the loop ends
   - If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true, `suma` is updated to include the final `x` value.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition is `t < T`, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `t` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `T` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t` will be 1.
   - `T` remains the same.
   - All other variables (`info`, `a`, `b`, `suma`, `i`, `x`) are not part of the loop head and thus remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 1, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4**
