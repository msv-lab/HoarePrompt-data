Output State: **After all iterations, `b` will be 0, `i` will be `b + 1`, `x` will be `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` with the condition that `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, and `suma` will be the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b`. After all iterations, `i` will become `b + 1`, making the loop condition `i < b + 1` false, thus terminating the loop. During each iteration, `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1` and added to `suma` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0. Therefore, `suma` accumulates the sum of all valid `x` values.
