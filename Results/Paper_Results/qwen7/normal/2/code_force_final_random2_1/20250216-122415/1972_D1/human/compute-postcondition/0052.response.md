Output State: **`a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\), `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations, and `t` is `T`; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `a` and `b`. Specifically, `a` is assigned the value of `int(info[0])`, and `b` remains unchanged with its initial value of 0. The values of `i`, `x`, `suma`, `t`, and `info` remain as they were in the initial state since no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.
