Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1, `suma` is `x`, `i` is 2, `x` is (a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1.**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Given that `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // 1` and `i` is 2, `x` simplifies to `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 1`, which further simplifies to `(a - 2) // 1`. Since `a` is an integer, `(a - 2) // 1` is simply `a - 2`. Therefore, `suma` is now `suma + (a - 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
