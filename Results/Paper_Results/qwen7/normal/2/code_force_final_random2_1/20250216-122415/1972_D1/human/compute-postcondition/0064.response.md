Output State: **`a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `x` is `(a - 2) // 2 + 1`, `suma` is `(a - 2) // 2 + (a - 2) // 2 + 1**.

Explanation: The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Given that `x` is defined as `(a - 2) // 2 + 1`, the updated value of `suma` becomes `(a - 2) // 2 + (a - 2) // 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
