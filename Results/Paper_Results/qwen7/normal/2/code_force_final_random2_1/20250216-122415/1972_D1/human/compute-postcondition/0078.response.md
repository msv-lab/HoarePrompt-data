Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates a cumulative sum based on specific conditions involving \(a\) and \(b\). After processing all test cases, it prints the final cumulative sum minus one. The function does not return any value but outputs the result directly.**
