You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:

            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:

    #State: Output State: All variables outside the loop, including `T`, `info`, `a`, and `b`, retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `a` is the value from the last input `info[0]`, `b` is the maximum integer such that the loop ran from 1 to `b` for that particular input, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is the value of `x` computed for the final iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true, and `suma` is the cumulative sum of all valid `x` values calculated during each iteration where the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` was satisfied.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `a` will be the last value from `info[0]`, `b` will be the highest integer that allowed the loop to run through all its iterations for that input, `i` will be `b + 1`, `x` will be the value of `x` computed for the final valid iteration, and `suma` will contain the sum of all valid `x` values from each iteration where the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` was met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates a cumulative sum based on specific conditions involving \(a\) and \(b\). After processing all test cases, it prints the final cumulative sum minus one. The function does not return any value but outputs the result directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Test Cases and Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Calculation of Valid Pairs:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i ≤ a` and `1 ≤ j ≤ b`.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of `i` and `j`.
   - However, the inner loop condition and logic seem incorrect and do not match the problem statement.

3. **Inner Loop Logic:**
   - The original code snippet inside the comment block was intended to check the condition `if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0`, but this part is commented out.
   - Instead, the program uses a different formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` to compute `suma`.
   - This formula does not correctly implement the required condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

4. **Formula Explanation:**
   - The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` seems to be an attempt to count something related to `i`, but it does not directly address the problem's requirements.
   - The division and modulus operations in the original condition are not handled correctly in the current implementation.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `suma - 1` for each test case, which is incorrect because `suma` is not computed correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
