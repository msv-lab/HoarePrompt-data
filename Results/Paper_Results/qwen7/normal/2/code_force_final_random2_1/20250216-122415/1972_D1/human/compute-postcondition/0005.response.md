Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer, the code prints pairs (i, j) where i ranges from 1 to a and j ranges from 4 to b, and if (j + i) % (j * math.gcd(i, j)) == 0, the pair (i, j) is printed, `suma` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `suma` is initialized to 0, but no operations are performed on it in the given code snippet. The conditions for printing pairs (i, j) are checked within the loops, but the value of `suma` remains unchanged. All other variables and their states remain as they were in the initial state.
