Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1, `suma` is `x`, `i` is 3, `x` is (a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 ** 2 + 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 ** 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `(a - 6) // 9 + 1`. The values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `suma`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `x`, which is now calculated as `(a - 6) // 9 + 1`.
