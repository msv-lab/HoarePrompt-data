Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1, `suma` is `x + (a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`, `i` is 3, `x` is (a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` updates the value of `suma` by adding `x` to its current value. Given that `x` is calculated as `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`, which simplifies to `(a - 6) // 3`, the updated value of `suma` is the original value of `suma` plus this expression. All other variables remain unchanged.
