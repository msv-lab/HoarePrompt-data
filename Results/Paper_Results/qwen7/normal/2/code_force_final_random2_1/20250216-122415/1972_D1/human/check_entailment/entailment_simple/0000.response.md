Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. The provided solution uses a nested loop to iterate through possible values of \(a\) and \(b\). However, the inner loop logic is incorrect. The commented-out section attempts to directly check the condition but is not used in the final implementation.
3. The actual implementation calculates `x` using the formula \(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\) and adds it to `suma` if the numerator is positive. This logic seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs, but it is not derived from the problem statement's conditions.
4. To verify correctness, let's consider the example provided:
   - For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the expected output is 14.
   - The code calculates `x` for each \(i\) from 1 to 8 and sums them up, subtracting 1 at the end.
   - Let's manually check a few values:
     - For \(i = 1\): \(x = \frac{10 - 1 \cdot 0}{1^2} + 1 = 11\)
     - For \(i = 2\): \(x = \frac{10 - 2 \cdot 1}{2^2} + 1 = 2\)
     - For \(i = 3\): \(x = \frac{10 - 3 \cdot 2}{3^2} + 1 = 0\)
     - For \(i = 4\): \(x = \frac{10 - 4 \cdot 3}{4^2} + 1 = 0\)
     - Summing these up: \(11 + 2 + 0 + 0 + ... + 0 = 13\), and subtracting 1 gives 12, which is not the expected 14.
5. The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The formula used to calculate `x` does not align with the problem's conditions.

Correctness: **False**
