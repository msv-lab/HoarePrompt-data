Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6) are processed. The function returns a result based on the conditions given for n and m, without explicitly showing how the processing occurs.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a series of test cases through its internal processing logic, where each test case consists of an integer `t` followed by pairs of integers `n` and `m`. The function evaluates `n` and `m` according to specified conditions and returns a result accordingly.
