Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first and second elements of the list `info` (converted to integers) to variables `a` and `b`, respectively. The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged. The list `info` is also mentioned to be a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, which remains valid.
