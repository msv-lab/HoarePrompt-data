Output State: All variables outside the loop, including `T`, `info`, `a`, and `b`, retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `a` is the value from the last input `info[0]`, `b` is the maximum integer such that the loop ran from 1 to `b` for that particular input, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is the value of `x` computed for the final iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true, and `suma` is the cumulative sum of all valid `x` values calculated during each iteration where the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` was satisfied.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `a` will be the last value from `info[0]`, `b` will be the highest integer that allowed the loop to run through all its iterations for that input, `i` will be `b + 1`, `x` will be the value of `x` computed for the final valid iteration, and `suma` will contain the sum of all valid `x` values from each iteration where the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` was met.
