Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `b` will be 0 after all iterations.
   - `i` will be `b + 1`, so `i` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - `x` will be calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` with the condition that `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0. Given `i = 1`, this simplifies to `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 = (a - 0) // 1 = a // 1 = a`.
   - `suma` will be the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations. Since `i` starts from 1 and there is no further iteration specified, `suma` will be `a`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(suma - 1)`.
   - Given that `suma` is `a`, the expression `suma - 1` becomes `a - 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output `a - 1`.

Output: **a - 1**
