Output State: `t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer, `suma` is the sum of `x` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is the last value of `x` calculated before the loop ends, if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true, `suma` is updated to include the final `x` value.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = b`, calculating the value of `x` for each `i` and updating the `suma` variable accordingly. After the loop completes, `i` will be `b + 1`, and `suma` will contain the cumulative sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop's execution.
