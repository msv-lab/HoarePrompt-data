Output State: **`a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\), `suma` is 0, and `t` is `T`.**

Explanation: The code simply initializes `suma` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
