Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`. It also correctly handles the coordinates `(r_i, c_i)` for each move.

2. **Counting Valid Moves**: The program counts the number of moves where `c_i == r_i` (which means the rooks are placed on the diagonal) and adds 2 for all other moves. This is done correctly, and the count `num` is used to determine the number of remaining empty positions `m` (i.e., `m = n - num`).

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations. The base cases are handled correctly (`dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`). The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is also correct and follows the logic of counting configurations for a given number of remaining positions.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The use of modulo `10 ** 9 + 7` ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits and handles large numbers correctly.

5. **Output**: The program prints the correct number of configurations for each test case, modulo `10 ** 9 + 7`.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and performs the necessary calculations correctly.

Correctness: **True**
