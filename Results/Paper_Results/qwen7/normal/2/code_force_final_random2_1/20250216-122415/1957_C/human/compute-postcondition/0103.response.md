Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an integer obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to an integer, and `num` is `c + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 1, so `num` becomes `c + 1`. The other variables (`i`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
