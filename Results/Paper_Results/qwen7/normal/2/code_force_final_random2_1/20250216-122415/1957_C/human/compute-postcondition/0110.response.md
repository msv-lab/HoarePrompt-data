Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `c` is the first integer from the input split by space, `r` is the second integer from the input split by space, and `num` is either `c + 1` if `c` equals `r`, or `num + 2` if `c` does not equal `r`.**

This means that the input was split into two integers, which were assigned to `c` and `r` respectively. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `num` is updated based on whether `c` equals `r`.
