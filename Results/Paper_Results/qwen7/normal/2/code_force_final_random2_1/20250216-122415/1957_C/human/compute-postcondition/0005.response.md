Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `k`, and the range function itself. The variable `i` is the loop counter, and it starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 0 (as per the typical behavior of the `range` function), we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < k`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `k` for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to 0.
   - The condition `i < k` must hold true for the loop to start.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is 0, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
