Output State: **`i` is `k`, `c` is the integer entered by the user first, `r` is the integer entered by the user second, `num` is the total count of operations performed based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` containing `0`s, `dp[1]` is set to `1`.**

Explanation: The code sets `dp[1]` to `1`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `c`, `r`, `num`, `m`, or the list `dp` (other than setting `dp[1]` to `1`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and only `dp[1]` is updated.
