Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `c` and `r`. The value of `k` and the expression for `i` remain unchanged from the initial state.
