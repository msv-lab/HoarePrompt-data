Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is 0, `i` is 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts using space as a delimiter, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `c` and `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
