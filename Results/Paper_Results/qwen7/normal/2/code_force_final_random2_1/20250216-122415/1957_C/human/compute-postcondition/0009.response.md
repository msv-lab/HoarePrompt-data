Output State: **`num` is 1, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given that `num` was initially 0, after executing this line, `num` becomes 1. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
