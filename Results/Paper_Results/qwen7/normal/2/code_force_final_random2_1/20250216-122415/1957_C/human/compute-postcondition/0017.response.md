Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 2, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split. If `c` equals `r`, `num` remains either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `num` is set to 3.
