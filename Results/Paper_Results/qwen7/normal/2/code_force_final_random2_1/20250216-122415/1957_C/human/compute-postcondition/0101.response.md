Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`; `c` is an input integer, `r` is an integer obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input string, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `c` and `r`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to `k - 1`.
