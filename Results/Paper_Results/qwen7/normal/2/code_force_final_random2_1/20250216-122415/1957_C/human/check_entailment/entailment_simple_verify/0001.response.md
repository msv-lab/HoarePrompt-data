### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads `k` moves, where each move consists of a row `r` and a column `c`.

2. **Move Count Calculation**:
   - The variable `num` correctly counts how many moves were mirrored (i.e., `c == r`).
   - For each non-mirrored move, it adds 2 to `num` because both a white and a black rook are placed.
   - This calculation gives the total number of unique positions occupied by rooks.

3. **Remaining Positions**:
   - The remaining positions on the board are correctly calculated as `m = n - num`.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - If `m == 0`, there are no remaining positions, so the number of configurations is 0.
   - If `m == 1`, there is exactly one position left, so the number of configurations is 1.

5. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - A dynamic programming array `dp` is used to store the number of configurations for `m` remaining positions.
   - The base cases are correctly initialized: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For `m >= 3`, the recurrence relation is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) \times dp[i-2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula correctly accounts for placing a rook in one of the `i` positions and considering the configurations for the remaining `i-1` positions.

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.

7. **Handling Remaining Positions**:
   - The logic for handling the remaining positions is sound and follows the problem constraints.

### Validation Using Annotations
- **Initial State**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n\). The coordinates \((r_i, c_i)\) for each move you made are integers such that \(1 \leq r_i, c_i \leq n\).
- **State After Reading Moves**: `num` is the count of mirrored moves, and `m` is the number of remaining positions.
- **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: `dp` is initialized correctly for the base cases.
- **Dynamic Programming Recurrence**: The recurrence relation is applied correctly for all remaining positions.

### Conclusion
Based on the detailed analysis and validation using the annotations, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The original assessment is accurate.
