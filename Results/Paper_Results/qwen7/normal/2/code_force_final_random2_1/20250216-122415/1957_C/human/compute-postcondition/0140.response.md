Output State: **The final state of dp will be a list of length `m + 1` where each element dp[i] (for i from 1 to m) is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for all i from 3 to m.**

In this final state, the variable `dp` will contain the results of the loop's computation for all values up to `m`. Each element in the `dp` list represents the result of the formula applied to the previous elements, ensuring that the calculations wrap around using modulo `10^9 + 7`. The other variables (`i`, `c`, `r`, `num`, `m`, `n`) will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, with `i` being `m + 1` since the loop runs from 3 to `m` inclusive.
