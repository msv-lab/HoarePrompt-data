Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < k`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `num` is either 2 or 3
   - `i` is 2
   - `c` is the first integer from the input split
   - `r` is the second integer from the input split
   - If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `num` is 3.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged because it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains the same (an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\))
- `n` remains the same (an input integer)
- `k` remains the same (an input integer)
- `num` remains the same (either 2 or 3)
- `i` is now 3
- `c` remains the same (the first integer from the input split)
- `r` remains the same (the second integer from the input split)

So, the updated state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 3, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split**.
