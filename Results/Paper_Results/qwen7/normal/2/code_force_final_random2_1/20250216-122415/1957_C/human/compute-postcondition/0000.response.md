Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and we have read one integer input which is assigned to `t`.**

The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, after reading the input, `t` retains this property. The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
