Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and \(2k\), `i` is `k-1`, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. The value of `m` is `n - num`, which remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states.
