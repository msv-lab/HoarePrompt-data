Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the integers split from the input.**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `c` and `r` respectively. The values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
