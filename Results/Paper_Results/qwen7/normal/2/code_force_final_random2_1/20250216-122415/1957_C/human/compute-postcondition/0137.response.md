Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(3, m + 1):`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was calculated according to the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)`. However, the exact value of `i` is not given directly in the problem statement. We know that the loop starts from `3` and goes up to `m + 1`.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it iterates, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**: The only thing that changes is the value of `i`. Therefore, we need to update `i` to `i + 1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we can represent it as `i` being incremented by 1. Thus, the final state can be written as:

State: **`dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10**9 + 7)`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
