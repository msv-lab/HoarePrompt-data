Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an integer obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to an integer, and `c` is not equal to `r`; `num` is `num + 2`.**

The value of `num` is incremented by 2, while the values of `i`, `c`, `r`, and the condition `c != r` remain unchanged from the initial state.
