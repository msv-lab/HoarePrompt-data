Output State: **`dp[6]` is `(dp[5] + 10 * dp[4] * 2) % 1000000007, i` is 6**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[6]` using the formula `(dp[5] + (6 - 1) * dp[4] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since `i` is 6, it remains unchanged. The initial state of `dp[6]` was given as \((dp[5] + (6 - 1) * dp[4] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\), which simplifies to \((dp[5] + 10 * dp[4] * 2) \% 1000000007\). Therefore, `dp[6]` is now updated to this value, and `i` remains 6.
