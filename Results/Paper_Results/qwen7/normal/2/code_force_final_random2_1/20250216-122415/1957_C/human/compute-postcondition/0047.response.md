Based on the initial state provided:

- The list `dp` has been updated such that for every `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive, `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
- `i` is equal to `m`.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, and all other elements calculated according to the given formula.

When the `print(dp[m])` statement is executed, it will print the value of `dp[m]`.

To determine the value of `dp[m]`, we need to follow the recurrence relation starting from the base cases:
- `dp[1] = 1`
- `dp[2] = 3`

For `i = 3`:
\[ dp[3] = (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (3 + 2 * 1 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (3 + 4) \% (10^9 + 7) = 7 \]

For `i = 4`:
\[ dp[4] = (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (7 + 3 * 3 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (7 + 18) \% (10^9 + 7) = 25 \]

Continuing this process up to `i = m` would yield the value of `dp[m]`. Since the exact value of `m` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `dp[m]`, but we know it will be the result of applying the given formula iteratively.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value of dp[m] calculated using the given recurrence relation and modulo \(10^9 + 7\))**
