Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the total number of times `c` equals `r` plus twice the number of times `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is either 0 or `n - num`, `t` is `t - 1`, and `c` and `r` are the last integers read from input during the loop.**

The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
