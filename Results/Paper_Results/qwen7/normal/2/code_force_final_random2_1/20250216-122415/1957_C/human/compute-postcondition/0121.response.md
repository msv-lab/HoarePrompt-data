Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `k`, `c` is the integer entered by the user first, `r` is the integer entered by the user second, and `num` is the total count of operations performed based on the conditions inside the loop.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variables `c` and `r` will retain the values they had when the last iteration of the loop was executed. The variable `num` will contain the total count of operations performed, which is incremented by 1 if `c` equals `r` or by 2 if `c` does not equal `r`, for each iteration of the loop.
