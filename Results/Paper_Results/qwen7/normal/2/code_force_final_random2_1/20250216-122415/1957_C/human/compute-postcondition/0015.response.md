Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 2, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 1. Initially, `num` is either 1 or 2. After executing `num += 1`, `num` becomes either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
