### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads `k` moves, where each move consists of a row `r` and a column `c`.

2. **Move Count Calculation**:
   - The variable `num` correctly counts how many moves were mirrored (i.e., `c == r`).
   - For each non-mirrored move, it adds 2 to `num` because both a white and a black rook are placed.
   - This calculation gives the total number of unique positions occupied by rooks.

3. **Remaining Positions**:
   - The remaining positions on the board are correctly calculated as `m = n - num`.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - If `m == 0`, there are no remaining positions, so the number of configurations is 0.
   - If `m == 1`, there is exactly one position left, so the number of configurations is 1.

5. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - A dynamic programming array `dp` is used to store the number of configurations for `m` remaining positions.
   - The base cases are correctly initialized: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For `m >= 3`, the recurrence relation is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) \times dp[i-2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula correctly accounts for placing a rook in one of the `i` positions and considering the configurations for the remaining `i-1` positions.

### Correctness Check
- **Initialization and Base Cases**: The base cases are correctly set up.
- **Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation correctly accounts for the placement of rooks and the configurations of the remaining positions.
- **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.
- **Handling Remaining Positions**: The logic for handling the remaining positions is sound and follows the problem constraints.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the problem constraints and logic. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **True**
