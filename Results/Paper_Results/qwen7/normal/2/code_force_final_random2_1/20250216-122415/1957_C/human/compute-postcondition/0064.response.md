Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input; `num` is increased by 1.**

The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. The other variables (`k`, `i`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
