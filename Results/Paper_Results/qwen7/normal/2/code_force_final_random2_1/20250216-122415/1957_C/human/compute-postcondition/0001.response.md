Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero.

2. **Current state**: The current state is given as `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and we have read one integer input which is assigned to `t`.

3. **Determine the adjustment needed**: Since `t` is already within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is guaranteed to be a non-zero integer. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `t` to ensure the loop executes the first time.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that `t` is already a non-zero integer (as per the problem statement), no additional adjustments are needed.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and we have read one integer input which is assigned to t**
