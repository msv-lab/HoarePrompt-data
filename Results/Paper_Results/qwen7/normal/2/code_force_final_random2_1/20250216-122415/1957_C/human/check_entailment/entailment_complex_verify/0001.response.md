### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads `k` moves, where each move consists of a row `r` and a column `c`.

2. **Move Count Calculation**:
   - The variable `num` counts how many moves were mirrored (i.e., `c == r`).
   - For each non-mirrored move, it adds 2 to `num` because both a white and a black rook are placed.
   - This calculation gives the total number of unique positions occupied by rooks.

3. **Remaining Positions**:
   - The remaining positions on the board are calculated as `m = n - num`.

4. **Base Cases**:
   - If `m == 0`, there are no remaining positions, so the number of configurations is 0.
   - If `m == 1`, there is exactly one position left, so the number of configurations is 1.

5. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - A dynamic programming array `dp` is used to store the number of configurations for `m` remaining positions.
   - The base cases are initialized: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For `m >= 3`, the recurrence relation is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) \times dp[i-2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for placing a rook in one of the `i` positions and considering the configurations for the remaining `i-1` positions.

### Correctness Check
- **Initialization and Base Cases**: The base cases are correctly set up.
- **Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation correctly accounts for the placement of rooks and the configurations of the remaining positions.
- **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.
- **Handling Remaining Positions**: The logic for handling the remaining positions is sound and follows the problem constraints.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for calculating `num`. The program should only count the number of unique positions occupied by rooks, not the number of moves. Specifically, the program should count the number of unique rows and columns occupied by rooks, not the number of moves.

#### Flaw in the Program
- The program incorrectly counts the number of moves (`num`) instead of the number of unique positions occupied by rooks.
- For example, if a move is mirrored, it should not be counted twice. Instead, it should be counted once for the unique position.

### Example to Illustrate the Flaw
Consider the following test case:
- `n = 4`
- `k = 1`
- Move: `(1, 2)`

The correct number of unique positions occupied by rooks is 2 (one in row 1 and one in column 2).

However, the program would count `num` as 2 because it counts each move, even though the positions are the same.

### Corrected Logic
To fix this, we need to keep track of the unique rows and columns occupied by rooks. We can use sets to store the rows and columns.

#### Corrected Program
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        rows = set()
        cols = set()
        
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                if c not in rows:
                    rows.add(c)
                    cols.add(r)
            else:
                rows.add(r)
                cols.add(c)
        
        m = n - len(rows) - len(cols) + len(rows.intersection(cols))
        
        if m == 0:
            print(0)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0 for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
```

### Conclusion
The original program incorrectly counts the number of moves instead of the number of unique positions occupied by rooks. The corrected program uses sets to track the unique rows and columns, ensuring the correct number of remaining positions is calculated.

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed counting mechanism.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
