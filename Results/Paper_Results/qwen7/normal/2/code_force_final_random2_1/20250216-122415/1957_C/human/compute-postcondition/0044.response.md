Output State: **`dp[i]' is updated to (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**

This means that the value of `dp[i]` is now calculated based on the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. The values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` are used in this calculation, and the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The states of other variables remain unchanged.
