Output State: **`i` is at least 4, `m` is at least 3 and not equal to 0 or 1, `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and \(2k\), `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, `dp[i]` is updated to \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\)**.

The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\). Since the initial values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are given, and the code does not specify a particular value for `i`, the updated value of `dp[i]` depends on the previous values of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.
