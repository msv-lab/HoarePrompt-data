Output State: **`h` is `n + (n // i)`, `n` is `n - 1 - i * (n // i)`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing one element: `1`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= i * curr` updates the value of `n` by subtracting `i * curr` from it. Given that `curr` is equal to `n // i`, the new value of `n` becomes `n - i * (n // i)`. The other variables (`h`, `k`, and `costs`) remain unchanged.
