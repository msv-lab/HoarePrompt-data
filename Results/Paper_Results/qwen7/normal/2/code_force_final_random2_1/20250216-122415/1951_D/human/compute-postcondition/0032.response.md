Postcondition: `h` is the sum of all `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `n` is reduced to a non-positive value, `k` remains a positive integer, and `costs` is left with a single element `1`. If `h` is less than `k`, the function does not change `h`. Otherwise, `h` is the sum of all `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations.
