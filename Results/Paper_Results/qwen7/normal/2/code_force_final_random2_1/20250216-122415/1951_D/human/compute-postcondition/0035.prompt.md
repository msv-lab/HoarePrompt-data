You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns k, which is equal to n
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and n is greater than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: Output State: `h` is the sum of all `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `n` is reduced to a non-positive value (since it keeps decreasing by `i * curr` in each iteration until it becomes zero or negative), `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing one element: `1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `h` will be the total of all `curr` values calculated during each iteration, `n` will be reduced to zero or a negative number (depending on the values of `i` and `curr`), `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop, `costs` will be left with a single element `1` after the first element is consumed in the loop iterations.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: 1
    #State: `h` is the sum of all `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `n` is reduced to zero or a negative value (depending on the values of `i` and `curr`), `k` remains a positive integer, `costs` is left with a single element `1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, n and k, both of which are positive integers between 1 and 10^18. It returns k if k is equal to n; otherwise, it returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns k, which is equal to n

Case_2: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
