Based on the initial state provided:

- `h` is the sum of all `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations.
- `n` is reduced to zero or a negative value (depending on the values of `i` and `curr`).
- `k` remains a positive integer.
- `costs` is left with a single element `1` after the first element is consumed in the loop iterations.

The `print(*costs)` statement will print the elements of the `costs` list. Since `costs` is left with a single element `1` after the loop iterations, the print statement will output this single element.

Output: **1**
