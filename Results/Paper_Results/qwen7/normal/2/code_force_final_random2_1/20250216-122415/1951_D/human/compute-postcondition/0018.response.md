Output State: **`h` is `0 + (n - k + 1) + curr`, `n` is `n - (n - k + 1) * curr`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing one element: `1`, `curr` is `n // i`**

Explanation: The variable `h` is incremented by `curr`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `h` now includes the value of `curr` added to its previous value, which was `0 + (n - k + 1)`. The values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, and `curr` remain as they were initially.
