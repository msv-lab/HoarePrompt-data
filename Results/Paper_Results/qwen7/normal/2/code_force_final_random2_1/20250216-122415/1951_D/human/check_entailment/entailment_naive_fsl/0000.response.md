Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the number of stalls needed exceeds 60, which is a critical requirement according to the problem description.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Stalls**: The program attempts to handle the case with only 2 stalls (`costs = [n - k + 1, 1]`), but it does not consider scenarios where more than 2 stalls might be necessary. For example, if `n = 100` and `k = 10`, the program would incorrectly output `NO` because it does not explore other possible configurations of stalls.

2. **Logic Flaws**: The logic inside the loop where the program calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall is flawed. It does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought equals `k`. Instead, it tries to fit the remaining coins into the next stall, which may not always result in buying exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases where the number of stalls needed exceeds 60. According to the problem, Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, and the program should account for this constraint.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 100`, `k = 10`
- Expected Output: `YES` followed by the configuration of stalls that allow Alice to buy exactly 10 jewels.
- Actual Output: `NO` (due to the flawed logic).

A correct implementation would involve dynamically setting up the stalls and ensuring that the total number of jewels bought equals `k` while respecting the constraint of having at most 60 stalls.
