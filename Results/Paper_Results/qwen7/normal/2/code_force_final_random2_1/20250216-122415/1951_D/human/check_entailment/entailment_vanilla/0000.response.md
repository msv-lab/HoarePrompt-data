Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires setting up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. The program needs to handle multiple test cases and output "YES" or "NO" accordingly, along with the number of stalls and their respective prices if "YES".

### Given Program Analysis

#### Input Handling
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k`.

#### Function `func_1`
- The function `func_1` is defined but not implemented properly.
- The function should check if it's possible to achieve the exact number of jewels `k` with the given coins `n`.
- If `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up one stall with price 1.
- If `n < k`, it prints "NO".
- For other cases, it attempts to split the coins into two parts and checks if the sum of the divisions can cover `k` stalls.

### Issues in the Given Program

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The function `func_1` is not fully implemented. The logic inside the function is incomplete and does not correctly handle all cases.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for determining whether it's possible to achieve exactly `k` jewels is flawed. Specifically, the current implementation only checks for two splits and does not consider more complex scenarios.
3. **Output Format**: The program does not correctly format the output for cases where it determines "YES". It should print the number of stalls and the prices for each stall.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that we can always find a way to distribute the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    # Try to set up stalls with decreasing prices
    stalls = []
    price = n
    while k > 0 and price >= 1:
        if price >= k:
            stalls.append(k)
            price -= k
            k = 0
        else:
            stalls.append(price)
            k -= 1
            price = 0
    if k > 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(' '.join(map(str, stalls)))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Input Reading**: Reads the number of test cases and processes each case.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Checks if `n` is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO".
   - Initializes an empty list `stalls` to store the prices.
   - Uses a loop to distribute the coins among the stalls:
     - If the current price (`price`) is greater than or equal to `k`, set the price to `k` and decrement `k`.
     - Otherwise, set the price to the current value of `price` and decrement `k` by 1.
   - If `k` is still greater than 0 after the loop, it means it's impossible to achieve exactly `k` jewels, so it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices for each stall.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the original program and the need for a correct approach, the provided solution is more aligned with the problem requirements. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
