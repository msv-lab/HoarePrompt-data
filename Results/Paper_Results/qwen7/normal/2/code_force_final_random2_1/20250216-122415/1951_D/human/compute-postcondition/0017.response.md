Output State: **`h` is 0 + (n - k + 1), `n` is `n - (n - k + 1) * curr`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing one element: `1`, `curr` is `n // i`**.

Explanation: The code `curr = n // i` assigns the value of `n // i` to the variable `curr`. The values of `h`, `n`, `k`, and `costs` remain unchanged from their initial states.
