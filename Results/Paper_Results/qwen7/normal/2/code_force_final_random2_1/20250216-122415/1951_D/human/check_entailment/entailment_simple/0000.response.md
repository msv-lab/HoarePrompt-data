### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (`7 3`):
     - If \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 3 \), the program correctly prints `YES`, `1`, and `1`. This means Bob sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel, and Alice buys 3 jewels.
   - For the second test case (`6 4`):
     - If \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 4 \), the program correctly prints `NO`. This means it's impossible for Bob to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels.
   - For the third test case (`255 8`):
     - If \( n = 255 \) and \( k = 8 \), the program correctly prints `YES`, `8`, and the sequence `128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1`. This means Bob sets up 8 stalls with respective prices, and Alice buys 8 jewels.

2. **Program Flow**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it checks if \( n \geq k \).
     - If \( n = k \), it prints `YES`, `1`, and `1`, indicating that Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels with one stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
     - If \( n < k \), it prints `NO`, indicating it's impossible to achieve exactly \( k \) jewels.
     - If \( n > k \), it calculates the necessary stalls and prices to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when \( n = k \) and when \( n < k \) correctly.
   - The logic for setting up stalls and calculating prices ensures that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels and prints the appropriate output for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
