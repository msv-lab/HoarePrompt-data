Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will continue to iterate until either the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` is met for some `y`, causing `b` to be updated with the value of `l[y]` and the loop to break, or until `y` reaches `n`. After all iterations, `y` will be equal to `n`, `b` will hold the maximum value found in the list `l` where `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was true, and `a`, `c`, and `l` will retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` is `y + 1`, `x` is less than `n`, and `l[x]` is either equal to `a` or `b`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `l[x]` is updated to either `a` or `b` based on which one is closer (i.e., if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, `l[x]` is set to `a`; otherwise, `l[x]` is set to `b`). If `l[x]` is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`, then `l[x]` is updated to either `a` or `b` based on which one is closer (i.e., if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, `l[x]` is set to `a`; otherwise, `l[x]` is set to `b`). If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `l[x]` is set to `a`; otherwise, `l[x]` is set to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is `y + 2`, `y` remains the same, `n` remains the same, and `l[x]` is updated to either `a` or `b` based on the conditions inside the loop. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a = l[x]`; otherwise, `b = l[x]`, and `c` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x` is `y + 3`, `y` remains the same, `n` remains the same, and `l[x]` is updated to either `a` or `b` based on the following conditions: if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `l[x]` is set to `a` if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, otherwise `l[x]` is set to `b`. If `l[x]` does not satisfy `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `l[x]` is updated to `a` if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, otherwise `l[x]` is set to `a` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise `l[x]` is set to `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
