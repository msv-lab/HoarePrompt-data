Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `y` is `n - 2`
   - `n` must be greater than `n - 1`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for x in range(y + 1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop will iterate over the range from `y + 1` to `n` (exclusive).

4. **Current Values:**
   - `y = n - 2`
   - Since `n > n - 1` is always true, `n` must be an integer greater than `n - 1`.

5. **Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop will start at `y + 1`, which is `(n - 2) + 1 = n - 1`.
   - The loop will end just before `n`.

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented from its current value to `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `x` will be `n - 1`.

7. **Adjusting States:**
   - `x` will be `n - 1`.
   - `y` remains `n - 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

8. **Final State:**
   - `y` is `n - 2`
   - `x` is `n - 1`
   - `n` must be greater than `n - 1`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`y` is `n - 2`, `x` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `n - 1***
