Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `l`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was an input integer before the execution of the code.
