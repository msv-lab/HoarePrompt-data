Output State: **`y` is 2, `b` is `l[2]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block provided, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `y` and `b`. It simply indicates that if there was a loop or conditional block, we would have exited it. Therefore, the values of `y` and `b` remain unchanged.
