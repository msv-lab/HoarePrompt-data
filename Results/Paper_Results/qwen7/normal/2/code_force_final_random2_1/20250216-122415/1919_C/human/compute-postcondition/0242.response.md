Postcondition: `y` is 3, `x` is 5, `n` must be at least 5, `a` is either the first element of the list `l` or the element at index 5 in the list `l`, `b` is either the element at index 3 in the list `l` or the element at index 5 in the list `l`, and `c` is 0. If `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `a` is the element at index 5 in the list `l` and `b` is the element at index 3 in the list `l`. Otherwise, `a` is the first element of the list `l` and `b` is the element at index 5 in the list `l`.
