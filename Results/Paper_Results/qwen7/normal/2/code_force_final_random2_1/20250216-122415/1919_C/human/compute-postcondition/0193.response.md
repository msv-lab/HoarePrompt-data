Postcondition: `y` must be at least 1, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the element at index `y` in list `l`, and `c` is 0. If the element at index `y` in list `l` is greater than the element at index `y - 1` in list `l`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
