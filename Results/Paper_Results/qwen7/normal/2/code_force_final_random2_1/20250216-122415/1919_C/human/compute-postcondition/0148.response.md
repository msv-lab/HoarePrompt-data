Output State: **`y` is `n - 2`, `x` is `n - 1`, `b` is the value of `l[x]`**

Explanation: The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value of the element at index `x` in list `l` to variable `b`. Since `x` is `n - 1`, `b` will be the value of `l[n - 1]`. The values of `y` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
