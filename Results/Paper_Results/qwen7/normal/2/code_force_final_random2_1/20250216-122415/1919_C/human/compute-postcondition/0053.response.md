Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head specifies the range for `x` as `range(y + 1, n)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `x`, `y`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute again, `x` must be within the range specified by `y + 1` to `n-1`. This means `x` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

3. **Update the State:**
   - `x` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `y` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Given the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is `y + 1`
- `x` is less than `n`
- `l[x]` is either equal to `a` or `b`

For the next iteration:
- `x` will be `y + 2` (since it is incremented by 1).
- `y` remains `y`.
- `n` remains `n`.
- The condition `x < n` must still hold true.

Since `l[x]` is updated based on the values of `a` and `b` inside the loop, we cannot determine the exact value of `l[x]` without knowing the loop body. However, we know that `l[x]` will be updated to either `a` or `b` based on the conditions given.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `x` is `y + 2`
- `y` is the same as before
- `n` is the same as before
- `l[x]` will be updated to either `a` or `b` based on the conditions inside the loop

So, the final state is:
State: **`x` is `y + 2`, `y` is the same as before, `n` is the same as before, `l[x]` will be updated to either `a` or `b` based on the conditions inside the loop**
