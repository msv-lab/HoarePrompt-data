Postcondition: `y` is 3, `x` is 6, `n` must be at least 6, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 3 in the list `l`, and `c` is 0. If the condition `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` is true, then `a` remains the first element of the list `l`. Otherwise, `a` becomes the element at index 6 in the list `l`.
