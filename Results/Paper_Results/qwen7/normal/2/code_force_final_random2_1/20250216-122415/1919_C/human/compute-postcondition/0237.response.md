Postcondition: `y` is 3, `x` is 5, `n` must be at least 5, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 3 in the list `l`, `c` is 0. If the element at index 5 in the list `l` minus the first element of the list `l` is greater than or equal to the element at index 3 in the list `l` minus the element at index 5 in the list `l`, then the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is set to the element at index 5 in the list `l`, and `b` is set to the element at index 3 in the list `l`.
