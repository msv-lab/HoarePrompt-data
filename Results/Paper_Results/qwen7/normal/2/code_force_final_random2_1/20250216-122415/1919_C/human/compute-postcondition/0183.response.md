Output State: **`y` is -1, `x` is `n - 1`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. The values of `y` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
