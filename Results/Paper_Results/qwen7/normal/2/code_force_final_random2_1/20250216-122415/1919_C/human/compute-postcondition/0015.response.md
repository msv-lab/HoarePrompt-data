Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `y` is 2, the current value of `l[2]` is equal to the previous value of `b`, and the current value of `l[1]` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the assignment `b = l[y]` was taking place. The value of `b` is updated to the previous value of `l[y]`, which is `l[2]`. The value of `y` remains 2, and the value of `l[1]` remains unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 also remains valid.
