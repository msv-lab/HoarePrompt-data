Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable in the given `for` statement is `y`. The range specified is `range(1, n)`, meaning `y` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `y` is the current value of the loop variable.
   - `x` is set to `n - 1`.
   - `a` is the first element of the list `l`.
   - `b` is the element at index `y` in list `l`.
   - `c` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `y` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `y` starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `y` would be `previous_y + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `y` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `y` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - All other variables (`x`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, they stay the same.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `y` will be `previous_y + 1`.
   - `x` remains `n - 1`.
   - `a` remains the first element of the list `l`.
   - `b` remains the element at index `y` in list `l`.
   - `c` remains 0.

Given that `y` was previously `1` (since it starts from 1), after one iteration, `y` becomes `2`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `y` should be `2`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`y` is 2, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 2 in list `l`, and `c` is 0**.
