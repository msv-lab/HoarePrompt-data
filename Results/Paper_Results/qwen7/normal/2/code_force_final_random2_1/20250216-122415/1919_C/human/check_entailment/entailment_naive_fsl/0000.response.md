Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the splitting of the array into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\) to minimize the total penalty \(p(s) + p(t)\).

The program attempts to find a pivot point in the array and then tries to maximize the number of increasing sequences in the resulting subsequences. However, this approach does not guarantee the optimal solution. For instance, consider the following input:

Input:
```
5
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

However, the program's output would be:
```
0
```

This is because the program does not explore all possible ways to split the array into two subsequences to achieve the minimum penalty. It only looks for a single pivot point and does not ensure that the resulting subsequences are optimally split to minimize the penalty.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated algorithm, possibly using dynamic programming or a different approach to explore all valid splits and choose the one with the minimum penalty.
