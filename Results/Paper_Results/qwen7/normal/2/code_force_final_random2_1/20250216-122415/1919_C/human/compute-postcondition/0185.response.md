Output State: **`y` is -1, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `b`. Since `b` was not previously defined, it is initialized to 0. The values of `y`, `x`, `a`, and the list `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
