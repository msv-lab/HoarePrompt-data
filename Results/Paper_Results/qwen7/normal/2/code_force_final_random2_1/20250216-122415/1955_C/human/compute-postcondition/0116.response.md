Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `r` is now `n-2`, `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[r]`, and `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given that initially `r` was `n - 1`, after executing the code, `r` becomes `n - 2`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
