Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a[l]` is reduced by `a[r]`, `k` is now k - 2 * a[r], `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, and the current value of `a[l]` is 0**.
