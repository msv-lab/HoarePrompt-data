Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range 1 to \(n\), `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions inside the if and else blocks, `sunks` is increased by either 1 or 2, `k` is adjusted based on the conditions inside the if and else blocks, and the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement under specific conditions or continues as usual otherwise.
