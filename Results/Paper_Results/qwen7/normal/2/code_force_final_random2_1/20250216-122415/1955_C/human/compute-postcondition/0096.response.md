Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r` - 1, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[l]`, `a[r]` is reduced by `a[l]`; if `a[r]` equals 0, `sunks` is 1, `sunks` is increased by 1, `l` is increased by 1, we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code within the loop body and move to the next iteration without executing the code after the `continue` statement. Since no specific changes occur to the variables due to the `continue` statement itself, the values of the variables remain as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
