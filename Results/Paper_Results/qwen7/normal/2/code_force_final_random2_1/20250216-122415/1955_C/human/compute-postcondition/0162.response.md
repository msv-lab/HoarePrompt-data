Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range 1 to \(n\), `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is `n-3` or `n-2`, `sunks` is increased by 1, `k` is reduced by `2 * a[r]`, `a[r]` is modified based on the conditions (reduced by `a[l]` or `2 * a[l]`), `a[l]` is reduced by `a[r]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The conditions for `r`, `sunks`, `k`, and the modifications to `a[r]` and `a[l]` are still valid. The break condition remains the same.
