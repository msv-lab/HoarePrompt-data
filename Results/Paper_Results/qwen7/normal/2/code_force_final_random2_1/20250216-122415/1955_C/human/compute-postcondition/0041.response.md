Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then `r` is set to `n - 2`, `l` is set to `r - 1`, `sunks` is set to 2, and `a[r]` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `k` equals `a[l] * 2 - 1`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. In both cases, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
