Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range 1 to \(n\), `l` is either `l + 1` or remains unchanged, `r` is `n-3` or `n-2`, `sunks` is increased by 1 or 2, `k` is reduced by `2 * a[r]`, `a[r]` is modified based on the conditions (reduced by `a[l]` or `2 * a[l]`), `a[l]` is reduced by `a[r]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after executing the if-else block. If `a[l]` is not zero, `l` remains unchanged, and the other conditions apply as described in the else part. If `a[l]` is zero, `l` is incremented by 1, and the conditions specified in the if part apply.
