Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is `sunks + 1`, and the current value of `r` is n - 1 with `a[r]` being equal to `k / 2`.**

The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1, making it `sunks + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
