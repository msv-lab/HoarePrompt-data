Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `r` is now `n-2`, `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[r]`, and `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1, we continue the loop or iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no new assignments or changes are made to the variables within the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The only difference is that the loop or iteration continues.
