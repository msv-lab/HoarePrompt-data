Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durabilities of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes `n`, `k`, and the list `a` as parameters.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) to track the first and last ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to count the number of ships that sink.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The function uses a while loop to simulate the attacks until `k` is zero or all ships are sunk.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `l` and `r` are the same. If so, it handles the special case where there is only one ship left.
   - If the durabilities of the ships at `l` and `r` are equal, it checks how many attacks can be made before either ship sinks.
     - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the durability of the ship at `l`, it simulates sinking both ships and adjusts the remaining attacks and the list `a`.
     - If `k` is exactly `a[l] * 2 - 1`, it simulates sinking the ship at `l` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.
   - If the durabilities of the ships at `l` and `r` are different, it follows a similar logic but swaps the roles of `l` and `r` based on which ship has higher durability.
   - The loop continues until `k` is zero or all ships are sunk.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's check the example provided in the problem statement with the given input:

#### Example Input:
```
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

#### Expected Output:
```
2
```

#### Execution:
1. Initial Durabilities: `[1, 2, 4, 3]`
2. First Attack (l = 0, r = 3): Sunk ship 1, Durabilities: `[2, 4, 3]`
3. Second Attack (l = 0, r = 2): Sunk ship 3, Durabilities: `[2, 4, 2]`
4. Third Attack (l = 0, r = 1): Sunk ship 1, Durabilities: `[1, 4, 2]`
5. Fourth Attack (l = 0, r = 1): Sunk ship 1, Durabilities: `[4, 2]`

After 4 attacks, 2 ships are sunk. The program correctly handles this scenario.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately simulates the attacks and counts the number of ships that sink.

**Correctness: **True**
