Output State: **`sunks` is increased by 1, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or if statement it is inside. Since the `break` statement is encountered, the loop or if statement is exited without further changes to the variables. Therefore, the values of `sunks`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
