Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range 1 to \(n\), `l` is either `l + 1` or remains unchanged, `r` is now `n-4` or `n-3`, `sunks` is increased by 1, `k` is reduced by \(2 * a[n-3]\), `a[n-3]` is modified based on the conditions (reduced by `a[l]` or `2 * a[l]`), `a[l]` is reduced by `a[n-3]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of the loop. Since no further operations are performed within the current iteration after the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
