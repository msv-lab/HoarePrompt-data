Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `r` is n - 1, `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[r]`, and `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, `sunks` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `sunks += 1` simply increments the value of `sunks` by 1. No other changes are made to the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, or `r`. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions except for `sunks`, which is now one more than its previous value.
