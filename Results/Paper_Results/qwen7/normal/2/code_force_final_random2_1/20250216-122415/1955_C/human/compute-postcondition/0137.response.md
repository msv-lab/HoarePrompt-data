Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range 1 to \(n\), `l` is equal to `r-1`, `r` is now `n-2`, `sunks` is increased by 1 to `sunks + 1`, and the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0` or `k < a[r]`, or continues as usual if `k >= a[r]`.
