Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[r]`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is set to `n - 2`. If `k` is less than twice the value of `a[r]`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `a[r]` is exactly `k / 2`, otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited.
