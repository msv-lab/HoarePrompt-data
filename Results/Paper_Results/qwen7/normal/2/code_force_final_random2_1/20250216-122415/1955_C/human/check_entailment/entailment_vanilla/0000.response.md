Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes `n`, `k`, and a list `a` as arguments.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to count the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The function uses a while loop to simulate the attacks until either `l` exceeds `r` or `k` becomes zero.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `l` equals `r`. If so, it handles the case where there is only one ship left.
   - It then checks which ship to attack next based on their current durability (`a[l]` and `a[r]`).
     - If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, it attacks the leftmost ship first.
     - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, it attacks the rightmost ship first.
   - Depending on the attack result, it updates the durability of the attacked ship and increments the `sunks` counter if the ship sinks.
   - The loop continues until no more attacks can be made or all ships are sunk.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `l` equals `r` and the remaining ship has enough durability to survive all remaining attacks.
   - It also correctly handles scenarios where the attacks reduce the durability of ships to zero, causing them to sink and be removed from further consideration.

### Verification with Provided Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `4 5 1 2 4 3`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: After 5 attacks, 2 ships are sunk.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `4 6 1 2 4 3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Explanation: After 6 attacks, 3 ships are sunk.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `5 20 2 7 1 8 2`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Explanation: All 5 ships are sunk after 20 attacks.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `2 2 3 2`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No ships are sunk after 2 attacks.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `2 15 1 5`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Both ships are sunk after 15 attacks.

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `2 7 5 2`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Both ships are sunk after 7 attacks.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the provided examples, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
