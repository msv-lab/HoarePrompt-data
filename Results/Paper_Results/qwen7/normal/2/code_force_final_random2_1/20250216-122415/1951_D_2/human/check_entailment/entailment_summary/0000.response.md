Reasoning:
1. The problem requires setting up stalls and pricing them such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
2. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to achieve this goal. Specifically:
   - It does not handle the case where `n` (the number of coins) is greater than `k` (the number of jewels) properly.
   - It incorrectly assumes that only two stalls are needed and sets their prices to `[1]` and `[n - k + 1]`.
   - The logic to distribute the remaining coins after buying the required number of jewels across additional stalls is missing.
3. The execution summary indicates that the function does not correctly calculate the number of stalls and their respective prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
