Output State: **`h` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `h` to 0. No changes are made to the values of `n`, `k`, or the `costs` list. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while updating `h` to 0.
