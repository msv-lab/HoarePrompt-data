Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in costs:`. The only variables involved here are `i` and `costs`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `h` is `0 + n // i`.
   - `n` is `n - i * curr`.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `costs` list.
   - Each iteration sets `i` to the current element in the `costs` list.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is set to the current element in `costs`, the next value of `i` will be the next element in the list.
   - The list `costs` contains two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. Therefore, the possible values for `i` are `n - k + 1` and `1`.

5. **Determine the Next State:**
   - If `i` is `1`, then the next value of `i` will be `n - k + 1`.
   - If `i` is `n - k + 1`, then the next value of `i` will be `1`.

Given that the loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `costs` list, the next value of `i` will be the next element in the list.

### Final State Adjustment:

- `h` remains unchanged because it is computed based on the previous value of `i`.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is computed based on the previous value of `i`.
- `k` remains unchanged because it is a positive integer and does not change within the loop.
- `costs` will now have one fewer element since `i` has been used once.

Since the loop will use the next element in the list, the next value of `i` will be the remaining element in the list.

### Example Answer:

State: **`h` is 0 + (n - k + 1), `n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing one element: the remaining element from the original list, which is `1` if the first element was used, or `n - k + 1` if the second element was used.**

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume the first element was used (`i = n - k + 1`):

State: **`h` is 0 + (n - k + 1), `n` is `n - (n - k + 1) * curr`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing one element: `1`.**

If the second element was used (`i = 1`):

State: **`h` is 0 + (n - k + 1), `n` is `n - 1 * curr`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing one element: `n - k + 1`.**

For simplicity, let's assume the first element was used:

State: **`h` is 0 + (n - k + 1), `n` is `n - (n - k + 1) * curr`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing one element: `1`.**

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`h` is 0 + (n - k + 1), `n` is `n - (n - k + 1) * curr`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing one element: `1`.**
