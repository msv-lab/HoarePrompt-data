Output State: **`h` is 0 + `n // i`, `n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= i * curr` updates the value of `n` by subtracting `i * curr` from it. The other variables (`h`, `k`, and `costs`) remain unchanged. Since `curr` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a variable that holds a value which is used in the subtraction. The updated value of `n` is `n - i * curr`.
