Output: **YES**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and it is explicitly stated that `n` is equal to `k`. The print statement simply outputs the string 'YES'. Since no other variables or objects are involved in this print statement, the output remains as the string 'YES'.
