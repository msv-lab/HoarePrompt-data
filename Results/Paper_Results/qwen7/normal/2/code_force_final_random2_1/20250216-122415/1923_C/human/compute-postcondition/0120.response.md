Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the values of `c` after each iteration, `c` is increased by the next element from the list `l`, `p` has an additional element which is the value of `c + x`.**

In this output state, the variable `c` has been incremented by the next element `x` from the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
