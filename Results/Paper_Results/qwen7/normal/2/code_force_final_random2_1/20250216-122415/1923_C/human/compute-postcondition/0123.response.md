Output State: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop. The variable `m` remains 1. `n` also remains unchanged. The list `l` remains the same as it was initially provided. The list `p` contains the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, starting from 0 (i.e., `c`), with each subsequent element in `p` being the sum of all elements in `l` up to that point. The variable `c` is reset to 0 after the loop completes.
