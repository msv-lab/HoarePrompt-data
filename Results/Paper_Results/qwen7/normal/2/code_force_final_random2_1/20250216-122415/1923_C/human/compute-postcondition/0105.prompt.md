Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is a list of integers, `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`, and `p` is a list containing all intermediate sums of `c` as the loop iterates through each element of `l`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer decreased by 1, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the value of `p[b - 1]` decreased by the value of `p[a - 2]`, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to 1, and the following holds: either `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to twice the difference between `b` and `a` plus 2, or `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1 or `s` is less than `2 * (b - a + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `s` is equal to the value of `p[a - 2] - p[b - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `s` is equal to the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`. If `a - 2 < 0`, the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
