Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer decreased by 1.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `s` is equal to the value of `p[b - 1]` decreased by the value of `p[a - 2]`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to 1.
- The current value of `b` is greater than `a` by at least 1.
- The current value of `s` is greater than or equal to twice the difference between `b` and `a` plus 2.

The print statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` without any variables or expressions being evaluated.

Output: **YES**
