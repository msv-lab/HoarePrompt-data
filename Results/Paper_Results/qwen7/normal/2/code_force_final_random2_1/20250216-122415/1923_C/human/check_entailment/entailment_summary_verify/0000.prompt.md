You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = []
        c = 0
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n`, the number of queries `m`, the array `c` of length `n`, and `m` queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. It calculates the cumulative sums of the array `c` and then for each query, it determines if the sum of elements in the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` is at least twice the length of the subarray. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries for each test case, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is good according to the given problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray, which is not sufficient to ensure that the subarray is good. A subarray being good requires that there exists another array \( b \) of the same length such that the sums are equal, all elements are different, and all elements in \( b \) are positive.

To illustrate, consider the following subarray: `[1, 2, 1]`. The sum of this subarray is `4`, and its length is `3`. According to the current logic, since \( 4 \geq 2 \times 3 \), the program would incorrectly output 'YES'. However, this subarray cannot be made good because no other array \( b \) can satisfy the conditions (specifically, having distinct values and all positive).

A correct approach would involve checking if the subarray can be permuted to meet the conditions, but the provided solution does not implement this logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
