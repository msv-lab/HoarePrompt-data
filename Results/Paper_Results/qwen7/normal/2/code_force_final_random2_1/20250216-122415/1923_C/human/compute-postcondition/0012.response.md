Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in l`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `l`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body Impact**: The loop body updates `c` by adding the next element in `l` to the current value of `x`. After each iteration, `c` is updated, and `p` is a list containing the updated value of `c`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `c` is increased by the next element in `l` plus the current value of `x`.
   - `p` is a list containing the updated value of `c`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `x` is being iterated over from the list `l`, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in `l`.
   - `c` will be updated based on the next element in `l` and the new value of `x`.

Given that the loop has just completed an iteration, let's denote the next element in `l` as `next_x` (which would be `l[i+1]` if `x` was `l[i]`).

5. **Update the State**:
   - `x` will be `next_x`.
   - `c` will be updated based on `next_x` and the current value of `c` from the previous iteration.

Since the exact values of `c` and `p` from the previous iteration are not given, we can only update `x` and note that `c` will be updated accordingly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is the next element in `l`, `p` is a list containing the updated value of `c`**.
