Postcondition: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in `l` minus the element at index `a-2` in list `p` if `a - 2 >= 0`. Otherwise, `s` remains the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in `l`. Additionally, the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))` is true.
