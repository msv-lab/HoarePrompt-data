Output State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element (one less than before), `c` is increased by the next element in `l`, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` appended.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(c)` appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. The initial state indicates that `l` is a list of integers with at least one element, and one element is removed from `l` before the operation. `c` is increased by the next element in `l` (which now has one less element). The list `p` is updated to include the new value of `c`.
