Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n`, the number of queries `m`, the array `c` of length `n`, and `m` queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. It calculates the cumulative sums of the array `c` and then for each query, it determines if the sum of elements in the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` is at least twice the length of the subarray. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries for each test case, the function concludes.**
