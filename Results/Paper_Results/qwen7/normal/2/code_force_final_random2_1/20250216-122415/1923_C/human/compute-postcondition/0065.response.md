Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element (one less than before).
   - `c` is increased by the next element in `l`.
   - `p` is a list containing the value of `c` appended.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for x in l:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`.
   - After each iteration, `c` is increased by the current element `x`.
   - `p` is updated to contain the current value of `c`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `l`, the variable `x` will be the next element in `l`.
   - `c` will be increased by `x`.
   - `p` will be updated to include the new value of `c`.

5. **New State:**
   - `l` must have at least one element (one less than before) because the loop is iterating over it.
   - `c` will be increased by the next element in `l`.
   - `p` will be updated to include the new value of `c`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `l` must have at least one element (one less than before).
- `c` will be increased by the next element in `l`.
- `p` will be updated to include the new value of `c`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element (one less than before), `c` is increased by the next element in `l`, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` appended.**
