Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `s` is the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1` decreased by the value of the list `p` at index `a - 2`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to 2.
- The current value of `b` is such that `b - a + 1` is greater than 1.
- The current value of `s` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `b - a + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string 'YES'. Since no other variables or objects need to be evaluated or described further for this specific print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
