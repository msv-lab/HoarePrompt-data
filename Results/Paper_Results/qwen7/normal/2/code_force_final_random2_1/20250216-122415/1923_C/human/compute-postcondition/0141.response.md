Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in `l` minus the element at index `a-2` in list `p` if `a - 2 >= 0`. Otherwise, `s` remains the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in `l`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. This changes the values of `a` and `b` to the input integers, while the other variables (`m`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
