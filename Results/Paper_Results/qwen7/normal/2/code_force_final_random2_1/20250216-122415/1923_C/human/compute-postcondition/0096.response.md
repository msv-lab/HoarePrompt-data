Output State: **`m` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `s` is equal to the value of `p[a - 2] - p[b - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. However, the initial values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `s` are not altered by this operation. The variable `s` remains equal to the value of `p[a - 2] - p[b - 1]` as per the initial state.
