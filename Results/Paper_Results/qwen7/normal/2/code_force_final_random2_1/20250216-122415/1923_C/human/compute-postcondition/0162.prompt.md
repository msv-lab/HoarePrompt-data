You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case contains n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` will be the total number of queries (q), `a` will be the last input integer for the query `a`, `b` will be the last input integer for the query `b`, and `n` will be the number of elements in the array `l`. The list `p` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `l` for each iteration of the loop. The variable `c` will be 0 as it is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration of the outer loop. For each query, `s` will be calculated as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`, otherwise `s` will be `p[b - 1]`. If `s` is greater than or equal to `2 * (b - a + 1)`, the output will be 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. This process will repeat for all `q` queries.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters t, n, q, an array c of length n, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i. It processes each query to determine the sum of elements in the subarray from index l_i to r_i within the array c and returns the results of these queries.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
