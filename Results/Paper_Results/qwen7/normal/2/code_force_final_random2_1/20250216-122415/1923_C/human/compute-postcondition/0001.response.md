Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated input**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in this operation.
