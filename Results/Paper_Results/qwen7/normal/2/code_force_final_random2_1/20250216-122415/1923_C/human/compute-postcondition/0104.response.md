Postcondition: **`m` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `s` is equal to the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`. If `a - 2 < 0`, the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.**

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts, indicating that regardless of the condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` being true or false, the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `s` do not change from their initial states as long as `a - 2 < 0`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
