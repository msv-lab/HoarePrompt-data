Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `m` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`.
- `c` is 0.
- `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`. If `a - 2 < 0`, the value of `s` remains unchanged.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string 'YES'. Since no values of `a`, `b`, or `l` are specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`, but the print statement itself does not depend on these values.

Output: **YES**
