Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer decreased by 1, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the value of `p[b - 1]` decreased by the value of `p[a - 2]`, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to 1, the current value of `b` is greater than `a` by at least 1, and the current value of `s` is greater than or equal to twice the difference between `b` and `a` plus 2.
