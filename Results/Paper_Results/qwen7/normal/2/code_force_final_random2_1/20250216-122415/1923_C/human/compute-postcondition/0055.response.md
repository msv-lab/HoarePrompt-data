Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `a` is the initial value of `a` minus twice the number of iterations plus 2, `b` is the initial value of `b`, `s` is the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `l`. The variables `m`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
