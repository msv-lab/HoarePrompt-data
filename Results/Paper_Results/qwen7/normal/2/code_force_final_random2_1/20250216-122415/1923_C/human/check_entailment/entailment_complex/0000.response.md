Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \), the number of queries \( m \), the array \( c \) of length \( n \), and \( m \) queries defined by pairs of integers \( l_i \) and \( r_i \).
3. It calculates the cumulative sums of the array \( c \) and stores them in the list `p`.
4. For each query, it determines if the sum of elements in the subarray from index \( l_i \) to \( r_i \) is at least twice the length of the subarray. This is done by checking if \( s \geq 2 \times (b - a + 1) \), where \( s \) is the sum of the subarray from \( l_i \) to \( r_i \).
5. The logic to calculate \( s \) is correct: if \( a - 2 \geq 0 \), then \( s = p[b - 1] - p[a - 2] \); otherwise, \( s = p[b - 1] \).

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the conditions provided.

Correctness: **True**
