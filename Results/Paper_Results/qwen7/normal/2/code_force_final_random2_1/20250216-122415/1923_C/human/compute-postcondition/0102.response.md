Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is explicitly given as 1.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `s` is defined as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`. Otherwise, the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string 'NO'. Since there is no calculation or condition that would change this string, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **NO**
