Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m)`. The only variables involved here are `m` and the underscore `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable since its value is not used).

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as follows:
   - `l` is a list of integers.
   - `c` is the sum of all integers in `l`.
   - `p` is a list containing all intermediate sums of `c` as the loop iterates through each element of `l`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, the variable `m` must be at least 1 because `range(m)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `m-1`. If `m` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

4. **Consider the Loop Body Impact**: Since the loop body is omitted, we don't know what changes it makes to the variables. However, the loop will iterate `m` times, updating the list `p` with intermediate sums. This means `m` should be a positive integer to ensure the loop runs for the intended number of iterations.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
