Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `a` is the initial value of `a` minus twice the number of iterations plus 2, `b` is the initial value of `b`, `s` is the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `p` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `p = []` initializes an empty list `p`. None of the other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `n`, `l`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged except for the addition of the new empty list `p`.
