Postcondition: `s1` is the string `s` concatenated with `i`; `s2` is either the string 'i' or remains unchanged; `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `len(alphabet)` is not equal to 1, `alphabet` does not contain the character `i`. Otherwise, `s2` becomes the string `'i'` concatenated with `i`.
