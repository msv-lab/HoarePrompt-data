You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, and m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:

    #State: `s1` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself, `s2` is the string formed by concatenating every unique character from `s` that was in the set `alphabet` (each character repeated once), and `alphabet` is an empty set.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` and going to the end, and the string `s2` which contains each unique character from `s` that was in the set `alphabet`.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n`. It constructs two new strings, `s1` and `s2`. `s1` is formed by concatenating the original string `s` with itself, while `s2` contains each unique character from `s` that was in the set `alphabet` (each character repeated once). The function then checks if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`. Finally, it returns a boolean indicating this check, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` and going to the end, and the string `s2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly handle the generation and checking of all possible subsequences of length `n`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

For the third test case:
- `n = 3`, `k = 3`, `m = 10`, and `s = 'aabbccabab'`.
- All possible strings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c') are: 'aaa', 'aab', 'aac', 'aba', 'abb', 'abc', 'aca', 'acb', 'baa', 'bab', 'bac', 'bba', 'bbb', 'bbc', 'bca', 'bcb', 'caa', 'cab', 'cba', 'ccc'.
- The string 'ccc' is not a subsequence of 'aabbccabab'.

However, the program does not generate these strings and check their subsequences correctly. Instead, it uses a flawed approach to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

The program should generate all possible strings of length `n` and check if they are subsequences of `s`, but it does not do this. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
