Output State: **`s1` is an empty string, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, and `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000.**

Explanation: The code initializes `s1` as an empty string. No changes are made to the values of `s`, `n`, `k`, or `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
