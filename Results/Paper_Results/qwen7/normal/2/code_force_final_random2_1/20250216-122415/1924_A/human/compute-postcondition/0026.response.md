Output State: **`s1` is the string `s` up to the current character plus the current `i`, `s2` is the string 'i' concatenated with itself, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**

Explanation: The code `s2 += i` concatenates the string `i` with itself, updating the value of `s2`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
