#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26, and m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: `s1` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself, `s2` is the string formed by concatenating every unique character from `s` that was in the set `alphabet` (each character repeated once), and `alphabet` is an empty set.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` and going to the end, and the string `s2` which contains each unique character from `s` that was in the set `alphabet`.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n`. It constructs two new strings, `s1` and `s2`. `s1` is formed by concatenating the original string `s` with itself, while `s2` contains each unique character from `s` that was in the set `alphabet` (each character repeated once). The function then checks if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`. Finally, it returns a boolean indicating this check, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` and going to the end, and the string `s2`.
