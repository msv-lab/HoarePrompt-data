### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `s` (a string), `k` (an integer representing the number of distinct characters in the alphabet), and `n` (an integer representing the desired length of subsequences).
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and appends characters to `s1` and `s2` based on whether they are in the `alphabet`.
   - After processing `s`, it checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`. If so, it returns `True`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` (where `r = len(s1) // k`), and the string `s2`.
   - If the length of `s1` is less than `n * k`, it returns `False`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k`, and the string `s2`.

2. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It calls `func_1` and processes the results.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it constructs a string `be9i` consisting of the first unused character in `alphabet` repeated `n - len(s2)` times and appends `s2` and `be9i` to `OUT`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it appends `'Yes'` to `OUT`.
   - Finally, it prints the results stored in `OUT`.

3. **Edge Cases and Validations:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where `s1` is shorter than `n * k` by constructing a string `be9i` using the first unused character in `alphabet`.
   - The logic for determining if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s` is sound, as it ensures that each unique character in `s` is considered and the length of `s1` is checked against `n * k`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. It also handles the case where not all such strings are present by providing a counterexample.

### Correctness:
**True**
