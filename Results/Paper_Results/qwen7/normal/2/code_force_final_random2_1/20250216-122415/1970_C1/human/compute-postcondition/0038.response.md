Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1 (since it was 0 before). Therefore, `i` needs to be updated to 1.

5. **Check the value of `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body. It still needs to satisfy the condition \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` must still be an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)**
