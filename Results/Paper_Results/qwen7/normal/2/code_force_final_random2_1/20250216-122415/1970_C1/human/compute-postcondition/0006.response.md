Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` is appended to the deque `tree`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and the deque `tree` contains the element `u`.**

This means that the deque `tree` now contains the element `u` that was appended, while all other variables retain their initial conditions or remain unchanged.
