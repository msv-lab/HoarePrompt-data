Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` and `v` are the values from the input split into integers, and `tree` is either a deque or a list with the elements `u` and `v` appended to it, where `u` is appended to the left of `v` if `v` is the last element of `tree`, otherwise `tree` ends up with `v` followed by `u`.**
