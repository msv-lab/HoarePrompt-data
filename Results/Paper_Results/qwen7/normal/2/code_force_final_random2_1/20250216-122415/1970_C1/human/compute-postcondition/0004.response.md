Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree is represented by an empty deque `tree`; `u` and `v` are assigned the values from input split and converted to integers.**

This means that the values of `u` and `v` are now set to the integers obtained from the input split operation, while all other variables remain unchanged. The tree remains an empty deque.
