Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
   - `u` is an input integer
   - `v` is an input integer
   - `tree` is either a list or a deque with one or two elements.
     - If `empty` is `False`, then `tree` is a list containing the elements `u` and `v`.
     - If `empty` is `True`, then `tree` is a list or deque with one element, and if `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, `u` is appended to the left of `tree`; otherwise, `tree` becomes a list or deque with one element `v`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the condition `i < n - 1` will be true as long as `n > 2`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body, so it stays the same.
   - The values of `u` and `v` remain unchanged.
   - The state of `tree` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is still an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
   - `u` is still an input integer
   - `v` is still an input integer
   - `tree` is still either a list or a deque with one or two elements, following the conditions mentioned above.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `tree` is either a list or a deque with one or two elements. If `empty` is `False`, then `tree` is a list containing the elements `u` and `v`. If `empty` is `True`, then `tree` is a list or deque with one element, and if `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, `u` is appended to the left of `tree`; otherwise, `tree` becomes a list or deque with one element `v`.**
