Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `tree` is a list with one element `v`.**

The code appends the value of `v` to the list `tree`, making `tree` a list containing `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
