Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` and `v` are the values from the input split into integers, and `tree` is either a list or a deque with the elements `v` and possibly `u` appended to it. If `v` is the last element of `tree`, `u` is appended to the left of `tree`; otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged or becomes a list or deque with `v` as its single element.
