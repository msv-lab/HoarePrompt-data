Output State: **`empty` is `False`, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `tree` is a list containing the elements `u` and `v`.**

Explanation: The variable `empty` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `u`, `v`, and `tree`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
