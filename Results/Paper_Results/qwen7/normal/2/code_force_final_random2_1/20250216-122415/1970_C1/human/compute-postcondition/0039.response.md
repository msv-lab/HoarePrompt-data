Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them based on whitespace, converting each to an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `u` and `v`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
