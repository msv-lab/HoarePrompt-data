Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the deque `tree` now contains `u` and `v` according to the following rules: if `v` was the first element of `tree`, then `u` is added to the left end of `tree`; otherwise, `v` is appended to `tree`.
