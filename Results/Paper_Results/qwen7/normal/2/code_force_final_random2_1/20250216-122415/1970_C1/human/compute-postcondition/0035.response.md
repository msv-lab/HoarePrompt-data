Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the deque `tree` now contains `v` as its first element or `v` appended to the deque depending on whether `u` equals `tree[0]`. Additionally, `u` is either added to the left end of `tree` if `u` equals `tree[0]` or `u` is not equal to `tree[0]` and is appended to the right end of `tree`.
