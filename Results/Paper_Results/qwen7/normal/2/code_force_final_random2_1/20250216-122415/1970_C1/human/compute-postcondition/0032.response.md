Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the deque `tree` now contains `v` either as its last element (if `v` was equal to `tree[-1]`) or as its first element (if `u` equals `tree[0]`). Additionally, `u` is not equal to `tree[0]`, and the deque `tree` is not empty.
