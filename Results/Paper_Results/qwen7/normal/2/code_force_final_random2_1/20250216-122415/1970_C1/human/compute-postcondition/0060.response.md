Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer (appended to the right of `tree`), `v` is an input integer, and `tree` is a list or deque with one more element than before, which is the rightmost element of `tree` plus `v`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the right of the list or deque `tree`. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and the original elements of `tree` remain unchanged. The new rightmost element of `tree` is now `tree[-1] = tree[-2] + v`.
