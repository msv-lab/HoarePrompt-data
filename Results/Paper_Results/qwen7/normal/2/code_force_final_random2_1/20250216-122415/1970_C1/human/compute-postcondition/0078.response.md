Postcondition: **`tree` contains all the edges of the tree in the order they were added, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the minimum of `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`. At least one of the moves in the `moves` list is an odd number.**
