Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer (appended to the right of `tree`), `v` is an input integer, and `tree` is a list or deque with one more element than before, which is the rightmost element of `tree` plus `u`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the right of the `tree`. Since `u` is an input integer, it gets appended to `tree`. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `tree` is either a list or a deque with one or two elements, and if `empty` is `False`, then `tree` is a list containing the elements `u` and `v`, or if `empty` is `True`, then `tree` is a list or deque with one element, and if `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, `u` is appended to the left of `tree`; otherwise, `tree` becomes a list or deque with one element `v`, still holds true after appending `u`.
