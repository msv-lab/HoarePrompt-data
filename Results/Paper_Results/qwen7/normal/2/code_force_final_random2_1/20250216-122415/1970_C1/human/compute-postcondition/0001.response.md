Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree is represented by an empty deque `tree`.**

The code initializes an empty deque named `tree`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `u`, or `v`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
