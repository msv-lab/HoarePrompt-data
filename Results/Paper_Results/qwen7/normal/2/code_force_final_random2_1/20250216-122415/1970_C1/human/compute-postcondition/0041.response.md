Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `tree` is a list containing the elements `u` and `v`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `tree`. Initially, `tree` contains only the element `u`. After appending `v`, `tree` now contains both `u` and `v`. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
