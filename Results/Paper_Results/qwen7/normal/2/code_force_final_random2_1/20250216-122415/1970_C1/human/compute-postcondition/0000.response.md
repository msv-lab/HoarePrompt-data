Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `n` and `t`. The initial values of `u` and `v` remain unchanged, and the condition about the tree having exactly two leaves also remains valid. The value of `t` is specifically set to the first integer input, while `n` is set to the second integer input.
