Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| ≤ `n` and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the other variables, so they retain their initial states.
