Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`; `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| ≤ `n` and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The original values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged. The new variable `data` is created and assigned the split result.
