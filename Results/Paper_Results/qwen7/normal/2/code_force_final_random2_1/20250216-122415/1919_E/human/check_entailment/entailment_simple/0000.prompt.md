Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

All other variables remain unchanged.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after running the loop for all iterations, each position in the `dp` list (from index 1 to \(2 * n\)) will hold the total sum of all positive values from the original `dp` list, spread out according to the rules defined in the loop, with all calculations done modulo `MOD`. The initial value at `dp[offset]` (which was 1) has been propagated and summed up across all valid indices in the list through the iterations.

    #The program returns dp[final_sum], where final_sum is equal to p[-1] + offset, and dp[j] for every index j from 1 to 2*n is the cumulative sum of all positive values in the original dp list, distributed across its indices from 1 to 2*n through multiple iterations of the loop, modulo MOD.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a; p is a list of n integers where |pi| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.

    #State: Output State: The `index` will be `3 + 2t + n`, where `t` is the final value after the loop completes all its iterations, and `n` is the integer value obtained from `data[3]`. The variable `t` will be equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is an integer greater than or equal to 3 since we know it has already executed at least 3 times. The `t` value will be the sum of all `t` values from each iteration, meaning if the loop iterates `k` times, `t` will be `k`. The `n` value remains the same as it is derived from `data[3]` and does not change within the loop. The `p` list will be updated to the last list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers after the loop completes. The `data` list remains unchanged as no modifications are made to it within the loop. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, with the latest result being the most recent addition to the list.

    #In summary, the `index` will be `3 + 2t + n`, `t` will be the total number of iterations, `n` will be the integer from `data[3]`, `p` will be the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` will remain unchanged, and `results` will be a list of results from each iteration of the loop.
    for res in results:

    #State: The `index` will be `3 + 2t + n`, where `t` is the total number of iterations (length of `results`), `n` is the integer from `data[3]`, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` remains unchanged, and `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.
