To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`index`**: Defined as `3 + 2t + n`, where `t` is the total number of iterations (length of `results`), and `n` is the integer from `data[3]`.

2. **`t`**: The length of `results`, which means `t` is the number of iterations that have occurred.

3. **`n`**: An integer from `data[3]`.

4. **`p`**: A list of integers from the last iteration.

5. **`data`**: Remains unchanged, so it is the same as the initial state of `data`.

6. **`results`**: Contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.

Given this information, the `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, but since `res` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we need to infer what it might refer to. Typically, in such contexts, `res` could be the result of the last iteration of `func_1(n, p)` or the last value in `results`.

Since `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and assuming `res` refers to the last value in `results`, the print statement will output the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.

Output: **the return value of func_1(n, p) from the last iteration (where n is the integer from data[3] and p is the list of integers from the last iteration)**
