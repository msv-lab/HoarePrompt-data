Output State: **`index` is 5 + n, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` plus the new result.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` converts the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into a list of integers. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `index` remains as `5 + n`, `t` must still be greater than 1, `n` is still the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` now holds the list of integers obtained from the specified slice of `data`, and `data` and `results` retain their original states except that `results` now includes the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
