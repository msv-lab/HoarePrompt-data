Postcondition: `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, where for every index `j` from 1 to \(2 * n\) (inclusive), `new_dp[j]` is the sum of all `dp[k]` where `dp[k] > 0`, modulo `MOD`. `i` is `m + 1`, and `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 * n + 1\) where each element is 0. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to \(2 * n\), then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
