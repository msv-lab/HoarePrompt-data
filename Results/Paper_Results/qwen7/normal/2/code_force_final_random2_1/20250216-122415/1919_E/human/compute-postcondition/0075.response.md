Output State: **`new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 filled with zeros, and `i` is `m + 2`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `new_dp` as a list of zeros with a length of `2 * n + 1`. This means that `new_dp` is now a list where every element is 0, and the list has `2 * n + 1` elements. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still `m + 2`.
