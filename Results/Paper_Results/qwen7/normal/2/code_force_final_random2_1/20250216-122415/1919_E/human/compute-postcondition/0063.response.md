Output State: **`new_dp[j + 1]` is the sum of its previous value and `dp[j]`, modulo `MOD`; `i` is `m + 1`; `j` is `0`.**

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to its current value and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The initial values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, `new_dp[j + 1]` now includes the contribution of `dp[j]` in its sum, while `i` and `j` retain their original values.
