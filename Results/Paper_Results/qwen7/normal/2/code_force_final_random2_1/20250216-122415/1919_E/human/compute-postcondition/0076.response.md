Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the range `range(2 * n + 1)`. This means the loop will iterate over the values of `j` from 0 to `2 * n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j` being 0 (as per the range definition), we need to ensure that `j` is initialized to 0.

3. **Determine the state of `n`**: The value of `n` is used in the range definition, but since `n` itself is not directly modified within the loop, its initial value is not strictly required to be adjusted. However, it is important to know that `n` is a valid integer that allows the range to be defined correctly.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `2 * n + 1`. Given that `j` starts at 0, the loop will always execute at least once unless `n` is 0. But since `n` is not specified, we assume it is a valid non-negative integer.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `j` is set to 0 at the start of the loop, and `n` is a valid non-negative integer.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should be 0.
- `n` should be a valid non-negative integer.

So, the final state is:

**`new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 filled with zeros, `i` is m + 2, `j` is 0, and `n` is a valid non-negative integer.**

However, since `i` is not part of the loop head and the question specifies only adjusting states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `j` and `n`.

**State: **`new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 filled with zeros, `j` is 0, and `n` is a valid non-negative integer**.
