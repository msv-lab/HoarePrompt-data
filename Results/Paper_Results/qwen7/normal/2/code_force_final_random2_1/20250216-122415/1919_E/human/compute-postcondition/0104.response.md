Output State: **`new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) filled with zeros, except for the element at index `j - 1`, which is updated to \((new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\).**

Explanation: The code updates the element at index `j - 1` in the list `new_dp` by adding `dp[j]` to it and taking the result modulo `MOD`. All other elements in `new_dp` remain unchanged and are still filled with zeros.
