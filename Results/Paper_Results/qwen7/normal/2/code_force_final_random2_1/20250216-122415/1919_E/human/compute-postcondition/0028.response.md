Output State: The `index` will be `3 + 2t + n`, where `t` is the final value after the loop completes all its iterations, and `n` is the integer value obtained from `data[3]`. The variable `t` will be equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is an integer greater than or equal to 3 since we know it has already executed at least 3 times. The `t` value will be the sum of all `t` values from each iteration, meaning if the loop iterates `k` times, `t` will be `k`. The `n` value remains the same as it is derived from `data[3]` and does not change within the loop. The `p` list will be updated to the last list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers after the loop completes. The `data` list remains unchanged as no modifications are made to it within the loop. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, with the latest result being the most recent addition to the list.

In summary, the `index` will be `3 + 2t + n`, `t` will be the total number of iterations, `n` will be the integer from `data[3]`, `p` will be the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` will remain unchanged, and `results` will be a list of results from each iteration of the loop.
