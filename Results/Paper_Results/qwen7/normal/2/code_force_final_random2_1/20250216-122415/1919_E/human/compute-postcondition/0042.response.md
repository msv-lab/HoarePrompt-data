Postcondition: `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, where for every index `j` from 1 to \(2 * n\) (inclusive), `new_dp[j]` is the sum of all `dp[k]` where `dp[k] > 0`, modulo `MOD`, `i` is `m + 1`, `new_dp` is a list of length \(2 * n + 1\) where each element is 0, and `m + 1` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Additionally, if `dp[j] > 0`, then the value of `new_dp[j]` is updated to reflect the sum of all `dp[k]` where `dp[k] > 0` for all `k` from 1 to \(2 * n\), modulo `MOD`.
