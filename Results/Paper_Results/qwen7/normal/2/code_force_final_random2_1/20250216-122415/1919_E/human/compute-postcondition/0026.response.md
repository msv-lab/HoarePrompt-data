Output State: **`index` is 8 + 2n, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result, `p` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` has appended the `result` value.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `results` now contains both the original return value of `func_1(n, p)` and the newly appended `result` value.
