Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `t` reaches 0. After all iterations, `index` will be `2 + t * (1 + n)`, where `t` is the final value after the loop ends and `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`. The variable `t` will be 0, `n` will be the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` will be the last list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `data` will be a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` will be a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `index` will be set to `2 + t * (1 + n)`, `t` will be 0, `n` will be the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` will be the last list of integers obtained from the data, `data` will remain unchanged, and `results` will contain the outputs of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.
