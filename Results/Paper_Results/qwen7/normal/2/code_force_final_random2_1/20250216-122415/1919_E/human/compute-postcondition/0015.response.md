Output State: **`index` is 5 + n, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where \( |p_i| \leq n \) and sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` plus the new result.**

Explanation: The variable `index` was initially set to `4 + n`. After executing `index += 1`, the value of `index` is updated to `5 + n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
