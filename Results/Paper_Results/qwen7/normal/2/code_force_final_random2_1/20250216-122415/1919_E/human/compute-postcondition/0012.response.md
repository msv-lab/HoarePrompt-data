Output State: **`index` is 4 + n, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| â‰¤ `n` and sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` plus the new result, `p` is now a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` (which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`) to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged. The updated state includes the new element in the `results` list.
