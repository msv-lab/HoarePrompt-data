### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the number of initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that their sorted prefix sums match the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` is designed to simulate the process of generating the prefix sums and then sorting them.
   - It uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to generate the prefix sums.
   - The function initializes a `dp` array to keep track of the number of ways to achieve each prefix sum.
   - It iteratively updates the `dp` array based on the transitions allowed by adding `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
   - Finally, it returns the count of ways to achieve the final prefix sum `p[-1] + n` (where `n` is the size of the array).

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n` and the list `p`.
   - It calls `func_1` to compute the result for each test case.
   - It collects the results and prints them.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the process of generating prefix sums and counting the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sums.
   - The implementation in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the detailed analysis, both functions together correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
