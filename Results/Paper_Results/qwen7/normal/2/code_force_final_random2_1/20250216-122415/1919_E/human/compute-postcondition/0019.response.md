Output State: **`index` is 5 + 2n, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result.**

Explanation: The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `index`, `t`, `n`, `p`, `result`, `data`, and the structure of `results` are as described in the initial state, with `results` now including the new appended value.
