Postcondition: `new_dp[j]` is the sum of all `dp[k]` where `dp[k] > 0`, modulo `MOD`. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is the sum of its previous value and `dp[j]`, modulo `MOD`; `i` is `m + 1`; `j` is `0`. If `j + 1` is greater than `2 * n`, no changes are made to `new_dp[j]`.
