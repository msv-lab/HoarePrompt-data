You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and p is a list of n integers where |p[i]| ≤ n for all 0 ≤ i < n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a.
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        
        dp = new_dp
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `dp` after the loop executes all iterations is such that for every index `j` from 1 to \(2 * n\), `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all positive values in the original `dp` list, distributed across its indices from 1 to \(2 * n\) through multiple iterations of the loop, modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after running the loop for all iterations, each position in the `dp` list (from index 1 to \(2 * n\)) will hold the total sum of all positive values from the original `dp` list, spread out according to the rules defined in the loop, with all calculations done modulo `MOD`. The initial value at `dp[offset]` (which was 1) has been propagated and summed up across all valid indices in the list through the iterations.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns dp[final_sum], where final_sum is equal to p[-1] + offset, and dp[j] for every index j from 1 to 2*n is the cumulative sum of all positive values in the original dp list, distributed across its indices from 1 to 2*n through multiple iterations of the loop, modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer within the range 1 to 5000, and `p`, a list of `n` integers where each element's absolute value is less than or equal to `n`. The function returns `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the last element of `p` plus an offset, and `dp[j]` for every index `j` from 1 to 2*n is the cumulative sum of all positive values in the original `dp` list, distributed across its indices from 1 to 2*n through multiple iterations of the loop, modulo `MOD`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns dp[final_sum], where final_sum is equal to p[-1] + offset, and dp[j] for every index j from 1 to 2*n is the cumulative sum of all positive values in the original dp list, distributed across its indices from 1 to 2*n through multiple iterations of the loop, modulo MOD.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
