Output State: **`new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) filled with zeros, `dp` is defined, `j` is \(k + 1\), and `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and taking the modulus with `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `new_dp` is still a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) filled with zeros, `dp` is defined, and `j` is \(k + 1\). The condition \(j - 1 \geq 0\) must still hold for the next iteration.
