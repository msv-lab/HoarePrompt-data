#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and p is a list of n integers where |p[i]| ≤ n for all 0 ≤ i < n, representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a.
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)

    dp[offset] = 1

            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:

    #State: Output State: The final state of `dp` after the loop executes all iterations is such that for every index `j` from 1 to \(2 * n\), `dp[j]` is the cumulative sum of all positive values in the original `dp` list, distributed across its indices from 1 to \(2 * n\) through multiple iterations of the loop, modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after running the loop for all iterations, each position in the `dp` list (from index 1 to \(2 * n\)) will hold the total sum of all positive values from the original `dp` list, spread out according to the rules defined in the loop, with all calculations done modulo `MOD`. The initial value at `dp[offset]` (which was 1) has been propagated and summed up across all valid indices in the list through the iterations.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns dp[final_sum], where final_sum is equal to p[-1] + offset, and dp[j] for every index j from 1 to 2*n is the cumulative sum of all positive values in the original dp list, distributed across its indices from 1 to 2*n through multiple iterations of the loop, modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n`, an integer between 1 and 5000, and `p`, a list of `n` integers where each element's absolute value is less than or equal to `n`. It initializes a `dp` list and performs iterative updates based on specific rules. After completing these updates, it calculates `final_sum` as the last element of `p` plus an offset, and returns the value at `dp[final_sum]`. This returned value represents the cumulative sum of all positive values in the original `dp` list, distributed across its indices from 1 to \(2 * n\) through multiple iterations of the loop, modulo `MOD`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a; p is a list of n integers where |pi| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])

        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The `index` will be `3 + 2t + n`, where `t` is the final value after the loop completes all its iterations, and `n` is the integer value obtained from `data[3]`. The variable `t` will be equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is an integer greater than or equal to 3 since we know it has already executed at least 3 times. The `t` value will be the sum of all `t` values from each iteration, meaning if the loop iterates `k` times, `t` will be `k`. The `n` value remains the same as it is derived from `data[3]` and does not change within the loop. The `p` list will be updated to the last list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers after the loop completes. The `data` list remains unchanged as no modifications are made to it within the loop. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, with the latest result being the most recent addition to the list.
    #
    #In summary, the `index` will be `3 + 2t + n`, `t` will be the total number of iterations, `n` will be the integer from `data[3]`, `p` will be the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` will remain unchanged, and `results` will be a list of results from each iteration of the loop.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: The `index` will be `3 + 2t + n`, where `t` is the total number of iterations (length of `results`), `n` is the integer from `data[3]`, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` remains unchanged, and `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls another function `func_1` for each test case. For each test case, it extracts the number of elements `n` and a list of integers `p`, then computes a result using `func_1`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of each test case. The function does not return any value but modifies internal states such as `index`, `results`, and retains the last processed list `p`.
