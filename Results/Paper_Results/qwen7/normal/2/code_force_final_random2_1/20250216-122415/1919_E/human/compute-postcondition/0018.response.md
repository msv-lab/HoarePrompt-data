Output State: **`index` is 5 + 2n, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` plus the new result.**

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_1(n, p)` to the variable `result`. The value of `index` remains `5 + 2n`, `t` remains greater than 1, `n` remains the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` remains a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `data` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, and `results` now includes the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
