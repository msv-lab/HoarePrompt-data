Output State: The final state of `new_dp` will be a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element is updated based on the values from `dp`. Specifically, for each index \(j\) in the range \(0\) to \(2n\), if `dp[j] > 0`, then `new_dp[j]` will be updated to \((new_dp[j] + dp[j]) \% MOD\). This update will happen for every valid `j` in the range as the loop iterates through all possible values of `j` from \(0\) to \(2n\).

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `new_dp` will contain the cumulative sum of `dp`'s non-zero values, modulo `MOD`, at each index, reflecting the influence of all valid `dp[j]` values across the entire range.
