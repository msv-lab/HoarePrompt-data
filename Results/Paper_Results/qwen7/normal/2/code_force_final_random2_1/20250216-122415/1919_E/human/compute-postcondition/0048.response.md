Postcondition: `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, where for every index `j` from 1 to \(2 * n\) (inclusive), `new_dp[j]` is the sum of all `dp[k]` where `dp[k] > 0`, modulo `MOD`, `i` is `m + 1`, and the current value of `new_dp[j]` is updated to `(new_dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD` for every `j` from 2 to \(2 * n\). Additionally, the condition `j - 1 >= 0` is satisfied.
