Output State: **`new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 filled with zeros, `j` is 1, and `dp[j - 1]` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Initially, `new_dp[j + 1]` is 0 because `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 filled with zeros. After the operation, `new_dp[j + 1]` becomes `dp[j] % MOD`. The values of `new_dp` for all other indices remain 0. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1. The value of `dp[j]` being greater than 0 is a precondition and remains unchanged.
