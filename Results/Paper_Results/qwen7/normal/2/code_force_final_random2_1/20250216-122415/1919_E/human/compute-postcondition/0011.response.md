Output State: **`index` is 4 + n, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| ≤ `n` and sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `p` is now a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers.**

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(n, p)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1(n, p)` to the variable `result`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `index` is 4 + n, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| ≤ `n` and sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is now a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, and `p` is now a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers.
