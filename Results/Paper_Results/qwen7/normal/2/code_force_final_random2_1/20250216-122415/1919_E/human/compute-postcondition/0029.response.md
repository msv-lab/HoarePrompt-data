Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `res` which is used to iterate over the `results` list.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `res`:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `results`, the initial value of `res` should be the first element of the `results` list.
   - Let's denote the length of the `results` list as `len(results) = k`, where `k` is the total number of iterations the loop will execute.

3. **Determine the Value of `t`:**
   - From the problem statement, `t` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, and it is given that the loop has already executed at least 3 times.
   - Therefore, `t` will be `k`, where `k` is the length of the `results` list.

4. **Determine the Value of `index`:**
   - The `index` is defined as `3 + 2t + n`.
   - Substituting `t` with `k`, we get `index = 3 + 2k + n`.

5. **Determine the Value of `n`:**
   - `n` is the integer value obtained from `data[3]` and remains constant throughout the loop.

6. **Determine the State of `p`:**
   - `p` is updated to the last list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers after the loop completes.
   - Since the loop has completed, `p` will be the list of integers from the last iteration.

7. **Determine the State of `data`:**
   - The `data` list remains unchanged as no modifications are made to it within the loop.

8. **Determine the State of `results`:**
   - `results` will contain the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, with the latest result being the most recent addition to the list.

### Final Adjusted State:

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `index` should be `3 + 2t + n`, where `t` is the total number of iterations (which is the length of the `results` list).
- `t` should be the total number of iterations, which is the length of the `results` list.
- `n` should be the integer value obtained from `data[3]`.
- `p` should be the list of integers from the last iteration.
- `data` should remain unchanged.
- `results` should contain the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, with the latest result being the most recent addition to the list.

### Final Answer:

State: **`index` is `3 + 2t + n`, `t` is the total number of iterations (length of `results`), `n` is the integer from `data[3]`, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` remains unchanged, and `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.**
