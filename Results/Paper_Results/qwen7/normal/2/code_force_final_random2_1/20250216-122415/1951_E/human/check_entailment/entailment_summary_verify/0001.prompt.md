You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Christopher Tin ft. Soweto Gospel Choir - Baba

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(ch):
    if len(ch) % 2 == 0:
        x = len(ch) // 2
    else:
        x = len(ch) // 2 + 1
    if ch[:len(ch) // 2] == ch[x:][::-1]:
        return True
    else:
        return False

#Function 2:
def func_2(ch):
    b = len(ch) // 2
    if len(ch) % 2 == 0:
        if func_1(ch[:b]):
            a = 3
        else:
            a = 4
    elif func_1(ch[:b]):
        a = 1
    else:
        a = 2
    return a



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a string `ch` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns one of four values (1, 2, 3, or 4) based on the outcome of calling `func_1` on the first half of the string `ch`. If the length of `ch` is even, it checks `func_1` on the first half of `ch` and sets `a` to 3 if true, otherwise to 4. If the length of `ch` is odd, it checks `func_1` on the first half of `ch` (excluding the middle character if present) and sets `a` to 1 if true, otherwise to 2. Finally, the function returns the value of `a`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - It splits the string into two halves and compares them.
   - If the length of the string is even, it checks if the first half equals the reverse of the second half.
   - If the length is odd, it checks if the first half (up to the middle) equals the reverse of the second half (from the middle to the end).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function determines how many parts a string can be split into such that none of the parts are palindromes.
   - It uses `func_1` to check if the first half of the string is a palindrome.
   - Depending on whether the string length is even or odd and whether the first half is a palindrome, it returns a value indicating the number of parts needed.

### Problem Description Recap

- We need to partition a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome.
- If such a partition exists, we should output "YES" and the number of parts and the parts themselves.
- If no such partition exists, we should output "NO".

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Function `func_2` Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed. It does not correctly determine the minimum number of parts needed to ensure no part is a palindrome.
   - For example, consider the string "abc". `func_2` will incorrectly return 3 instead of 1 because it checks the first half and makes assumptions about the entire string without considering all possible partitions.

2. **Handling Palindromes**:
   - The program does not actually attempt to find a valid partition. Instead, it relies on a flawed logic to determine the number of parts needed.
   - There is no code that attempts to partition the string and verify if the resulting parts are non-palindromic.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not handle the output format correctly. It should output "YES" or "NO" followed by the appropriate details if the answer is "YES".

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to implement the required logic for partitioning the string and checking for non-palindromic substrings.
