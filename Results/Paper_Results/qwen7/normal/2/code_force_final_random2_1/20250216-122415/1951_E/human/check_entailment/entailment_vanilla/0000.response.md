Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - It splits the string into two halves and compares them.
   - If the length of the string is even, it checks if the first half equals the reverse of the second half.
   - If the length is odd, it checks if the first half (up to the middle) equals the reverse of the second half (from the middle to the end).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function determines how many parts a string can be split into such that none of the parts are palindromes.
   - It uses `func_1` to check if the first half of the string is a palindrome.
   - Depending on whether the string length is even or odd and whether the first half is a palindrome, it returns a value indicating the number of parts needed.

### Problem Description Recap

- We need to partition a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome.
- If such a partition exists, we should output "YES" and the number of parts and the parts themselves.
- If no such partition exists, we should output "NO".

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Function `func_2` Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed. It does not correctly determine the minimum number of parts needed to ensure no part is a palindrome.
   - For example, consider the string "abc". `func_2` will incorrectly return 3 instead of 1 because it checks the first half and makes assumptions about the entire string without considering all possible partitions.

2. **Handling Palindromes**:
   - The program does not actually attempt to find a valid partition. Instead, it relies on a flawed logic to determine the number of parts needed.
   - There is no code that attempts to partition the string and verify if the resulting parts are non-palindromic.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not handle the output format correctly. It should output "YES" or "NO" followed by the appropriate details if the answer is "YES".

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to implement the required logic for partitioning the string and checking for non-palindromic substrings.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
