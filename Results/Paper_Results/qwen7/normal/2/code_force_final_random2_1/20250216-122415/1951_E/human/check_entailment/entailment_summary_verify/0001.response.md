### Reasoning

The original assessment accurately points out several issues with the provided program:

1. **Function `func_2` Logic**: The logic in `func_2` is indeed flawed. It does not correctly determine the minimum number of parts needed to ensure no part is a palindrome. For example, for the string "abc", `func_2` will incorrectly return 3 instead of 1.

2. **Handling Palindromes**: The program does not attempt to find a valid partition. Instead, it relies on a flawed logic to determine the number of parts needed.

3. **Output Format**: The program does not handle the output format correctly. It should output "YES" or "NO" followed by the appropriate details if the answer is "YES".

However, the original assessment does not provide a complete solution or an alternative implementation. Let's evaluate the program based on the given function summaries and the problem requirements.

### Re-evaluation

Given the function summaries, let's break down the functions and see if they can be used to solve the problem correctly:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if a string is a palindrome.
   - It splits the string into two halves and compares them, which is a valid approach for determining if a string is a palindrome.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function returns a value based on whether the first half of the string is a palindrome.
   - However, it does not provide a way to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

To solve the problem, we need to:
- Check if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- If possible, provide the partition.

Given the current implementation, `func_2` alone cannot achieve this. We need additional logic to partition the string and verify the partitions.

### Correct Solution Approach

We need to implement a function that:
1. Checks if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
2. If possible, provides the partition.

Here is a potential approach:
- Iterate through the string and try to partition it at each position.
- Check if the resulting substrings are non-palindromic.
- If a valid partition is found, output "YES" and the partition.
- If no valid partition is found, output "NO".

### Final Evaluation

Since the original program does not provide a correct solution and the function summaries do not offer a complete solution either, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
