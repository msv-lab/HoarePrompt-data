#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `ch` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns one of four values (1, 2, 3, or 4) based on the outcome of calling `func_1` on the first half of the string `ch`. If the length of `ch` is even, it checks `func_1` on the first half of `ch` and sets `a` to 3 if true, otherwise to 4. If the length of `ch` is odd, it checks `func_1` on the first half of `ch` (excluding the middle character if present) and sets `a` to 1 if true, otherwise to 2. Finally, the function returns the value of `a`.
