### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not attempt to solve the given problem. Let's break down the functions and their roles:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome. It does this by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. However, this function alone does not help in partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to determine a value based on whether the first half of the string (or the first half excluding the middle character if the length is odd) is a palindrome. The values returned (1, 2, 3, or 4) do not directly contribute to solving the problem of partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings. Instead, they seem to be part of a classification scheme based on the palindromic properties of the string.

Given the problem statement, the program needs to:
- Determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- If possible, provide such a partition.

The provided functions do not address these requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem as described.
