Precondition: **ch is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters and its length can be even or odd.** 

The function `func_2` seems to be checking if the first half of the string `ch` is a palindrome and then determining the number of parts `a` needed for the string to be partitioned such that none of the parts are palindromes. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, which makes it difficult to fully understand the logic. Based on the available information, we can still describe the precondition for `func_2`.
