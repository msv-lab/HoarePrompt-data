Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not attempt to solve the given problem. Instead, it contains two helper functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) that do not contribute to the solution of the problem. Specifically, `func_1` checks if a given string is a palindrome, and `func_2` seems to be an attempt to classify the length of a string based on its palindromic properties, but neither function is used to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Check if a given string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
2. If possible, provide such a partition.

Since the given code does not implement the required functionality, it is incorrect.
