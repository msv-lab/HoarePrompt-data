Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
3. It first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])`. If true, it prints "YES".
4. If the array is not sorted, it iterates through the array to find a possible split point `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`.
5. For each potential split point, it checks if the suffix `new = a[i:]` is non-decreasing (`new_all`) and if the prefix up to `i-1` is non-increasing (`check_all_new`).
6. If such a split is found that meets the criteria, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
7. If no such split is found after checking all possible points, it prints "NO".

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function appears to be correct. The program correctly identifies whether the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts as described.

Correctness: **True**
