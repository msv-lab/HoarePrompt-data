Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping in a way that allows the smaller part to come before the larger part. 

Consider the following example:
- Input:
```
3
6
1 2 3 2 1 4
```
- Expected Output:
```
Yes
```
- Actual Output:
```
No
```

The array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4]` can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. For instance, we can split it into `x = [1, 2, 3]` and `y = [2, 1, 4]`, then swap them to get `[2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3]`, which is not sorted but can be further adjusted to `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`. However, the current implementation does not account for such scenarios, leading to an incorrect output.
