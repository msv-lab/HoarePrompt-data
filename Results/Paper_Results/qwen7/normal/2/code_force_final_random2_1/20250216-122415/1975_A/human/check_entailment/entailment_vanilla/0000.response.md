### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Checking if Array is Already Sorted:**
   - The program checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position where the sequence breaks (`a[i-1] > a[i]`).
   - It then splits the array into two parts: `x` (the prefix ending at `i-1`) and `y` (the suffix starting from `i`).
   - It checks if the entire array can be made non-decreasing by ensuring:
     - All elements in `x` are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `y` (`check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`).
     - The array `y` itself is sorted in non-decreasing order (`new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'.
   - If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:
- The logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping is correct.
- The program handles all edge cases properly, such as when the array is already sorted or when no valid split exists.
- The program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
