Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be at least 3.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from `a[3:]`. This means `new` contains elements starting from the 4th element (index 3) of the list `a`.
   - `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`.
   - `new_all` is updated to `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`. This checks if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

Given the initial state, the code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`. There are no variables or conditions that affect this print statement.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
