Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, `check_all` is False, `i` is equal to `n`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list, and `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `check_all`, `i`, and `new_all` remain unchanged. The new value of `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `new` is updated to be a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end. `new_all` remains `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, which is true before the code is executed and remains true unless the order changes, but since no operations that could change the order are performed, it stays `True`.
