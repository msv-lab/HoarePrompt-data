Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` is `False`.
- `i` is `3`.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `3` to the end of the list.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
