Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and the output is either 'YES' or 'NO'. If `check_all` is true, the program checks if there exists a segment in `a` starting from any index `i` to the end where all elements are greater than or equal to `a[0]` and all elements are non-decreasing. If such a segment is found, the output is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'. If `check_all` is false, the output is 'NO'.**
