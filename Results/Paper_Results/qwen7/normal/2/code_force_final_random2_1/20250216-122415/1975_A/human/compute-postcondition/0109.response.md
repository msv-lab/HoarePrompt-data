Let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. `i` is set to 1.
2. `n` must be at least 2.
3. `new` is a list containing elements from `a[1:]`. This means `new` contains all elements of `a` starting from the second element.
4. `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`. Since `i` starts from 1, this condition checks if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to each element in `new`.
5. `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`. This checks if the list `new` is non-decreasing.
6. `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

- The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `check_all_new` and `new_all`, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
