Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is True if all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to the length of `new`.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
