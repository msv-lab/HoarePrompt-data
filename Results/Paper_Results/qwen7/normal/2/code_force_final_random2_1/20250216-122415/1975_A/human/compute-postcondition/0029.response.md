Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is True if all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `new`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
