Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers
- `check_all` is `False`
- `i` is 2
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list, so `new = a[2:]`
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, calculated as `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` without any reference to the variables or their values.

Output: **NO**
