Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `new` is a list containing elements from `a[1:]`. If `a[0] >= new[i]` for all `i` in the range of the length of `new` and `(new[i - 1] <= new[i])` holds for all consecutive elements in `new`, we break out of the loop or if statement. Otherwise, we also break out of the loop or if statement.
