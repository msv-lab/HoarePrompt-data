Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is 3, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list, `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
