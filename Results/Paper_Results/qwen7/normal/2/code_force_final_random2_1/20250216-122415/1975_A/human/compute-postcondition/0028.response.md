Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list `a`. Since `i` is 2, `new` starts from the third element of `a` and goes to the end.
- `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`. This means that all elements from `a[2]` to the end of the list should be greater than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is True if all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to the length of `new`. This means that the elements in `new` should be in non-decreasing order.

However, the print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all`. Therefore, the output is **YES**.
