Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `new` is a list starting from `a[0]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, and it is true.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to the length of `new`, and it is true.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
