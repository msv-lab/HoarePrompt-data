Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of the list), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. For each test case, it checks if the list \( a \) is non-decreasing. If the list is non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if the list can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing. If such a split exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the variable \( t \) is set to 0, indicating the end of processing.**
