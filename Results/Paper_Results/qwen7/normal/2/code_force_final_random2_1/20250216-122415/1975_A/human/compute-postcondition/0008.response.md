Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the integer `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**: 
   - `i` should start at 1 because the loop starts from `range(1, n)`.
   - `n` is an input integer, but we need to ensure it is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Check the initial state of other objects**:
   - `t` being greater than 0 does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `a` is a list of integers, but its contents do not affect the loop's execution.
   - `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether at least one element in `a` (except the first one) is less than the previous element. This does not affect the loop's execution either.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, we need to ensure `i` is 1.
   - We need to ensure `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
