### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Checking if Array is Already Sorted:**
   - The program checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position where the sequence breaks (`a[i-1] > a[i]`).
   - It then splits the array into two parts: `x` (the prefix ending at `i-1`) and `y` (the suffix starting from `i`).
   - It checks if the entire array can be made non-decreasing by ensuring:
     - All elements in `x` are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `y` (`check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`).
     - The array `y` itself is sorted in non-decreasing order (`new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'.
   - If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:
- The logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping is correct.
- However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the condition `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`. This condition checks if the first element of the original array `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix `y`. This is incorrect because it should check if the first element of the prefix `x` is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix `y`.

### Corrected Logic:
To fix this, we need to ensure that the first element of the prefix `x` (which is `a[i-1]`) is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix `y`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[i-1] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment incorrectly assumed that the condition `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` was correct. After correcting this, the program should now correctly determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed condition `check_all_new`. The corrected program should be used instead.

### Final: **False**
