Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks for a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` that should generate `.py` files based on the `.html` files found in specific subfolders within a given range. However, the provided code does not implement this functionality at all. Instead, it contains a separate function `func_1()` which processes strings and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. This function does not interact with file generation or directory traversal as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
