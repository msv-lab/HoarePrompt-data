Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
