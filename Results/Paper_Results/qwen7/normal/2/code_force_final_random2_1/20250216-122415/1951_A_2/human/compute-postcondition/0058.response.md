Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a binary string `arr`. For each test case, it checks if the string contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, or if the number of '1's is even. If either condition is met, it appends 'no' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'yes'. After processing all test cases, it prints the contents of the results list.**
