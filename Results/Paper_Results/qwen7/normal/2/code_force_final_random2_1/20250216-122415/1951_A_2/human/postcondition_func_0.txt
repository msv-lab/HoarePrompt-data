The function processes multiple inputs, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a string `s`. It checks the string `s` for specific conditions related to the count of '1' characters and the presence of '11'. Based on these conditions, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. The function does not modify any external variables and does not accept any parameters.
