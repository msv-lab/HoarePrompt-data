Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer, start is an integer, end is an integer such that start <= end, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The values of `t`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged from their initial state.
