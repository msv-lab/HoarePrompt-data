Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` and another integer `n`, followed by `2n` integers representing numbers on a whiteboard. It then sorts these numbers in ascending order and calculates the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs from the sorted list. Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case.**
