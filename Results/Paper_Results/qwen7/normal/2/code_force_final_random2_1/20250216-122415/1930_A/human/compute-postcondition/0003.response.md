Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `numbers = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `numbers`. The initial values of `numCases` and `i` remain unchanged, and `numInteger` remains an input integer, though its specific value is not known without further input.
