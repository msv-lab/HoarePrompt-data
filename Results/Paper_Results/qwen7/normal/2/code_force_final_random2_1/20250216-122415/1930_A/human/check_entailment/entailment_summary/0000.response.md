Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the maximum final score by always choosing the two smallest numbers from the sorted list and adding their minimum value to the score. This approach ensures that the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs is maximized, which aligns with the requirement to achieve the highest possible score.

Let's break down the program's logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4. It iteratively pops the first two elements from the sorted list, calculates their minimum, and adds this value to the total score.
5. Finally, it prints the total score for each test case.

This logic correctly implements the strategy of always selecting the two smallest numbers to maximize the score. The sorting step ensures that the smallest numbers are always chosen first, and the use of `pop(0)` ensures that the next smallest numbers are selected in subsequent iterations.

Given the problem description and the provided execution summary, the program correctly implements the required algorithm to find the maximum final score.

Correctness: **True**
