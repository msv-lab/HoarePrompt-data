Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs of integers from the original `numbers` list, `a` is the last element processed (if any), `b` is the last element processed (if any), `numInteger` is an integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `numInteger = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `numInteger`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
