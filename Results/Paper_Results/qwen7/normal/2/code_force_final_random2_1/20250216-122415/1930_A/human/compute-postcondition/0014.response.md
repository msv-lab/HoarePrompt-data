The only variable in the loop head is the `numbers` list, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. For the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list must still contain at least one element.

At the end of the last iteration, the `numbers` list has at least one less element. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list must have had at least two elements initially and now must still contain at least one element.

State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` must have at least one element, `suma` is the sum of the minimum of the first two elements of the original `numbers` plus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `a` is the first element of the original `numbers`, `b` is the value of the element that was removed from `numbers`.**
