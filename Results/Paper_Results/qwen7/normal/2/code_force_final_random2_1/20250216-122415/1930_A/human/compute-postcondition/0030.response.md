The only variable in the loop head is the list `numbers`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings starting with the second smallest number.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `numbers` must still be a non-empty list. Since the loop removes elements from `numbers` during each iteration, the current state indicates that `numbers` has at least one element left.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the given states because `numbers` is already non-empty.

State: **`suma` is 2, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings starting with the second smallest number, `a` is the first element of `numbers` converted to an integer, `b` is the first element of `numbers` converted to an integer**
