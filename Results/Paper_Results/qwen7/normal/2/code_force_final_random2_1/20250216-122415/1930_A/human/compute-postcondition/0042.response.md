Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `a` is the last element processed (if any), `b` is the last element processed (if any)**.

Explanation: The code `numInteger = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `numInteger`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
