Output State: **`suma` is 4, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings starting with the second smallest number except the first element, `a` is the first element of the updated `numbers` list converted to an integer, `b` is the first element of the original `numbers` list converted to an integer, and `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping the first element and converting it to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the `numbers` list and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` now holds the value of the first element of the original `numbers` list after it has been popped and converted to an integer.
