Output State: **`numCases` is an input integer, and the values of `t` and `n` and the numbers on the whiteboard are unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `numCases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numCases`. The initial values of `t` and `n`, and the numbers on the whiteboard remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers on the whiteboard are still 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
