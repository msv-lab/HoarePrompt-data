Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings sorted in ascending order, `a` is the first element of the original list converted to an integer minus the first element, `b` is the first element of the updated list (which is now the second element of the original list) processed (if any), `suma` is `min(a, b)` and `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings sorted in ascending order with its first element removed.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `a`. The precondition that `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings sorted in ascending order remains valid, but it now has one less element. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
