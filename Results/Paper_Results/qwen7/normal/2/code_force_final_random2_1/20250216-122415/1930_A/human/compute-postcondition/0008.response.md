Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list with at least one element less than before, `suma` is 0, `b` is the first element of `numbers` before popping.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the list `numbers` and assigns it to the variable `b`. Since `numbers` had at least one element before popping, it now has at least one element less than before. All other variables remain unchanged.
