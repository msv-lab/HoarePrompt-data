Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings sorted in ascending order with the first element removed, `a` is the first element of the original list converted to an integer, `b` is the first element of the updated list (which is now the second element of the original list) processed (if any), `suma` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` removes the first element from the `numbers` list and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `b`. The `numbers` list is updated to exclude its first element. All other variables remain unchanged.
