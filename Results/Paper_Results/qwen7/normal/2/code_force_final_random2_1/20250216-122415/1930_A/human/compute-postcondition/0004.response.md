Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of strings sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `numbers.sort(reverse=False)` sorts the list `numbers` in ascending order (since `reverse=False` is the default behavior). The values of `numCases`, `i`, and `numInteger` remain unchanged.
