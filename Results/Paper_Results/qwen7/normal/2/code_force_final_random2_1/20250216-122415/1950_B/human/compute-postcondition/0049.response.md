Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is explicitly set to 1.
- `casos` is a positive integer greater than 0 but its specific value is not given.
- `n` is an input integer that is either equal to 1 or not equal to 2. Since the value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, it could be either 1 or any other integer except 2.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `##`.

Output: **##**
