Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is explicitly given as 1.
- `casos` is a positive integer greater than 0, but its specific value is not needed for the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer that is either equal to 1 or not equal to 2. The value of `n` is assigned using `int(input())`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('##')
```

This statement will print the string `##` regardless of the values of `c`, `casos`, and `n`.

Output: **##**
