Postcondition: **`c` is 1, `casos` must be a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that is either equal to 1 or not equal to 2, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since the conditions and assignments do not change within the if or else blocks.
