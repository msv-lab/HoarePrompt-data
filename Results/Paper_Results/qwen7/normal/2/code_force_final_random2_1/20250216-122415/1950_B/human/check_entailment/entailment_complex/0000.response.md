Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly generate the required 2n x 2n checkerboard for values of \( n \) outside the range 1 to 4. Specifically, the program only handles \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \). For any other value of \( n \), the program simply prints "No esta en el rango", which is not the expected behavior according to the problem statement. The problem requires generating a 2n x 2n checkerboard with alternating '#' and '.' for any \( n \) within the given constraints, not just for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \).

Correctness: **False**
