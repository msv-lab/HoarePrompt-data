Reasoning:
The given program only handles the specific cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. According to the problem description, the program should generate a 2n x 2n checkerboard for any `n` in the range 1 to 20, with the top-left cell being '#'. The current implementation does not handle other values of `n` beyond 4, which violates the problem constraints. Additionally, the program does not follow the checkerboard pattern correctly for `n > 4`.

For example, when `n = 5`, the expected output would be a 10x10 checkerboard, but the program does not provide this functionality. Instead, it prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range") for any `n` outside the range 1 to 4.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not generate the correct checkerboard for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
