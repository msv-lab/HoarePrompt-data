Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is explicitly set to 1.
- `casos` is a positive integer greater than 0, but its specific value is not provided.
- `n` is an input integer that is either equal to 1 or not equal to 2. Since the value of `n` is determined by `int(input())`, we cannot know its exact value without knowing the user's input, but it is guaranteed to be either 1 or any other number except 2.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print('No esta en el rango')
```

This statement will always print the string `'No esta en el rango'` regardless of the values of `c`, `casos`, and `n`.

Output: **No esta en el rango**
