The print statement `print('..##..')` directly outputs a string literal `'..##..'`.

Given the initial state, the variables `c`, `casos`, and `n` have specific values, but these do not affect the execution of the print statement. The string `'..##..'` is hardcoded and will be printed as is.

Output: **..##..**
