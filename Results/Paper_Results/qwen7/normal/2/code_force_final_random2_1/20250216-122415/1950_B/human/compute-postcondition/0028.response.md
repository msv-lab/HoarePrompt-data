The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `c` is 0.
- `casos` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer, and it is explicitly stated that `n` is equal to 4.

The `print` statement to be executed is:
```python
print('##..##..')
```

This statement will print the exact string `'##..##..'` to the console. Since no variables from the initial state are used within this print statement, the output will simply be the string itself.

Output: **##..##..**
