Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is 0.
- `casos` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `n` is not equal to 4.

The print statement is:
```python
print('No esta en el rango')
```

This print statement outputs a string literal 'No esta en el rango', which translates to 'Not in range' in English. Since the value of `c`, `casos`, and `n` do not affect this specific print statement, the output remains constant regardless of their values.

Output: **'No esta en el rango'**
