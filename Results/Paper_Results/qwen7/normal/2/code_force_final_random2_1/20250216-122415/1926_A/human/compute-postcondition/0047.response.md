Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in a`. This means the loop variable `j` is derived from the iterable `a`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that `j` is the next string in `a`. Additionally, if `j` equals 'A', then `l` is increased by 1; otherwise, `h` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the next string in `a`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the next string in `a`.
   - Depending on the value of `j`, either `l` or `h` was incremented.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- The variable `j` will be the next string in `a`.
- Either `l` or `h` will be incremented based on the value of `j`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we can only say that `j` will be the next string in `a`. The increments of `l` or `h` depend on the value of `j`, but we cannot specify which one without additional information.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `j` is the next string in `a`.

**State: **`j` is the next string in `a`**.
