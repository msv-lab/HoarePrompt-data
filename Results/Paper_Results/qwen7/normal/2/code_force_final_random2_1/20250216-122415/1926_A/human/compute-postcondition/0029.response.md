Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty string, `l` is the total number of 'A's in the original string `a`, and `h` is the total number of characters in `a` that are not 'A's. If the number of 'A's (`l`) is greater than the number of non-'A's (`h`), then `l` equals the total number of 'A's and `h` equals the total number of non-'A's. Otherwise, `l` is a non-negative integer (either 1, 2, ..., or the total number of 'A's in the original string `a`), and `h` is a non-negative integer (either 1, 2, ..., or the total number of characters in `a` that are not 'A's).**
