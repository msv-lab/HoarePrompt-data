Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a = input()
    l = 0
    h = 0
    for j in a:
        if j == 'A':
            l += 1
        else:
            h += 1
    if l > h:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty string, `l` is the total number of 'A's in the original string `a`, and `h` is the total number of characters in `a` that are not 'A's. If the number of 'A's (`l`) is greater than the number of non-'A's (`h`), then `l` equals the total number of 'A's and `h` equals the total number of non-'A's. Otherwise, `l` is a non-negative integer (either 1, 2, ..., or the total number of 'A's in the original string `a`), and `h` is a non-negative integer (either 1, 2, ..., or the total number of characters in `a` that are not 'A's).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All characters in the string `a` have been processed; `l` represents the total count of 'A' characters, and `h` represents the total count of non-'A' characters. If the count of 'A' characters (`l`) is greater than the count of non-'A' characters (`h`), then `l` remains unchanged and `h` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged and `h` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` represents the total number of 'A' elements in list `a`, and `h` represents the total number of elements in `a` that are not 'A'. The variable `i` will be 1 more than its final value from the last iteration, and `t` remains the same as its initial value. Additionally, the length of `a` is either greater than `h` or the condition `l <= h` holds true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
