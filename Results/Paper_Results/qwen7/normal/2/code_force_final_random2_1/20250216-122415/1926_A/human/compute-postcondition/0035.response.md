Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` which is iterating over the elements of the string `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - `j` is not explicitly initialized in the loop head; it is being assigned values from the string `a`.
   - `a` is the input string.
   - `l` and `h` are both initialized to 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in the string `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is being assigned values from `a`, it will start with the first character of `a` and increment through each character until `a` is exhausted.
   - `a` must be a non-empty string for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `l` and `h` are not directly involved in the loop condition but might be modified within the loop body. However, since the problem asks to adjust the states for the loop to execute, we focus on `a`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `a` must be a non-empty string.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `l` is 0, `h` is 0**
