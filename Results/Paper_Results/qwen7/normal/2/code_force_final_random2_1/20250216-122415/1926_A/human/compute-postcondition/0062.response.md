Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in a:`. The objects involved here are `j` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `h` is 0.
   - `i` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `t` remains the same.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `a` is the iterable in the loop, it must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `l`, `h`, `i`, and `t` do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they should reflect their current states as given.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `a` must contain at least one element.
- `l` is 0.
- `h` is 0.
- `i` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `t` remains the same.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `a` must contain at least one element, `l` is 0, `h` is 0, `i` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `t` remains the same**.
