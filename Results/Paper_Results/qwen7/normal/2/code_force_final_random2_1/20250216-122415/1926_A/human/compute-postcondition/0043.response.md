Output State: **`j` is the next string in `a`; `l` is increased by 1**.

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, while the value of `j` remains as the next string in `a`. The initial state of `j` being the next string in `a` and `l` being some unspecified initial value are preserved, with `l` now being that initial value plus 1.
