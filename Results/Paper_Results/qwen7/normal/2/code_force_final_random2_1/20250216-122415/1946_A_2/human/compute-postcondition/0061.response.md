Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `new_median <= median`.

2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `op` is 1
   - `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string
   - `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3
   - `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2
   - `new_median` is `b[ma]`
   - `median` is `b[ma] + 1`
   - `b[ma]` is greater than or equal to 4
   - `b` is explicitly sorted

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition is `new_median <= median`.
   - For the loop to continue, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.
   - Given that `new_median = b[ma]` and `median = b[ma] + 1`, the current state has `new_median = b[ma]` and `median = b[ma] + 1`.
   - Since `b[ma]` is greater than or equal to 4, `new_median` is also greater than or equal to 4.
   - To make the loop continue, `new_median` must be less than `median`, which means `b[ma]` must be less than `b[ma] + 1`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The only way to make `new_median` less than `median` is to change `b[ma]` such that `b[ma]` becomes less than `b[ma] + 1`.
   - This can be achieved by decreasing `b[ma]` by 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

**State: `op` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma] - 1`, `median` is `b[ma]`, `b[ma]` is greater than or equal to 3, and `b` is explicitly sorted.**
