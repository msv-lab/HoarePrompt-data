Output State: **`op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, and `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified within the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program will exit the current block and move to the next line of code. None of the variables are modified by this statement, so their previous values remain unchanged.
