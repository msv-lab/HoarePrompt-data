Output State: `op` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string from the user, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `median` is `b[ma] + 3, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `b[ma]` until `new_median` exceeds `median`. Since the loop executes 3 times, it increments `b[ma]` by 1 three times. Therefore, `b[ma]` will be incremented by 3 in total. As a result, both `new_median` and `median` will also be `b[ma] + 3`. The value of `op` will be 3 after the loop completes all its iterations. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
