Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], and `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` is updated to reflect the new list of integers.
