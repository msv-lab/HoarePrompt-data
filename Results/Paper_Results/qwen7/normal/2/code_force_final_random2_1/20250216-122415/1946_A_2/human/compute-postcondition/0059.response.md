The code `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b` again, but since `b` is already sorted (as per the initial state), sorting it again does not change its order. Therefore, the values of `b`, `ma`, `new_median`, and `median` remain unchanged. The only difference is that `b` is explicitly mentioned to be sorted.

Output State: **`op` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 4`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, and `b[ma]` is greater than or equal to 4; `b` is explicitly sorted.**
