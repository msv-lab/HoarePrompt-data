Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of the array. An operation consists of incrementing any element of the array by 1.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It calculates the index `p` of the median, which is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
   - It counts how many times the element at index `p` appears in the sorted array `a` and prints this count.

3. **Analysis of the Given Solution**:
   - The code correctly sorts the array.
   - The calculation of the median index `p` is correct.
   - However, the logic to determine the minimum number of operations to increase the median is flawed. Counting the occurrences of the current median does not provide the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To increase the median, we need to consider the value at the median position after sorting.
   - We should check if the current median is already the smallest possible value that could be greater than the current median.
   - If the current median is the smallest value in the array, no operations are needed.
   - Otherwise, the number of operations needed is the difference between the current median and the next smallest value that can replace the current median to make it the new median.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
   - Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
