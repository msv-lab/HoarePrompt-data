Output State: **`op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted with each element increased by 3, `ma` is int(`num2` / 2), `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted again, `i` is `num`, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `a` is updated to contain integers from `case` split and filtered.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num2` divided by 2 (integer division) to `ma`. This operation does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `new_median`, `median`, `b` (which is sorted again), `i`, `num2`, `case`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that `ma` now holds the value of `int(num2 / 2)`.
