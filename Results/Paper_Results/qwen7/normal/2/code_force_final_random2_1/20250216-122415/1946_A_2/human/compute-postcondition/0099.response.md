Output State: **`op` is 2, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either `int(num2 / 2) - 1` or `int(num2 / 2)`, `new_median` is decreased by at least 1, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted again (but remains the same), `i` is `num`, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `a` is updated to contain integers from `case` split and filtered, `median` is reassigned to `b[ma] + 1`, `new_median` is reassigned to `b[ma]`, `b[ma]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `op` is incremented by 1, so `op` becomes 2.
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `ma`, `new_median`, `median`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, `a`, `median`, `new_median`, and `b[ma]`) remain unchanged from their previous states as no operations were performed on them other than the reassignment of `median` and `new_median`.
