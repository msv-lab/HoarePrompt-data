Output State: **`op` is 3, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted again (which does not change its order).**

Explanation: The line `new_median = b[ma]` simply assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. The value of `b`, `ma`, and `new_median` changes, but the rest of the variables remain unchanged. Since `b` is already sorted and then sorted again, the order remains the same.
