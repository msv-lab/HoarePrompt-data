Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The logic in the current implementation is flawed because:

1. **Counting Operations**: The code counts the occurrences of the current median (`a[p]`) in the array `a`. However, this count does not represent the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

2. **Increasing Median**: To increase the median, we need to find the difference between the current median and the next greater value in the sorted array, or the smallest value that is greater than the current median. The solution should focus on finding the smallest number of increments needed to make the median strictly greater than its current value.

Here's a corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        median = a[p]
        
        # Find the smallest number of operations needed to increase the median
        if n % 2 == 1:  # If n is odd
            if a[p] < a[p + 1]:
                # Need to increment the median to the next value
                res = a[p + 1] - a[p]
            else:
                # Increment the median itself
                res = 1
        else:  # If n is even
            if a[p] < a[p + 1]:
                # Need to increment the median to the next value
                res = a[p + 1] - a[p]
            else:
                # Increment the median itself
                res = 1
        
        print(res)

func()
```

This corrected function calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median by ensuring that the median becomes strictly greater than its current value.
