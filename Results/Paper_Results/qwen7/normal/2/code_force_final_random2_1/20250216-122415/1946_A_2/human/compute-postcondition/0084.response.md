Output State: **`op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted, `i` is `num`, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `a` is updated to contain integers from `case` split and filtered.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `a` to contain integers from the `case` string after splitting and filtering. The filtering ensures that only digit strings are converted to integers. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
