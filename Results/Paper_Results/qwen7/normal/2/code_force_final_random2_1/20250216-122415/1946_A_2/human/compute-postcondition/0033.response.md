Output State: **`op` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string from the user, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `median` is `b[ma] + 1, `b[ma]` is increased by 1.**

The value of `op` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `t`, `i`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `a`, `b`, `ma`, `median`, and `b[ma]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
