Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is `num`, `num` is the input integer, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string from the user, `op` is 3 * `num`, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3 * `num`, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, and `new_median` is `b[ma]`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will equal `num` because the loop runs from 0 to `num-1`. The variable `op` will accumulate the value 3 for each iteration, resulting in `op` being 3 times the number of iterations, which is `3 * num`. The lists `a` and `b` will be updated according to the operations performed within the loop, with each element in `b` increased by 3 for each iteration. The variable `ma` will be recalculated based on the final value of `num2`, and `new_median` will be the value at the recalculated `ma` index in the sorted list `b`.
