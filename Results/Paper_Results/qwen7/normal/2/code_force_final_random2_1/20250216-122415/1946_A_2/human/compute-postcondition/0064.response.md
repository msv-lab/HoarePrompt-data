`op` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged as the code does not affect their values. Therefore, the output state is: `op` is 2, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 2`, `median` is `b[ma] + 2`, `b[ma]` is now greater than or equal to 5; `b` is explicitly sorted.
