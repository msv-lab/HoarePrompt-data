Output State: **`op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, and `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`, `median` is `b[ma]`**.

Explanation: The code `median = b[ma]` simply assigns the value of `b[ma]` to the variable `median`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `median` now holds the value of `b[ma]`, while all other variables retain their previous states.
