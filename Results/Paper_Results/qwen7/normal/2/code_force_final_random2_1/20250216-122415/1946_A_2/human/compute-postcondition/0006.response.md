Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`**.

This means that the variable `p` has been calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
