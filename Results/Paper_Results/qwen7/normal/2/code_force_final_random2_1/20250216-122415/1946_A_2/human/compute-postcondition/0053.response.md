Postcondition: `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, and `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`. This holds true regardless of whether `num2` is even or odd, as the value of `ma` and the calculation of `new_median` adapt accordingly.
