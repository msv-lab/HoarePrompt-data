Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1**.

This means that `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, where `n` is the input integer and `a` remains unchanged as a sorted list of integers obtained from the input string.
