Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `num`, `num` is the original input integer, `num2` is the last input integer processed within the loop, `case` is the last input string processed within the loop, `op` is the total number of operations performed across all iterations of the loop, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is the index of `b` increased by 1, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]`, `median` is `b[ma]`, and `b` remains sorted.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, and the value of `i` is now equal to `num`. The variable `op` holds the cumulative count of operations performed over all iterations. The lists `a` and `b` are derived from the last input string `case`, with `b` being a sorted list where each element is incremented by 3, and `ma` is recalculated based on the final value of `num2`.
