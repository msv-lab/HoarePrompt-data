Reasoning:
1. The provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function calculates the count of the middle element in the sorted array, which is not the same as finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
2. The problem requires increasing the median of the array by performing operations to increment specific elements. The current function simply counts the occurrences of the middle element in the sorted array, which is not related to the problem's requirements.
3. To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
   - Find the median of the array.
   - Determine the number of operations needed to make the median greater than its current value.

Given the provided code does not implement the logic to solve the problem as described, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
