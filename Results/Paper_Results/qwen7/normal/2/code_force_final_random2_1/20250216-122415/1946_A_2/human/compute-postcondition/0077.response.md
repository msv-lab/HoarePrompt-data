Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(0, num)`. The only variables involved here are `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `num`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `op` is 3
   - `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string
   - `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3
   - `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2
   - `new_median` is `b[ma]`
   - `median` is `b[ma] + 1`
   - `b` is explicitly sorted

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `num - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `num`.

5. **Maintain Other States**: The other states (`op`, `a`, `b`, `ma`, `new_median`, `median`, and `b`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`op` is 3, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted, `i` is `num`**
