Output State: `op` is 3, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `op` will be 3 since the loop condition `new_median <= median` is no longer satisfied. The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The list `b` is sorted and each element is increased by 3, and `ma` is determined based on `num2`. The value of `new_median` is `b[ma]` and `median` is `b[ma] + 1`. Since the loop has completed, `b` is sorted one last time, but given that the elements in `b` have been incremented and the list is already sorted, sorting it again does not change its order.
