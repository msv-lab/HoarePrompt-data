Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `new_median <= median`.

2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `op` is 1
   - `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string
   - `b` is sorted with each element increased by 3
   - `ma` is either `int(num2 / 2) - 1` or `int(num2 / 2)`
   - `new_median` is `b[ma] + 1`
   - `median` is `b[ma] + 1`
   - `b` is explicitly sorted again (but remains the same)
   - `i` is `num`
   - `num2` is an input integer
   - `case` is the input string
   - `a` is updated to contain integers from `case` split and filtered
   - `median` is reassigned to `b[ma] + 1`
   - `new_median` is reassigned to `b[ma]`

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition depends on `new_median` and `median`.
   - Since `new_median` and `median` are both set to `b[ma] + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, they are equal.
   - For the loop to continue, `new_median` must be less than `median` in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - To ensure `new_median` is less than `median` in the next iteration, we need to change the value of `new_median` such that it becomes less than `median`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `new_median`. We need to decrease its value by at least 1 so that `new_median` is less than `median`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`op` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either `int(num2 / 2) - 1` or `int(num2 / 2)`, `new_median` is decreased by at least 1, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted again (but remains the same), `i` is `num`, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `a` is updated to contain integers from `case` split and filtered, `median` is reassigned to `b[ma] + 1, new_median` is reassigned to `b[ma]`**
