Output State: **`op` is now the result of `val` >> `i` & 1 ^ `op`, `a` is a list with at least one element, `ai` is `ai` ^ `val`, `val` remains unchanged, `t` is a list containing the elements 0 and `ai` ^ `val`.**

Explanation: The code `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Initially, `t` contains only the element 0. After appending `ai ^ val`, `t` now contains two elements: 0 and `ai ^ val`. All other variables remain unchanged.
