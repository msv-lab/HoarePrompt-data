Output State: **`op` is now the result of `val` >> `i` & 1 ^ `op`, `a` is a list with at least one element, `ai` remains unchanged, `val` remains unchanged, `t` is a list containing the element 0**.

Explanation: The operation `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies `op` by performing a bitwise XOR (`^`) between its current value and the result of `val >> i & 1`. Here, `val >> i & 1` shifts `val` right by `i` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with 1, which effectively extracts the `i`-th bit of `val`. The result of this operation is then XORed with `op`, updating its value. The other variables remain unchanged.
