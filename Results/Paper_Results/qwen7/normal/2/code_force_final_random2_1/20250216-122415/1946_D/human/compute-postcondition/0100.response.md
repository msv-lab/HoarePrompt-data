Output State: **`op` is now the result of `val` >> `i` & 1 ^ (`val` >> `i` & 1), `a` is a list with at least two elements, `ai` is `val ^ ai`, `val` remains unchanged, `t` is a list containing the elements 0, 0, and `ai`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Initially, `t` contains the elements 0 and 0. After appending `ai`, `t` will contain the elements 0, 0, and `ai`. All other variables remain unchanged.
