Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
