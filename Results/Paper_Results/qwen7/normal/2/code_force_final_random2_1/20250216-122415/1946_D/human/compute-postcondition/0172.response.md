Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or the maximum of -1 and the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, `i` is 2, `u` is not 0, and `v` is even, and the current value of `v` is odd.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
