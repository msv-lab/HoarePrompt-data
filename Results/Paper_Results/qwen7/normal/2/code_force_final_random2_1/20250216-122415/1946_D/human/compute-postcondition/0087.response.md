Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element; `op` is 0; `ai` is 0; `val` is unchanged; `t` is a list containing the element 0.**

Explanation: The code `ai = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `ai`. All other variables (`a`, `op`, `val`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `t` now contains the element `ai`, which is 0.
