Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or the maximum of -1 and the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, `i` is 2, `u` is 0, and `v` is even.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any of the variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
