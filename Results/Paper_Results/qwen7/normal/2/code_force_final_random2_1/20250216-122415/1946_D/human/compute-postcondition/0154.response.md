Output State: **`ai` is `ai ^ (val ^ val)`, `i` is 3, `op` is `op ^ (val >> 3 & 1)`**

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between its current value and `val`. Since `val` is XORed with itself, the result is 0. Thus, `ai` becomes `ai ^ val ^ val`, which simplifies to `ai ^ 0`, and since anything XORed with 0 remains unchanged, `ai` stays the same. The values of `i` and `op` remain unaffected.
