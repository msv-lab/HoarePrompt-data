Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` and an integer `x`. It iterates over the bits of `x` and compares them with the corresponding bits of the integers in `a`. Based on these comparisons, it updates a counter `ans` which tracks the maximum number of times a specific condition is met during the iterations. Finally, it returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. If no valid operations are performed, it returns -1.**
