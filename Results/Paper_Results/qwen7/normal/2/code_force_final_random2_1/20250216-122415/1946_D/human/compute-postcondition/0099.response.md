Output State: **`op` is now the result of `val` >> `i` & 1 ^ (`val` >> `i` & 1), `a` is a list with at least two elements, `ai` is `val ^ ai`, `val` remains unchanged, `t` is a list containing the elements 0 and 0.**

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
