Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an empty list.
   - `ans` is -1.
   - `i` is 29.
   - `u` is 0.
   - `v` is either 0 or an odd number.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(29, -1, -1):
   ```

3. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `i = 29` to `i = 0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 29.

5. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by `-1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `28`.

6. **States to Adjust:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to update the value of `i` to `28`.

7. **Other Variables:**
   - `t`, `ans`, `u`, and `v` are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop itself. They will retain their current values unless modified within the loop body.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` should be updated to `28`.

Thus, the updated state is:

**State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is 0, `v` is either 0 or an odd number.**
