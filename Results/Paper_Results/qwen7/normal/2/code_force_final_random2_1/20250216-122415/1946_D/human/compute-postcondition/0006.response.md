Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is 0**.

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values or affect the state of the program. It simply skips to the next iteration of the loop (if there was one). Since no loop was specified in the initial state or the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
