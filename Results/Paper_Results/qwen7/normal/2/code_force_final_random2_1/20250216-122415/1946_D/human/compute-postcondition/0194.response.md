Output State: **`ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `cnt`; `cnt` retains its previous value; `i`, `u`, `v`, and `t` retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged because the code only updates `ans` and does not modify `cnt` further. The values of `i`, `u`, `v`, and `t` remain the same as they were in the initial state since no operations are performed on them in the given code snippet.
