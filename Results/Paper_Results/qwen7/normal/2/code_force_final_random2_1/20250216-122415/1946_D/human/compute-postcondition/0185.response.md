Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` xor (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then bitwise ANDed with 1), `cnt` is equal to 2**.

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was equal to 1. After executing the code, `cnt` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
