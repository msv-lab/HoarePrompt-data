Postcondition: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or the maximum of -1 and the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, `i` is 0, `u` is 0, and `v` is even.**

This means that after executing the if-else block, the list `t` remains empty, `ans` will be -1 if `v` is odd (in which case the if part is executed), or it will be the maximum of -1 and the count of times `op` became 0 during the loop if `v` is even (in which case the else part is executed). Additionally, `i` is set to 0, `u` is set to 0, and `v` is guaranteed to be even.
