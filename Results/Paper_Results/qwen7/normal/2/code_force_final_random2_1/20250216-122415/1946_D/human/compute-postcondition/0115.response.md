Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is 0, `v` is even, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `a` must not be an empty list**

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` is 0, so after executing the code, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
