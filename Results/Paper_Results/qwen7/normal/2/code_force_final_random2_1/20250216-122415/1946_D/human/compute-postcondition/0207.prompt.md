You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, x) is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30; a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.
def func_5():
    n, x = func_3()
    a = func_1()
    t, ans = [], -1
    for i in range(29, -1, -1):
        u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
        
        if u == v == 0:
            continue
        
        if u == 0:
            if v % 2:
                return ans
            else:
                op = ai = 0
                for val in a:
                    op ^= val >> i & 1
                    ai ^= val
                    if not op:
                        t.append(ai)
                        ai = 0
                a, t = t, []
        elif v % 2:
            continue
        elif v:
            op = cnt = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                if not op:
                    cnt += 1
            ans = max(ans, cnt)
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum count of times `op` became 0 during any iteration of the loop, `i` is 0, `u` is 0, and `v` is 0.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between ans (which is the maximum count of times op became 0 during any iteration of the loop) and len(a) (which is the length of list a)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns -1 unless the maximum count of times `op` became 0 during any iteration of the loop is greater than the length of list `a`, in which case it returns the maximum value between this count and the length of list `a`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1

Case_2: The program returns -1

Case_3: The program returns -1 or the maximum of -1 and the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, but since no information about `op` is given and the values of `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged, the program returns -1.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between ans (which is the maximum count of times op became 0 during any iteration of the loop) and len(a) (which is the length of list a)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
