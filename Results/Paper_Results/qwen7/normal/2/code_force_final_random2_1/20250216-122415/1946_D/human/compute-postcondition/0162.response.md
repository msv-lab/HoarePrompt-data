Output State: **`ai` is 2, `i` is 2, `op` is `op ^ (val >> 2 & 1)`, `t` is a list containing two elements `[2, 2]`, and `val` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` (which is 2) to the list `t`. Initially, `t` contains one element, which is `[ai ^ (val ^ val)]`. Since `val ^ val` is 0 (any number XORed with itself is 0), the initial value of `t` is `[2 ^ 0]`, which is `[2]`. After appending `ai` (which is 2) to `t`, `t` becomes `[2, 2]`. The values of `ai`, `i`, `op`, and `val` remain unchanged.
