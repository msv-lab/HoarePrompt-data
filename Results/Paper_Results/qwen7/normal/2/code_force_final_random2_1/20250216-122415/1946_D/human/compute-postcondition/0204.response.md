Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum count of times `op` became 0 during any iteration of the loop, `i` is 0, `u` is 0, and `v` is 0.**

Explanation: After all 30 iterations of the loop (from `i = 29` down to `i = 0`), the variable `t` remains an empty list because no elements are appended to it throughout the loop. The variable `ans` will hold the maximum value of `cnt` (which counts the number of times `op` becomes 0) encountered during any iteration of the loop. The variable `i` will be 0 after the last iteration. Since `u` is determined by `x >> i & 1`, and `i` starts from 29 and decreases to 0, `u` will be 0 after the loop ends. Similarly, `v` is determined by the sum of bits in `a` at position `i`, and since `i` reaches 0, `v` will also be 0.
