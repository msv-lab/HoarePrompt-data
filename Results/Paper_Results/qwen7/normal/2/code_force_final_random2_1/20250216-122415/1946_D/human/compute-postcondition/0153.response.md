Output State: **`ai` is `ai ^ val`, `i` is 3, `op` is `op ^ (val >> 3 & 1)`**

Explanation: The code modifies the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the result of `(val >> i & 1)`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to `(val >> 3 & 1)`, which shifts `val` right by 3 bits and then performs a bitwise AND with 1. This operation extracts the 4th bit (from the right) of `val`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
