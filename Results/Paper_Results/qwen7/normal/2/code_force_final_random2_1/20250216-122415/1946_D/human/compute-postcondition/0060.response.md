Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for val in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `val` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body Effects**:
   - `op` is updated by performing `op ^= val >> i & 1`.
   - `cnt` is increased by 1 if `op` is false.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty iterable.
   - `op` is updated by the operation `op ^= val >> i & 1`.
   - `cnt` is increased by 1 if `op` is false.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `a` is an iterable, it will continue to be the same unless it is exhausted or modified within the loop body. However, since no modification is mentioned, `a` remains the same.
   - `val` will be the next element from the iterable `a`.
   - `op` will be updated based on the current value of `val`.
   - `cnt` will be incremented by 1 if `op` is false after the update.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `a` remains the same as it is a non-empty iterable.
   - `val` becomes the next element from `a`.
   - `op` is updated by the operation `op ^= val >> i & 1`.
   - `cnt` is increased by 1 if `op` is false.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`a` is a non-empty iterable, `val` is the next element from `a`, `op` is updated by performing `op ^= val >> i & 1`, `cnt` is increased by 1 if `op` is false**.
