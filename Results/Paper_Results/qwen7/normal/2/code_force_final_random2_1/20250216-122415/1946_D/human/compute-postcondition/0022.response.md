Output State: **`op` is False, `ai` is 0, `t` is [0]**.

Explanation: The initial state is `op` is False, `ai` is `ai ^ (val >> i & 1)`, and `t` is a list containing the value of `ai`. The code snippet sets `ai` to 0. Since `ai` was previously defined as `ai ^ (val >> i & 1)`, setting `ai` to 0 means that `ai` is now 0. The list `t` contains the value of `ai`, which is now 0, so `t` is updated to be `[0]`. The value of `op` remains unchanged as False.
