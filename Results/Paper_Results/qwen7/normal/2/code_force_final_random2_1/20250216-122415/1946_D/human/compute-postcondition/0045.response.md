Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is not 0, and the current value of `v` is odd.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
