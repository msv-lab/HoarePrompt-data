Postcondition: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or the maximum of -1 and the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, `i` is 0, `u` is 0, and `v` is even.**

This means that after executing the if-else block, the list `t` remains empty, `ans` will be -1 unless `op` (the final result of the XOR operation) becomes 0 multiple times, in which case `ans` will be the maximum of -1 and the count of such occurrences. The variable `i` is reset to 0, `u` and `v` are both set to 0, and `v` is guaranteed to be even.
