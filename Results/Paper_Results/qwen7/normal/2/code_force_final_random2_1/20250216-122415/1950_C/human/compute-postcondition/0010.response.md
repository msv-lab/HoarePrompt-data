Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an input integer with the current value being (input integer - 12), `m` is an input integer, and `h` is not equal to 0.**

This means that the value of `h` has been decreased by 12, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
