Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
3. It then checks the value of `h` to determine whether to convert to 'AM' or 'PM':
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is between 1 and 11 inclusive, it sets `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is 12, it sets `day` to 'PM'.
4. The program prints the time in the correct 12-hour format with leading zeros for both hours and minutes.
5. The logic for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format is correct and covers all edge cases (e.g., 00:00, 12:00, etc.).

Based on this analysis, the program correctly converts the given times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

Correctness: **True**
