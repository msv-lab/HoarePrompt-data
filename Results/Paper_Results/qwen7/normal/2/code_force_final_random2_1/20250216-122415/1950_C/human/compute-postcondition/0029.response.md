Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `h` is the integer part of the input split by ':' decreased by 12, `m` is the integer part of the input split by ':'**.

Explanation: The code `h = h - 12` decreases the value of `h` by 12. The other variables (`t`, `day`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
