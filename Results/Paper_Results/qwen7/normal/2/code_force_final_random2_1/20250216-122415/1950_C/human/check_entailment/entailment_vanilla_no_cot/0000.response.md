Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when the hour is 00 or 12. Here's why:

1. When `h` is 00, it should be printed as `12` with `AM`, but the current logic incorrectly sets it to `12` and keeps `day` as `'AM'`.
2. When `h` is 12, it should remain `12` with `PM`, but the current logic incorrectly changes `day` to `'PM'` after setting `h` to 12.

To fix this, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle these cases. Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')


func()
```

However, a more concise and correct way would be:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        h12 = h % 12
        day = 'AM' if h < 12 else 'PM'
        if h == 0:
            h12 = 12
        print(f'{h12:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')


func()
```

This version correctly handles all edge cases and produces the expected output.
