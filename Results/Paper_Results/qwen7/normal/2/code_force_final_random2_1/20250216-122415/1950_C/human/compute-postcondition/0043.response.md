Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is the integer part of the input split by ':'**.

Explanation: The line `day = 'AM'` changes the value of the variable `day` to 'AM'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
