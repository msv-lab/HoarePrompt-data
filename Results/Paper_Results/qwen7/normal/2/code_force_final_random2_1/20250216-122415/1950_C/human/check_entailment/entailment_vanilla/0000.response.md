### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - For hours equal to 0, it correctly converts them to 12 AM.
   - For hours greater than 12, it correctly subtracts 12 to convert them to the 12-hour format and sets the period to PM.
   - For hours between 1 and 11, it correctly sets the period to AM.
   - For hour 12, it correctly sets the period to PM.
3. **Minute Handling**: The minutes are handled correctly and printed with leading zeros if necessary.
4. **Output Format**: The output is formatted as required, with the time followed by either "AM" or "PM".

### Analysis:
- The logic for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format is correct.
- The handling of edge cases such as 00:00, 12:00, and 23:59 is also correct.
- The use of f-string formatting ensures that the time is printed in the correct 12-hour format with leading zeros where necessary.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
