Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is the integer part of the input split by ':', `m` is the integer part of the input split by ':'**

Explanation: The code simply changes the value of `day` to 'PM'. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values of `t`, `n`, `h`, and `m` are still valid as per the initial state.
