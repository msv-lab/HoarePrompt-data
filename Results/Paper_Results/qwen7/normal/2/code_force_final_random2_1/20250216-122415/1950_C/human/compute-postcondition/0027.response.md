Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `h` is 12, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the integer part of the input split by ':'**

Explanation: The code `h = 12` assigns the value 12 to the variable `h`. The values of `t`, `day`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
