Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `_`: This is a throwaway variable, so its value doesn't matter for the loop to execute.
   - `n`: This is the input integer that determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop requirements**:
   - Since the loop requires `n` to be greater than 0, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`, ensuring it is greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0**
