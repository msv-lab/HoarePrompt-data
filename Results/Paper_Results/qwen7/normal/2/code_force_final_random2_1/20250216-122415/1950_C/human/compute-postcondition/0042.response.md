Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is the integer part of the input split by `:`.**

The code assigns the value 12 to the variable `h`. The other variables (`t`, `day`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
