Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, day is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is an input integer**.

The code simply reassigns the variable `day` to the string `'AM'`. Since the initial state already had `day` as `'AM'`, this assignment does not change the value of `day`. All other variables remain unchanged.
