Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is the integer part of the input split by `:`, `m` is the integer part of the input split by `:`. If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is set to 'PM' and `h` is decreased by 12. Otherwise, if `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is less than or equal to 12, `day` remains unchanged.
