Output State: `i` is 20, `idx` is 19, `n` is an input integer (unchanged), `k` is an input integer (unchanged), `nums` is a list containing elements `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over the length of the `nums` list. Since `nums` has 21 elements, the loop will run 21 times. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after 21 iterations, `i` will be 20. The condition `if nums[i] > k:` checks if the current element in `nums` is greater than `k`. If it is, then `idx` is set to `i - 1` and the loop breaks. Given the sequence of `nums`, which is a list of powers of 2, and without knowing the specific value of `k`, we can infer that the loop will continue until it finds an element in `nums` that is greater than `k`. Based on the provided output states, we know that when the loop runs 3 times, `idx` is 1, meaning the third element (index 2) is greater than `k`. Following this pattern, after 21 iterations, the last element in `nums` (which is `1048576`) will be checked. If `k` is less than `1048576`, `idx` will be set to 20 (the index of `1048576` minus 1). Thus, `idx` will be 19. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and the `nums` list itself) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
