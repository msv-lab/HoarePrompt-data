You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        i = 0
        
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        
        print(len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: Output State: `j` is 0, `i` is 31, `tc` is 2, `n` is the original input integer, `k` is 2147483648, and `ans` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288]`.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will have reached 0 (since it starts at 19 and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0). The variable `i` remains unchanged at 31. The loop counter `tc` will be 2 because the loop has completed two full iterations over the test cases. The variables `n` and `k` remain the same as their initial values since they are not affected by the loop. The list `ans` will contain 20 elements, each being `1 << j` for `j` ranging from 0 to 19, inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and two other positive integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n). For each test case, the function checks if the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7. If the condition is met, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
