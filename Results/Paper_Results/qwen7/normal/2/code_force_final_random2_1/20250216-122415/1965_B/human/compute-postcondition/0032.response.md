Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The variable `i` is already initialized to 21.
   - The variable `len(nums)` is determined by the length of the list `nums`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`.

4. **Check the given state**:
   - `idx` is -1 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop).
   - `k` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop).
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) plus \((1 << 20)\), \((1 << 21)\), and \((1 << 22)\).
   - `i` is equal to 21.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(nums)` for the loop to execute.
   - Since `i` is 21, we need to check the length of `nums` to ensure that `len(nums)` is greater than 21.

6. **Determine the length of `nums`**:
   - The list `nums` contains integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) plus three additional elements \((1 << 20)\), \((1 << 21)\), and \((1 << 22)\).
   - This means `nums` contains \(21 + 3 = 24\) elements.
   - Therefore, `len(nums)` is 24.

7. **Final adjustment**:
   - Since `i` is 21 and `len(nums)` is 24, the loop will execute because `21 < 24`.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 21, `len(nums)` must be greater than 21**
