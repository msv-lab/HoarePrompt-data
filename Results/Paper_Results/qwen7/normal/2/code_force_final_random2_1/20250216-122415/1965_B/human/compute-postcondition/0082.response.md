Output State: The loop will continue to execute for each test case provided by the user until all test cases are processed. After all iterations, `idx` will be updated to the last index where `nums[i]` exceeds `k`. The list `nums` will contain specific elements based on the value of `k` for each test case. Specifically, `nums` will include all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), along with additional elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, and will exclude the element `1 << idx`. The length of `nums` will be printed for each test case, and the final output will consist of these lengths and the corresponding lists of `nums` for each test case.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and the sequence of test cases are not specified, the final state of `nums` will vary based on the inputs. However, the structure of `nums` will always follow the pattern described above for each test case.
