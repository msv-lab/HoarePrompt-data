Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 21.
   - The postcondition states that if `nums[21]` is greater than `k`, then `idx` is set to 20 and the loop is broken out. Otherwise, no changes are made to `idx`.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(nums)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 21, the next value of `i` would be 22.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(nums)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented to 22.
   - `len(nums)` remains unchanged as it is a property of the list and does not change within the loop.

5. **Consider the postcondition**:
   - The postcondition does not affect the loop continuation directly but modifies `idx` based on the value of `nums[21]`.
   - However, since we are only asked to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we do not need to consider the effect on `idx` for this step.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 22, `len(nums)` must be greater than 22**
