Output State: `idx` is 2, `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), and `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, which is 21, because the loop has completed all its iterations without breaking, and thus `idx` is set to the last index where `nums[i]` was checked against `k`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `idx` will be 2, meaning the loop found the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k` at index 2 (since indexing starts at 0). The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `i`) retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop, with `i` being set to 21, indicating the loop has completed all 21 iterations.
