Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).
3. It then finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and uses this value to construct the sequence `nums`.
4. The sequence `nums` is constructed to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`, but every integer from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.
5. The sequence includes:
   - All powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).
   - `k - nums[idx]` to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to cover additional sums.
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1` to ensure the sequence size is at most 25.
6. The program removes one of the powers of 2 to ensure the sequence size is exactly 25.
7. The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
