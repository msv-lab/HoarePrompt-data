Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with an additional element `k - nums[2]` and `k + 1` appended to it, and `i` is equal to 21.**

Explanation: The code `nums.append(k + 1)` appends the value `k + 1` to the list `nums`. The initial state of `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with an additional element `k - nums[2]` appended to it. After appending `k + 1`, the list `nums` now contains integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), the element `k - nums[2]`, and the new element `k + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
