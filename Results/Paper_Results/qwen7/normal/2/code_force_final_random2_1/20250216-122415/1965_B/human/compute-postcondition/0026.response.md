Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `idx` is 2.
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` and `k` are input integers (though their specific values are not needed for this particular print statement).
   - `nums` is a list initially containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). This means `nums` contains the integers from 1 to 1048576 (since \(2^{20} = 1048576\)).
   - Elements `k - nums[2]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[2] + 1` are appended to `nums`.
   - `i` is set to 21.
   - After appending the new elements, `nums` does not contain the element `1 << idx` (which is 4).

2. **List `nums` Construction:**
   - Initially, `nums` contains the integers from 1 to 1048576.
   - `nums[2]` is the third element in the list, which is 3.
   - Therefore, the elements appended to `nums` are:
     - `k - nums[2] = k - 3`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + nums[2] + 1 = k + 3 + 1 = k + 4`

3. **Final State of `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` now contains all integers from 1 to 1048576 plus the three additional elements `k - 3`, `k + 1`, and `k + 4`.
   - Since `1 << idx` (which is 4) is not in `nums`, it confirms that 4 was not part of the original list or the appended elements.

4. **Length of `nums`:**
   - The original list had 1048576 elements.
   - Three additional elements were appended.
   - Therefore, the total number of elements in `nums` is \(1048576 + 3 = 1048579\).

Given this analysis, the length of `nums` is 1048579.

Output: **1048579**
