Output State: **`i` is 1, `idx` is 0, `n` is an input integer (unchanged), `k` is an input integer (unchanged), `nums` is a list containing elements `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`**.

Explanation: The code `idx = i - 1` updates the value of `idx` to be `i - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `idx` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
