Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^20.**

The code creates a list `nums` using a list comprehension. It initializes each element of `nums` as `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 20. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
