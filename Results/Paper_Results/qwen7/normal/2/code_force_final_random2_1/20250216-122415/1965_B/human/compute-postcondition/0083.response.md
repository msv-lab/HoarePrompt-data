Output State: The loop will execute for each test case provided by the user. After all iterations, `idx` will be set to the index where `2^idx` is just greater than `k` for the last test case processed. The `nums` list will contain specific elements derived from `k` and the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. Specifically, `nums` will include `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 1048577, k + nums[idx] + 1]` for the last test case. The length of `nums` will be printed for each test case, and the final list `nums` will be printed out after all test cases have been processed. The variable `t` will remain unchanged as it was in the initial state, and `n` and `k` will retain their values from the last test case processed.
