The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a list of specific numbers derived from \( k \) and the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \). It then prints the length of this list followed by the list itself. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final state of the list and its length. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints a list for each test case.
