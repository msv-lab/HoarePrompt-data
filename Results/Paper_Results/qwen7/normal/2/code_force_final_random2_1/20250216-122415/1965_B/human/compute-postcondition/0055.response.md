Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 23
- `idx` is 21
- `nums` contains an element equal to `k + nums[idx]`.

The `print(*nums)` statement will print the elements of the `nums` list. Since only one specific condition about `nums` is given (`nums` contains an element equal to `k + nums[idx]`), we cannot determine the exact contents of `nums` without knowing the value of `k`. However, we know that there is at least one element in `nums` that satisfies this condition.

Given the information, the output will be the elements of the `nums` list, with at least one element being `k + nums[idx]`.

Output: **[element1, element2, ..., k + nums[idx], ...] (where at least one element in the list is k + nums[idx])**
