Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are the input value from `int(input())` and the loop counter, which is implicitly used but not named.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as the input value is a positive integer. The loop counter starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 23
   - `idx` is 21
   - `nums` contains an element equal to `k + nums[idx]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop counter (which is the input value) must be a positive integer for the loop to continue.
   - Since the loop counter is derived from `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input value is a positive integer.
   - After the previous iteration, the loop counter was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, the input value must be at least 24 (since it was 23 before).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 23 because it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `idx` remains unchanged at 21 because it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `nums` remains unchanged because it is not directly modified by the loop.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated loop counter condition.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 23, `idx` is 21, `nums` contains an element equal to `k + nums[idx]`, and the input value must be at least 24**
