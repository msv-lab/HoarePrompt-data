Output State: **`i` is 23, `idx` is 21, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `i` and `idx` remain unchanged. The precondition that `input value must be at least 24` is now applicable to `n`, meaning `n` is at least 24.
