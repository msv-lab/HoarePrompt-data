Output State: **`i` is 20, `idx` is 19, `n` is an input integer (unchanged), `k` is an input integer (unchanged), `nums` is a list containing elements `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k-512]`**.

Explanation: After the loop, `i` is 20 and `idx` is 19. The `nums` list remains unchanged except for the last element, which is updated to `k - nums[idx]`. Since `idx` is 19, the last element of `nums` is `nums[19]`, which is 512. Therefore, the new last element of `nums` is `k - 512`.
