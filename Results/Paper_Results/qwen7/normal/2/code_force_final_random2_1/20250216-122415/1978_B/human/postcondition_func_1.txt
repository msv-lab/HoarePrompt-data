The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` represents the number of buns, `a` represents the usual price of a bun, and `b` represents the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. It performs a binary search to find the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price in order to maximize profit. The function returns the highest profit obtained during this process.
