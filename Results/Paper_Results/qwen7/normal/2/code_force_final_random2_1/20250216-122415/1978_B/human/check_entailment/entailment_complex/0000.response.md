Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the maximum profit Bob can make by selling all buns under the given promotional rules. The profit is maximized by choosing the optimal number of buns (`k`) to sell at the modified price.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula: \( k \times b - k \times (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) \times a \).
   - The term \( k \times b - k \times (k - 1) // 2 \) calculates the total cost for the first `k` buns with the modified prices.
   - The term \( (n - k) \times a \) calculates the total cost for the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The binary search iteratively narrows down the range of possible `k` values from `0` to `min(n, b)`.
   - For each midpoint `mid` in the current range, it calculates the profit for both `mid` and `mid + 1` and updates the maximum profit accordingly.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found within the specified range.

4. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search correctly updates the range based on whether the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`.
   - This ensures that the search converges to the optimal `k`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `k = 0` (selling all buns at the usual price) and when `k = min(n, b)` (selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price).

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by selling the buns under the given promotional rules. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
