Output State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and `profit_mid`; `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns; `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun; `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)` updates `max_profit` to be the maximum value between its current value (which is 0) and `profit_mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
