Output State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and `profit_mid`; `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns; `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun; `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price; `low` is `mid` + 1; `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`; `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.**

Explanation: The variable `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values and relationships. Specifically, `low` is now `mid` + 1, while `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` remain unchanged from their previous states.
