Output State: The final value of `max_profit` is the highest profit obtained during any iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `low` will be exactly one more than `high`, indicating that the binary search has completed. The variable `mid` will hold the last midpoint value considered in the search, and `profit_mid` and `profit_next` will be the profits calculated for `mid` and `mid + 1` respectively in the last iteration. However, since the loop condition `low <= high` ensures that the search continues until `low` exceeds `high`, the exact values of `profit_mid` and `profit_next` in the last iteration are not specified but are used to update `max_profit`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `max_profit` will contain the highest profit found throughout the entire binary search process, and the search range will no longer satisfy the condition `low <= high`.
