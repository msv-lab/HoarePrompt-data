Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_profit` is 0, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.
Code of the loop:
while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
    profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
    max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
    if profit_next > profit_mid:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and the profit calculated from the binary search process. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, the search range is adjusted to the upper half, otherwise it is adjusted to the lower half.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; if `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `mid` + 1, and `high` remains unchanged; otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid` - 1, and `low` remains unchanged; `profit_mid` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
