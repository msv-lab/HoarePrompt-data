Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules.
- The key logic is implemented in `func_2`, which uses binary search to find the optimal number of buns (`k`) to sell at the modified price.
- `func_1` calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula \( k \times b - k \times (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) \times a \), which correctly accounts for the modified price for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining buns.
- The binary search in `func_2` iteratively narrows down the optimal `k` by comparing profits for `mid` and `mid + 1`, ensuring the maximum profit is found.
- Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summaries, both functions work together to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
