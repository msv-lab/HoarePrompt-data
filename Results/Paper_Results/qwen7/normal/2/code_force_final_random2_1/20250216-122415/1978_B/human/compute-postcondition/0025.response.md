Output State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `profit_next` using the function `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. The values of `max_profit`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `profit_mid` remain unchanged from their previous states. The new value of `profit_next` is computed but not assigned to any variable that affects the initial conditions, so it is included in the output state.
