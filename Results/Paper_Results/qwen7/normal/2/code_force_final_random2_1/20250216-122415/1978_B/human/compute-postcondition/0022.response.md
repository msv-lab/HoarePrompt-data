The loop condition is `low <= high`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low <= high` must still hold true. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition `low <= high`. Since the loop updates either `low` or `high` based on the comparison between `profit_next` and `profit_mid`, we need to ensure that the updated values of `low` and `high` still satisfy the condition.

Given the conditions:
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.
- `low` is updated to `mid + 1` if `profit_next > profit_mid`.
- `high` is updated to `mid - 1` if `profit_next <= profit_mid`.

We need to ensure that the updated values of `low` and `high` still satisfy `low <= high`.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:
1. If `profit_next > profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. For the loop to continue, `mid + 1` must be less than or equal to `high`. This means `high` must be greater than or equal to `mid + 1`.
2. If `profit_next <= profit_mid`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. For the loop to continue, `low` must be less than or equal to `mid - 1`.

In both cases, the condition `low <= high` must still hold true.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Since the loop head only involves `low` and `high`, no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)` and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
