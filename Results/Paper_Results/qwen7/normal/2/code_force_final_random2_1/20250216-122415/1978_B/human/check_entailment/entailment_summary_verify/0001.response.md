### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step based on the provided problem description, the program code, and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to maximize the profit from selling `n` buns.
- The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins each.
- The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
- We need to find the value of `k` that maximizes the total profit.

#### Function `func_1` Recap
- This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
- Formula: 
  \[
  \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
  \]
- This formula correctly sums up the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining buns.

#### Function `func_2` Recap
- This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
- It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of `n` and `b`.
- It iteratively narrows down the range of `k` using binary search.
- For each `mid`, it calculates the profit using `func_1` and compares it with the profit for `mid + 1`.
- It updates `max_profit` with the higher of the two profits and adjusts the search range accordingly.

#### Binary Search Logic
- The logic in `func_2` is correct. It uses binary search to efficiently find the optimal `k`.
- The condition `if profit_next > profit_mid:` ensures that we move towards the higher profit region.
- The condition `else:` ensures that we move towards the lower profit region.

#### Verification
1. **Base Cases:**
   - If `k = 0`, the profit is simply `n * a`.
   - If `k = n`, the profit is the sum of the arithmetic series from `b` to `1`.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search implementation is correct and efficient.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring that the optimal `k` is found.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates the profit for any given `k`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The binary search in `func_2` efficiently finds the optimal `k`, and the `func_1` function accurately calculates the profit for any `k`.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
