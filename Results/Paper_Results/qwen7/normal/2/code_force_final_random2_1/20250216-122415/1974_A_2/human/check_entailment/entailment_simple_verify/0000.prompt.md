You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be the final value it takes after processing all the inputs provided by the user within the range specified by `n`. The value of `t` will be updated based on the conditions given in each iteration of the loop. Specifically, `t` starts as `b` and is modified according to the following rules:
    #- If `t` is even, it is halved (`t = t // 2`).
    #- If `t` is odd, it is halved and incremented by one (`t = t // 2 + 1`).
    #- After modifying `t`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
    #- If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains unchanged.
    #- If `t1 < a`, `t` is updated based on the value of `t2 = a - t1`:
    #  - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`.
    #  - Otherwise, `t` is increased by `(t2 // 15) + 1`.
    #
    #The final value of `t` will reflect these operations applied sequentially for each input pair `(a, b)` provided within the loop's range `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Let's analyze a few test cases to illustrate this:

1. **Test Case: \(x = 12, y = 4\)**
   - According to the problem, we need to place 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2.
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so 4 icons occupy 16 cells.
   - The grid size is 5x3, which means each screen has 15 cells.
   - To fit 16 cells from the 2x2 icons, we need at least 2 screens (since 1 screen can hold up to 15 cells, and 2 screens can hold 30 cells, which is more than enough for 16 cells).

However, the program calculates the number of screens as follows:
- It first calculates `t = b` (where `b` is the number of 2x2 icons), and adjusts `t` based on whether `b` is even or odd.
- It then calculates `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`, which seems to be an attempt to account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
- Finally, it checks if `t1 >= a` and adjusts the number of screens accordingly.

This logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the placement of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. For instance, in the case of \(x = 12, y = 4\), the program might incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate how many full screens can be filled with 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Determine how many additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.

A correct approach would involve calculating the total number of cells needed for both types of icons and then dividing by the number of cells per screen (15) to get the minimum number of screens required.
