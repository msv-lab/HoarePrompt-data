You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b
        
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be the final value it takes after processing all the inputs provided by the user within the range specified by `n`. The value of `t` will be updated based on the conditions given in each iteration of the loop. Specifically, `t` starts as `b` and is modified according to the following rules:
    #- If `t` is even, it is halved (`t = t // 2`).
    #- If `t` is odd, it is halved and incremented by one (`t = t // 2 + 1`).
    #- After modifying `t`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
    #- If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains unchanged.
    #- If `t1 < a`, `t` is updated based on the value of `t2 = a - t1`:
    #  - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`.
    #  - Otherwise, `t` is increased by `(t2 // 15) + 1`.
    #
    #The final value of `t` will reflect these operations applied sequentially for each input pair `(a, b)` provided within the loop's range `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation and returns the results accordingly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
