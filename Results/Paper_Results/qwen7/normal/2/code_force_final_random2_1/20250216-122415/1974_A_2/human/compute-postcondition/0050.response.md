Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Changes in the Loop Body:**
   Since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider how the loop might affect the variables `i` and `n`. Typically, in such loops, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is decremented by 1.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t1` is either 0 or 30.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split.
   - `b` is the integer value of the variable `b`.
   - `t` is equal to `b`.
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, if `t2 = a - t1` and `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
   - Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` starts at 1 and will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 2.
   - `n` will be decremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `n` will become `n - 1`.

5. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `t1` remains the same because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` becomes `n - 1`.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `a` remains the same because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `b` remains the same because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `t` remains the same because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `t1` remains the same because it is not affected by the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the variable `b`, `t` is equal to `b`, and `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
