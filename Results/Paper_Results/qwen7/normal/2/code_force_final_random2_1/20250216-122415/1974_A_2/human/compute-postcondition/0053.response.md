Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2; `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split; `b` is the integer value of the second word from the input split and now an integer; `t` is equal to `b`; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts the value of `b` (which was initially the integer value of the second word from the input split) into an integer again, which does not change its value since it was already an integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
