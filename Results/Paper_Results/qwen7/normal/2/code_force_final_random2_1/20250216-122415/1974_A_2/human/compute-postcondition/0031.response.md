Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial States**:
   - `t1` is either 0 or 30.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` must be 0.
   - `a` is an integer from the first input split.
   - `b` is an integer from the second input split.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it starts at 0), so `i` will become 1.
   - `n` remains the same because the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `n`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` changes to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0.

6. **Final State**:
   - `t1` remains unchanged and is either 0 or 30.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split**.
