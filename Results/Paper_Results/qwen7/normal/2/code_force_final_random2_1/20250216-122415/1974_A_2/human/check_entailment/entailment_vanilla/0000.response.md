Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 icons and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2.
   - If `t` is odd, `t` is divided by 2 and then incremented by 1. This ensures that `t` represents the minimum number of 2x2 icons that can fit into complete 5x3 grids.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space After Placing 2x2 Icons:**
   - `t1` calculates the remaining space after placing `t` 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

4. **Checking if Remaining Space Can Fit 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), it means all 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space without needing additional screens.
   - Otherwise, calculate how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. Each screen can hold up to 15 icons (5x3 grid).

5. **Output:**
   - The final value of `t` (which includes the screens needed for both 2x2 and 1x1 icons) is printed.

### Verification Against Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - `t = 1` (since 1 is odd, `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`)
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11` (which is >= 1)
   - Output: `1` (correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `a = 7`, `b = 2`
   - `t = 2` (since 2 is even, `t = 2 // 2 = 1`)
   - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7` (which is >= 7)
   - Output: `1` (correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `a = 12`, `b = 4`
   - `t = 2` (since 4 is even, `t = 4 // 2 = 2`)
   - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22` (which is >= 12)
   - Output: `2` (correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `a = 0`, `b = 3`
   - `t = 2` (since 3 is odd, `t = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2`)
   - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18` (which is >= 0)
   - Output: `2` (correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - `a = 1`, `b = 0`
   - `t = 0` (since 0 is even, `t = 0 // 2 = 0`)
   - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0` (which is < 1)
   - `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1` (which is 1 // 15 + 1 = 1)
   - Output: `1` (correct)

### Conclusion

After verifying the logic against the provided examples, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

**Correctness: True**
