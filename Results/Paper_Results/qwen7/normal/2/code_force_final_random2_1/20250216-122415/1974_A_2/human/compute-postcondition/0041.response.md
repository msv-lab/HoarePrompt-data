Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the variable `b`, `t` is equal to `b`, and `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

Explanation: The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. It simply reassigns `t` to its current value, which is `b`. Therefore, the value of `t` remains unchanged and is still equal to `b`. All other variables remain in their initial states as no operations were performed on them.
