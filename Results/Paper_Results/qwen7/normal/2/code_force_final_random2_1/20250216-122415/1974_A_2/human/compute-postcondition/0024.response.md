Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is `(a - t1) // 15 + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `t` by adding to it the integer division of `t2` by 15 plus 1. Since `t2` is defined as `a - t1` and `t2` is not divisible by 15, the value of `t` is calculated as `(a - t1) // 15 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
