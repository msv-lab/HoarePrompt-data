Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `t1` is either 0 or 30.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` must be 0.
   - `a` is an integer from the first input split.
   - `b` is an integer from the second input split.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state based on the loop condition**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - `n` must remain the same since it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged (it must still be greater than 0).

6. **Final state**: The only variables that change are `i` and `n`. The other variables (`t1`, `a`, `b`) remain the same.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: `t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split.**
