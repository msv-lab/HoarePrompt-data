Postcondition: `t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t` is either `t2 // 15` if `t2` is divisible by 15, or `(a - t1) // 15 + 1` if `t2` is not divisible by 15.
