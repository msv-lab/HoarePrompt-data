Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = int(a)` converts the first word from the input (which was previously stored in `a`) into an integer. The other variables (`t1`, `n`, `i`, and the second word from the input split, which is stored in `b`) remain unchanged.
