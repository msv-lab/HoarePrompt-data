Postcondition: `t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the variable `b`, `t` is equal to `b`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`, and depending on the condition `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated either by adding `t2 // 15` or by adding `(t2 // 15) + 1`.
