Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the variable `b`, `t` is equal to `b`, `t` is (b // 2 + 1)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` to be half of its current value (integer division) plus one. Since `b` was previously equal to `t`, the new value of `t` is `(b // 2 + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
