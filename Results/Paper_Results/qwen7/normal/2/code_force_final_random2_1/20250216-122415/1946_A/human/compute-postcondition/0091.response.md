Output State: **`op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either `int(num2 / 2) - 1` or `int(num2 / 2)`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted again, `i` is `num`, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `a` is updated to contain integers from `case` split and filtered, `median` is reassigned to `b[ma]`**

Explanation: The line `new_median = median` simply reassigns the value of `median` to `new_median`. Since `median` was previously defined as `b[ma] + 1`, `new_median` now also equals `b[ma] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
