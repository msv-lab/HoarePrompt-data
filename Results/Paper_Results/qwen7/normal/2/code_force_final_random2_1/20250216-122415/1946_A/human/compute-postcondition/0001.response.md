Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases; `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]**.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
