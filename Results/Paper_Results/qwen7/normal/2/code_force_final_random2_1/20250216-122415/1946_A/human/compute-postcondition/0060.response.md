Output State: **`op` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, and `b[ma]` is greater than or equal to 4; `b` is explicitly sorted.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Since `b[ma]` is already defined and its value is known to be greater than or equal to 4, `new_median` now holds the same value as `b[ma]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
