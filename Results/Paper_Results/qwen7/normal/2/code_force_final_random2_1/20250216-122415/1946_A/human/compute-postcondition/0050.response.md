Output State: **`op` is 0, `ma` is (`num2` // 2) - 1, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(`num2` // 2) - 1` to `ma`. The other variables (`op`, `a`, `b`, and `new_median`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
