Output State: **`op` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 4`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, and `b[ma]` is greater than or equal to 4.**

Explanation: The code `op += 1` increments the value of `op` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `op` is now 1, while `a`, `b`, `ma`, `new_median`, `median`, and `b[ma]` retain their original values and conditions.
