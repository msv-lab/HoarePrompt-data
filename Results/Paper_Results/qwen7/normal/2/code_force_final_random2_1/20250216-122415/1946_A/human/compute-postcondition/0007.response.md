Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the count of the element `a[p]` in the list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `res = a.count(a[p])` counts how many times the element at index `p` (which is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`) appears in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
