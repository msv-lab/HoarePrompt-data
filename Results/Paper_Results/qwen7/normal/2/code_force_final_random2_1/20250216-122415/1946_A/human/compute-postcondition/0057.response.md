Output State: **`op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 4`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, and `b[ma]` is greater than or equal to 4.**

Explanation: The code increments `b[ma]` by 1. Since `b[ma]` was initially equal to `median`, which is `b[ma]`, after incrementing, `b[ma]` becomes `median + 1`. Consequently, `new_median` changes from `b[ma] + 3` to `b[ma] + 4`. The other variables remain unchanged.
