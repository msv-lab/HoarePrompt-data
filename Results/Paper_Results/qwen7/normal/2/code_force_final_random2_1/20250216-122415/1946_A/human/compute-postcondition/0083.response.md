Output State: **`op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted, `i` is `num`, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
