You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the array a contains n integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9 inclusive. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is `num`, `num` is the input integer, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string from the user, `op` is 3 * `num`, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3 * `num`, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, and `new_median` is `b[ma]`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will equal `num` because the loop runs from 0 to `num-1`. The variable `op` will accumulate the value 3 for each iteration, resulting in `op` being 3 times the number of iterations, which is `3 * num`. The lists `a` and `b` will be updated according to the operations performed within the loop, with each element in `b` increased by 3 for each iteration. The variable `ma` will be recalculated based on the final value of `num2`, and `new_median` will be the value at the recalculated `ma` index in the sorted list `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (a positive integer), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and an array `a` containing `n` integers (each in the range 1 to 10^9 inclusive). The function returns a result based on the sum of all elements in array `a` across all test cases, ensuring the total sum does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
