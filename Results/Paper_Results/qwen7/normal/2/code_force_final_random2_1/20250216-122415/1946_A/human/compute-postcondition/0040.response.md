Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(0, num)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer (not modified in the loop).
   - `i` is 0 (at the start of the first iteration).
   - `num` is an input integer.
   - `num2` is an input integer.
   - `case` is the input string from the user (not modified in the loop).
   - `op` is 3 (not modified in the loop).
   - `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string (not modified in the loop).
   - `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3 (not modified in the loop).
   - `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2 (not modified in the loop).
   - `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3` (not modified in the loop).

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` starts at 0 and will be incremented by 1 at the beginning of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - `num` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range in the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` will be 1.
- `num` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `num` is an input integer, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string from the user, `op` is 3, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, and `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`.**
