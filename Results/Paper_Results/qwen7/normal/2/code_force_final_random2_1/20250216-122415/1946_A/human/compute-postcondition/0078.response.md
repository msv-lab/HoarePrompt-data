Output State: **`op` is 3, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted, `i` is `num`, `num2` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `num2 = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `num2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
