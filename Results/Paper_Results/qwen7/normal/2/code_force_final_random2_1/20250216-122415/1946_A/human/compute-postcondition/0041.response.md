Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, num)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `num`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer (unchanged).
   - `i` is 0 (at the start of the first iteration, it will become 1 after the first iteration).
   - `num` is an input integer (unchanged).
   - `num2` is an input integer (unchanged).
   - `case` is the input string from the user (unchanged).
   - `op` is 3 (unchanged).
   - `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string (unchanged).
   - `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3 (unchanged).
   - `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2 (unchanged).
   - `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3` (unchanged).

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `num` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `num`.

**State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `num` is an input integer, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string from the user, `op` is 3, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, and `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`**.
