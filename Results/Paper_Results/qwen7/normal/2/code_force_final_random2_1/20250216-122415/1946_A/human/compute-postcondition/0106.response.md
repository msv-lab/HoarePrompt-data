Output State: **`b` is sorted, `ma` is the index of `b` increased by 1, `op` is increased by 1, `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]`**.

This means that the variable `new_median` is assigned the value of `b[ma]`, where `ma` is the index of the list `b` increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
