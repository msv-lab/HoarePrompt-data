Output State: **`op` is 3, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 4`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted again (which does not change its order).**

Explanation: The line `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b` again, but since `b` was already sorted before this line, sorting it again does not change its order. All other variables remain unchanged.
