Based on the initial state provided:

- `op` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string.
- `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3.
- `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2.
- `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`.
- `case` is now the input string from the user.

The `print(1)` statement will simply print the integer 1.

Output: **1**
