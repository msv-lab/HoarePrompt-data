Output State: **`op` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 2`, `median` is `b[ma] + 2`, `b[ma]` is now greater than or equal to 5; `b` is explicitly sorted.**

Explanation: The code `b[ma] += 1` increments the value of `b[ma]` by 1. Since `b[ma]` was initially greater than or equal to 4, after the increment, it becomes greater than or equal to 5. The other variables remain unchanged. The new median (`new_median`) and `median` are updated to reflect the new value of `b[ma]`.
