`op` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `a`, `b`, `ma`, `new_median`, and `median` remain unchanged because the code only modifies `op`. The precondition that `b` is explicitly sorted and sorted again (which does not change its order) remains valid.

Output State: **`op` is 3, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 4`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted, `b` is sorted again which does not change its order.**
