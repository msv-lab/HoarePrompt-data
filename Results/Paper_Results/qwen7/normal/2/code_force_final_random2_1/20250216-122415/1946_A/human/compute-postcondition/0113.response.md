Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (a positive integer), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and an array `a` containing `n` integers (each in the range 1 to 10^9 inclusive). The function returns a result based on the sum of all elements in array `a` across all test cases, ensuring the total sum does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each involving a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and an array `a` of integers. For each test case, it sums the elements of array `a`. The function ensures that the sum of all such sums across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5 and returns a result based on this cumulative sum.
