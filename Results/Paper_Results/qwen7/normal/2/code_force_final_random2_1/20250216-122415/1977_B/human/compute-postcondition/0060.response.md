Postcondition: `flag` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is either '0' or '1', and either the character at index `i+2` is not '1' or `s[i+2]` does not exist. If `flag` is 0 and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then no changes are made. If `flag` is 1 and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', then no changes are made as well.
