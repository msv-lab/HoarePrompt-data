Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` and less than 30, `s` is a list containing '1' appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since `i` is initially `i + 1` and less than 30, its value remains unchanged. The list `s` now contains all its previous elements plus the new element `'1'`.
