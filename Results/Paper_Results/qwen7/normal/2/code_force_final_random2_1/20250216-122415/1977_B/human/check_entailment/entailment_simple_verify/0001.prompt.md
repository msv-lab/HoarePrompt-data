You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11

Output

    1

    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning it has run 29 times since the length of the list `s` is 30 and the loop runs from `i=0` to `i=29`. After all iterations, the variable `flag` remains 0, indicating no carry-over conditions were met that would add an extra element to the list `s`.
    #
    #The list `s` contains 30 elements, where each element is determined by the binary representation of the initial input `x`. Specifically:
    #- `s[j]` is '1' if the j-th bit of `x` is 1.
    #- `s[j]` is '-1' if the j-th bit of `x` is 1 and the (j-1)-th bit is also 1.
    #- `s[j]` is '0' otherwise.
    #
    #The last element `s[29]` is '1' if the 29th bit of `x` is 1, and '0' otherwise. The variable `length` is fixed at 30 since no additional elements were added during the loop execution.
    #
    #The variable `t` retains its initial value, which is the number of times the outer loop ran (in this case, `t` is equal to the number of inputs processed, but since we are considering the final state after all iterations, `t` is not directly relevant to the final state of `s` and `length`). The variable `x` is no longer referenced in the final state, having been processed completely.
    #
    #In summary, the final state of the program after all iterations is characterized by a list `s` of length 30, where each element reflects the binary conditions described, and the `length` variable is set to 30.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program constructs a binary representation of `x` using a list `s`.
   - It iterates over bits from 0 to 29 (since \(2^{30}\) is the upper limit).
   - If the bit at position `i` is set (i.e., `x & (2^i)`), it appends `'1'` to `s`; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints:**
   - The program then adjusts the binary representation to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements.
   - It uses a flag to track whether a change has been made in the previous iteration.
   - If a `1` is found followed by another `1`, it changes one of them to `-1` and sets the flag.
   - If a `1` is found followed by a `0` and the flag is set, it changes the `1` to `0`.
   - Special handling is done for the last bit if necessary.

4. **Output:**
   - The length of the adjusted array is printed.
   - The array `s` is printed, with each element converted to an integer for clarity.

### Verification:

1. **Binary Representation:**
   - The initial construction of the binary representation is correct and ensures that the sum matches `x`.

2. **Constraint Handling:**
   - The logic to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements is correct. It handles transitions between `1` and `0` appropriately and ensures the final array meets the constraints.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The special handling for the last bit and the flag management ensures that the constraints are met even in edge cases like when the entire binary representation is `1`s.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the required logic to generate an array that satisfies the given constraints and matches the input integer `x`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
