You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning it has run 29 times since the length of the list `s` is 30 and the loop runs from `i=0` to `i=29`. After all iterations, the variable `flag` remains 0, indicating no carry-over conditions were met that would add an extra element to the list `s`.
    #
    #The list `s` contains 30 elements, where each element is determined by the binary representation of the initial input `x`. Specifically:
    #- `s[j]` is '1' if the j-th bit of `x` is 1.
    #- `s[j]` is '-1' if the j-th bit of `x` is 1 and the (j-1)-th bit is also 1.
    #- `s[j]` is '0' otherwise.
    #
    #The last element `s[29]` is '1' if the 29th bit of `x` is 1, and '0' otherwise. The variable `length` is fixed at 30 since no additional elements were added during the loop execution.
    #
    #The variable `t` retains its initial value, which is the number of times the outer loop ran (in this case, `t` is equal to the number of inputs processed, but since we are considering the final state after all iterations, `t` is not directly relevant to the final state of `s` and `length`). The variable `x` is no longer referenced in the final state, having been processed completely.
    #
    #In summary, the final state of the program after all iterations is characterized by a list `s` of length 30, where each element reflects the binary conditions described, and the `length` variable is set to 30.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate a valid array according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that there does not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). This constraint is violated in certain cases.

For example, consider the input \(x = 14\):

- The program generates the array \([0, -1, 0, 0, 1]\), which is correct.
- However, for \(x = 28\), the program generates the array \([0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1]\).

This array is not valid because it contains consecutive non-zero elements (\(0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1\)), violating the condition that no two consecutive non-zero elements are allowed.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that after setting \(a_i\) to \(-1\) or \(1\), it checks and adjusts subsequent elements to avoid having two consecutive non-zero elements.
