Output State: **`i` is 28, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements where for each index `j` from 0 to 28, if the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is set to 1, then `s[j]` is either '1' or '-1'; otherwise, `s[j]` is '0', and `s[29]` is '0', and `s[30]` is '1'**.

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the end of the list `s`. Since `s` originally had 30 elements, after appending `'1'`, it now has 31 elements. The first 30 elements remain unchanged according to the initial conditions. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element `'1'` at index 30.
