Output State: **`i` must be less than 30; `x` is such that when bitwise AND operation is performed with 2^`i`, the result is non-zero; `s` is a list containing '1'.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since the initial state does not provide the exact value of `i` or `x`, we keep the conditions related to them unchanged. The only new information is that `s` now contains the element `'1'`.
