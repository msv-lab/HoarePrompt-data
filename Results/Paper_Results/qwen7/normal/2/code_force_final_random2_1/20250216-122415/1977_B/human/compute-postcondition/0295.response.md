Output State: The loop will have executed 29 times, as the input `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the loop runs exactly `t` times. After all iterations, the variable `length` will be 30, as it starts at 30 and no additional elements are appended to `s` beyond the initial 30. The variable `flag` will be 0, as it is reset to 0 at the start of each outer loop iteration and never set to 1 after the second iteration. The variable `i` will be 29, indicating the last iteration of the inner loop. The list `s` will contain 30 elements, where each element is either '1', '-1', or '0'. These values are determined by the binary representation of the integer `x` provided at the beginning of each loop iteration. Specifically, `s[j]` for each index `j` from 0 to 28 will be '1' if the j-th bit of `x` is 1, '-1' if the j-th bit is 1 and the previous bit (j-1) was '1', and '0' otherwise. The last element `s[29]` will be '1' if the 29th bit of `x` is 1, and '0' otherwise.

The output of the loop will consist of the final value of `length` (which is 30) followed by the final state of the list `s`, printed as space-separated strings.
