Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is 29, `s[1]` is '0'**

Explanation: The code snippet `s[i] = '0'` changes the value of `s[1]` from '1' to '0' because initially, `s[1]` is '1' and `i` is 2. Since the condition `flag and s[i] == '0'` was not met (as `s[i]` was '1' before the change), `flag` remains 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
