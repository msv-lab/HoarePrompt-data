Postcondition: `flag` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is either '0' or '1', and either the character at index `i+2` is not '1' or `s[i+2]` does not exist. If `flag` is 0 and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then the character at index `i` is set to '1'. Otherwise, the character at index `i` remains unchanged.
