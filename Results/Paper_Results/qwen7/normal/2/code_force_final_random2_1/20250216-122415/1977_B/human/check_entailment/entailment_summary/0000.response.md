Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it constructs a list `s` of length 30 based on the binary representation of \( x \). This part is correct because it uses bitwise operations to determine the binary digits.
3. The program then iterates over the list `s` and applies specific rules to modify the elements:
   - If a '1' is found, it sets the corresponding bit in the list.
   - It checks for consecutive '1's and replaces them with '-1' and '0' respectively.
   - It ensures no two non-zero consecutive elements exist.
4. After modifications, the program adjusts the length of the list and prints the final length and the list.
5. The logic for modifying the list seems to ensure that no two non-zero consecutive elements exist, which aligns with the problem constraints.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program appears to meet the requirements and constraints specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
