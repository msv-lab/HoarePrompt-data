Postcondition: **`i` is 28, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements where for each index `j` from 0 to 28, if the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is set to 1, then `s[j]` is either '1' or '-1'; otherwise, `s[j]` is '0', and `s[29]` is '0' or '1' depending on the value of `x` at the 29th position in its binary representation; `length` is 1.**
