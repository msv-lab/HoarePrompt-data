Output State: **`flag` is 0; the character at index `i` of string `s` is '-1'; the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is '1'.**

The code changes the character at index `i` of string `s` from '1' to '-1'. The value of `flag` remains unchanged, and the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is still '1'.
