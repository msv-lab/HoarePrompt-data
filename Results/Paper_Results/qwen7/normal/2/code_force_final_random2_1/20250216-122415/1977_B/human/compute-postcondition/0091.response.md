Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `length` must be greater than 1
   - `s[2]` remains '0'
   - If `s[1]` is '-1', then `s[i-1]` remains '1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the string `s`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, length)`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `length-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `length`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will execute again if `length` is greater than 2.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - `length` must still be greater than 1 (and now it must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue).
   - `s[2]` remains '0' (no change needed as it was already set in the previous iteration).
   - If `s[1]` is '-1', then `s[i-1]` (which is `s[2]`) remains '1'. Since `s[2]` is already '0', this condition does not affect the current state.

6. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `length` must be greater than 2.
   - `s[2]` remains '0'.
   - The condition `s[1]` is '-1' does not change the state since `s[2]` is '0'.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 3, `length` must be greater than 2, `s[2]` remains '0'**.
