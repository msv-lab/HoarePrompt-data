Output State: **`nalla` is 0, `t` is the value of `int(input())`, `x` is the value of `int(input())`, `s` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `s`. The values of `nalla`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `nalla` is still 0, `t` retains its value as the integer input from the first input prompt, and `x` retains its value as the integer input from the second input prompt. The list `s` is now an empty list.
