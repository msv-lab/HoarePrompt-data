Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all 30 iterations, `i` will be 29, `x` will still be an integer, and `s` will be a list of 30 elements. Each element in `s` will be '1' if the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is set to 1, and '0' otherwise; `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements. If `flag` is 0, the first element of `s` is '1' and the second element is '1', and the third element is '-1'. If `flag` is 1, the first element of `s` is '0'. Otherwise, the first two elements of `s` are both '1' and `flag` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements. If `flag` is 1, the first element of `s` will be set to '-1' if `s[1]` equals `s[2]` and both are '1'. Otherwise, the first element of `s` will remain '0'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[1]` is '0', the first element of `s` will remain '1'. Otherwise, the first two elements of `s` will both be '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements. If `flag` is 0 and the 3rd element (index 2) of `s` is '1', the 3rd element of `s` is changed to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, the 3rd element of `s` is changed to '0'. If `flag` is neither 0 nor 1, the 3rd element of `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
