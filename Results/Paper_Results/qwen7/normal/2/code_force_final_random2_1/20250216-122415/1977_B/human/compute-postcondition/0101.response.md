Output State: **`s` is an empty list, `i` is `length - 1`, `length` remains unchanged, `nalla` is `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer.**

The code `s = []` initializes an empty list for `s`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `length`, `nalla`, or `x`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
