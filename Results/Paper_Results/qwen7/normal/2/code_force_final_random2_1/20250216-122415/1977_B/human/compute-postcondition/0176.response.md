Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 29, `n` is 29, `s[1]` is '0', `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1', `length` is 1**.

The code `length += 1` increments the value of `length` by 1. Since `length` was initially not defined in the given state, it is assumed to be 0 before this operation. After executing the code, `length` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
