Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 30, `n` is 29, `s[1]` is '0', `s[29]` is '1', `s[30]` is '0', the length of the string `s` is greater than 30, `nalla` is 31, `t` must be greater than 30, `x` is an input integer.**

The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `x`. No other variables are affected, and the conditions and values of the initial state remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `x` which holds the integer value of the user's input.
