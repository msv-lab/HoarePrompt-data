To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `i` is 28.
   - `length` is 30.
   - `x` is an integer whose binary representation determines the values in the list `s`.

2. **List `s`:**
   - `s` has 30 elements.
   - For each index `j` from 0 to 28, `s[j]` is determined by the j-th bit of `x`:
     - If the j-th bit of `x` is 1, then `s[j] = '1'`.
     - If the j-th bit of `x` is 1 and the (j-1)-th bit was also 1, then `s[j] = '-1'`.
     - Otherwise, `s[j] = '0'`.
   - The last element `s[29]` is '1' if the 29th bit of `x` is 1, and '0' otherwise.

3. **Binary Representation of `x`:**
   - Since `i` is 28 and `length` is 30, `x` must have 30 bits.
   - The first 28 bits of `x` determine the values of `s[0]` to `s[28]`.
   - The 29th bit of `x` determines the value of `s[29]`.

4. **Values of `s`:**
   - The first 28 bits of `x` will determine the values of `s[0]` to `s[27]` based on the given rules.
   - The 29th bit of `x` will determine the value of `s[28]` and `s[29]`.

Given the conditions, let's construct the list `s`:

- Suppose `x` is represented in binary as `b29b28...b1b0`, where `bi` is the i-th bit of `x`.
- For `j` from 0 to 27, `s[j]` will be '1' if `bj` is 1, and '0' otherwise.
- For `j` from 1 to 28, if `bj` is 1 and `bj-1` is 1, then `s[j]` will be '-1'.
- `s[28]` will be '1' if `b28` is 1, and '0' otherwise.
- `s[29]` will be '1' if `b29` is 1, and '0' otherwise.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact binary representation of `x`. However, we know the structure of `s` based on the given rules.

Therefore, the output will be a list of 30 elements, where the first 28 elements are determined by the first 28 bits of `x`, and the last two elements are determined by the 28th and 29th bits of `x`.

Output: **['1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '0']** (or any other combination based on the binary representation of `x`)
