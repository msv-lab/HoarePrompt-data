Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 4`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to either `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true, or remains unchanged if the condition is false, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `arr`, or `nums`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
