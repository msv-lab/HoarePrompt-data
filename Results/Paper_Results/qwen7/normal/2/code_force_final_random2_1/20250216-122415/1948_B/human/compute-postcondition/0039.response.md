Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `arr` is modified according to the conditions within the loop, and `ans` is `False` if any of the conditions to update `arr[i - 1]` were met during the loop's execution; otherwise, `ans` remains `True`.**

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `m`. The values of `i`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. The initial state of `i` being 1 and `ans` being `True` if no conditions to update `arr[i - 1]` were met, or `False` if any such condition was met, is preserved.
