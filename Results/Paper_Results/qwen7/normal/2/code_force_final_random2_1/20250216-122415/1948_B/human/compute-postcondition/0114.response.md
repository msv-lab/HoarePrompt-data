Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) followed by \( n \) integers. For each test case, it checks if the last digit of each number (except the first one) is less than or equal to the last digit of the previous number. If the digits form a non-decreasing sequence when reversed, it sets a flag `ans` to `True`; otherwise, it sets `ans` to `False`. Finally, it prints "YES" if `ans` is `True`, indicating the sequence meets the condition, or "NO" if `ans` is `False`.**
