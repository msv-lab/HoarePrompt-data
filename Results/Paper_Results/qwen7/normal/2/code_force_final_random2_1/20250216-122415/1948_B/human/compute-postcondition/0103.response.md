Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is `m - 2`, `arr` is a list, and `ans` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `ans`. Since the initial value of `ans` was `False`, assigning `False` to `ans` does not change its value. All other variables (`m`, `i`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
