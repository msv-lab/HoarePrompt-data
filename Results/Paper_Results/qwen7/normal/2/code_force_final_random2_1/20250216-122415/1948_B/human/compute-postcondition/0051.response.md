Postcondition: `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is the previous value of `arr[i-1]` converted to an integer and appended to the list `[arr[i]]`, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of the previous value of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.
