Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `i` is `m - 1`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `nums[0]`; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`; if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no change to the variables.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. Since `nums` was originally a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `arr[i]` was less than `arr[i - 1]`, changing `arr[i - 1]` to `nums[0]` does not affect the sorting status of `nums`. Therefore, the condition for `ans` remains the same. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged, and the value of `arr[i]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.
