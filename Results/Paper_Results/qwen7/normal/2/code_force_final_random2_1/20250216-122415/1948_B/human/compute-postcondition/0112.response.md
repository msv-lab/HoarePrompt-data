Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `m` will be 0, `i` will be -1, `arr` will be a list as it was initially, and `ans` will be `False`.**

Explanation: The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the value of the input integer provided. Given the constraints, `n` ranges from 2 to 50. After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `m` will be decremented to 0 since it starts from the value of the first input `m` and is used in the range function which decrements `m` in each iteration. The variable `i` will be `-1` because the loop iterates in reverse from `m-1` to `0`, and once the loop finishes, `i` will be set to `-1` after the last iteration. The array `arr` will retain its initial state as no further modifications are made outside the loop's body after the last iteration. Finally, `ans` will be `False` because the condition to update `arr[i - 1]` based on the sorting of digits is checked, and if any condition fails, `ans` is set to `False`, and this state persists even after the loop completes.
