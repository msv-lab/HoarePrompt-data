Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `m-1` to `0` in steps of `-1`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

3. **Determine necessary adjustments**: 
   - The variable `i` is already set to `1` in the initial state.
   - The variable `m` must be such that the loop can start and run until `i` reaches `0`.

4. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to start, `i` should be within the range defined by `m-1` to `0`. Since `i` is initially `1`, `m` must be at least `2` for the loop to start.

5. **Adjust the state**: Given the initial state where `i` is `1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `2` to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `m` being greater than or equal to `2`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1**
