Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr`, `ans` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `m`, `i`, or `nums`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged, and `ans` is set to `False`.
