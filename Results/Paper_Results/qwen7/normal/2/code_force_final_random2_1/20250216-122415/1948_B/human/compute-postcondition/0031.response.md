Postcondition: `m` is at least 1, `i` is `m - 4`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true, and remains unchanged if the condition is false. `ans` is `False`. If `nums` is not sorted, the loop breaks. If `nums` is sorted, the loop continues without any changes to `ans`, `i`, `arr[i - 1]`, or `arr[i]`.
