Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `arr` is updated such that each element (except the last one) is replaced by the most significant digit of the next element in the original array, and `ans` is False.**

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `m`. The values of `i`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `arr` is updated according to its rule (each element except the last one is replaced by the most significant digit of the next element), and `ans` remains False.
