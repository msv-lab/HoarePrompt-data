Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is `m - 2`, `arr` is a list, and `ans` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. All other variables retain their initial states.
