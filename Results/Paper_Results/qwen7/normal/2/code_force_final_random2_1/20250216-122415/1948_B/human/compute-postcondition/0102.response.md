Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is `m - 2`, `arr` is a list, and `ans` is `False`; `nums` is a list containing the integer value of the last element of `arr` followed by the last element of `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a new list `nums` which contains two elements:
  1. The integer value of the last element of `arr` (converted using `int(str(arr[i - 1]))`).
  2. The last element of `arr` itself (`arr[i]`).

The values of `m`, `i`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
