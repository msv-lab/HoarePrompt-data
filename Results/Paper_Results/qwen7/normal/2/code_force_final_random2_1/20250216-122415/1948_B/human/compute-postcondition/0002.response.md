Output State: **`m` is an input integer**.

The code `m = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which in this case means they are not defined. The only variable affected is `m`, which now holds the integer value entered by the user.
