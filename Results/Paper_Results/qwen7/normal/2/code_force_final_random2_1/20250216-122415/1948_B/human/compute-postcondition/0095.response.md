Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr`, `ans` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it was in. Since no specific loop or conditional statement is mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial states.
