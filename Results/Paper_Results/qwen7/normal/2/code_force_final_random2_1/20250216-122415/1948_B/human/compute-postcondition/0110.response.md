Output State: **Postcondition: `m` is less than or equal to 1, `i` is `m - 1`, `arr` is a list, and `ans` is `False`.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = m - 1` down to `i = 1`. After each iteration, if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, the condition checks whether the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` form a non-decreasing sequence. If they do not, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Since the loop iterates until `i` reaches `0`, if any such condition is met, `ans` will be set to `False` and the loop will terminate. Given the conditions provided, if the loop completes all its iterations without breaking, it means no such condition was met, but since the problem specifies the output state after the loop executes 3 times with `ans` being `False`, it implies that the loop must have broken due to the condition being met at some point. Therefore, after all iterations, `m` will be reduced to a value less than or equal to 1 (since the loop starts from `m - 1` and decrements), `i` will be `m - 1`, `arr` will remain unchanged, and `ans` will be `False`.
