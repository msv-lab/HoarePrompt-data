Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation. Specifically, the program checks if the current element is less than the previous element and then attempts to sort the digits of the previous element and compare them. However, this approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the array can be transformed into a sorted array through the allowed operations.

Consider the following test case:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```
- The initial array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
- The program checks if `67` is less than `45`, which is false, so it moves to the next pair.
- It then checks if `45` is less than `3`, which is true.
- The program tries to sort the digits of `3` and `45`. The digits of `3` are `[3]`, and the digits of `45` are `[4, 5]`. Since `[3]` is not greater than `[4, 5]`, the program incorrectly concludes that the array cannot be sorted and prints `NO`.

However, the array can actually be sorted by applying the operation to `45` and splitting it into `[4, 5]`, resulting in the array `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, which is sorted.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle this case and others like it, leading to incorrect results.
