Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`, and `ans` is False.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to the value of `nums[0]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `arr[i - 1]` refers to `arr[-1]`, which is the last element of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
