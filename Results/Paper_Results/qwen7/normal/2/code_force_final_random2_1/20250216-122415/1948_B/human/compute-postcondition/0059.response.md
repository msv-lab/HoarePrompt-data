Postcondition: `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr`, and `ans` is False. If `nums` is not sorted, the loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, no change is made to the variables.
