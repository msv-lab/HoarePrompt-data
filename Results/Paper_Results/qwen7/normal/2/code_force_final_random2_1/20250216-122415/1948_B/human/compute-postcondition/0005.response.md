Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as the start value of `range` (which is `m - 1`) is greater than or equal to the stop value (which is `0`). Since the step is `-1`, the loop will run from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive).

3. **Adjust the initial state**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means `m - 1` should be greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, `m` must be at least `1`.

4. **Initial values of loop variables**: Before the loop starts, `i` will start from `m - 1` and decrease by `1` each iteration until it reaches `1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `m` and `i`.

- `m` must be at least `1` for the loop to start.
- `i` will start from `m - 1` when the loop begins.

So, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`m` is at least 1, `i` is `m - 1`**.
