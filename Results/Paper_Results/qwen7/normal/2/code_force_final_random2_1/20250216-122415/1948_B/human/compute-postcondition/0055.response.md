Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `m - 1` to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means it starts at `m - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `0`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The postcondition specifies that if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i]` is the second digit of the previous value of `arr[i-1]` converted to an integer. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i]` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is decrementing `i` from `m - 1` to `0`, the next value of `i` will be `0`.
   - The value of `m` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same as the previous iteration.

5. **Check the postcondition for the next iteration**:
   - For `i = 0`, the postcondition needs to be checked. If `arr[0] < arr[-1]`, then `arr[0]` should be the second digit of `arr[-1]` converted to an integer. Otherwise, `arr[0]` remains unchanged.

Given this information, we can conclude the following:

- `m` remains the same.
- `i` changes from 1 to 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0**.
