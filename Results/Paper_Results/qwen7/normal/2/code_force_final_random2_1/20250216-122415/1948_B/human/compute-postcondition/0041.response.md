Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is `True`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = True` sets the variable `ans` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `m`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
