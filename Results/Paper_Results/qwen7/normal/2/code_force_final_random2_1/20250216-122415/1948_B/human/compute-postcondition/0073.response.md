Output State: **Postcondition: `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `arr` is updated such that each element (except the last one) is replaced by the most significant digit of the next element in the original array, and `ans` is False.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be decremented to 0 since the loop runs from `m-1` down to 1. The array `arr` will be modified such that each element (except the last one) is replaced by the most significant digit of the next element in the original array, as per the logic inside the loop. The variable `ans` is set to `False` if any condition in the loop is met, which happens in the given output states after the first two iterations. Therefore, `ans` remains `False` after the loop finishes.
