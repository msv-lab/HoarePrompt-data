Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `m-1` to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `m-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it 0. However, since `i` starts from `m-1` and goes down to 1, once `i` reaches 1, the loop will stop if `m` is exactly 2. If `m` is greater than 2, then `i` would be 0 and the loop would stop.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 0. But since `i` starts from `m-1` and goes down to 1, the loop will stop if `m` is exactly 2. Therefore, `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.
   - `m` must be greater than 2 to allow `i` to decrement from 1 to 0 and enter the next iteration.

Given this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are `m` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 0**
