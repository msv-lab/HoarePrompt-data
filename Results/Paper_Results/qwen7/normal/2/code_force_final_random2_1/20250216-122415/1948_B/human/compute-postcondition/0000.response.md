Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^3. The value of `n` is now an integer input from the user, constrained to be between 2 and 50.
