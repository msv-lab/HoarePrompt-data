Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the integer representation of the last element of `arr`, `ans` is False, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the value of `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `nums` by converting the last element of `arr` (which is now updated to the integer representation of the last element of `arr`) to an integer and appending it to the list, followed by the value of `arr[i]`. Since `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is the first element of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
