Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is the previous value of `arr[i-1]` converted to an integer and appended to the list `[arr[i]]`, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of the previous value of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is False.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
