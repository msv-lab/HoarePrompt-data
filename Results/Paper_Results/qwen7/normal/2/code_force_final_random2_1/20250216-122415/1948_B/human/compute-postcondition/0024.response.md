Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `ans` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. Since `nums` is defined as `[arr[i-1], arr[i]]`, `nums[0]` is `arr[i-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
