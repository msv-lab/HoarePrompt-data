### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's reiterate why the provided program is incorrect:

1. **Logic for Checking and Fixing the Array:**
   - The program attempts to fix the array by splitting the larger number and inserting the digits back into the array. However, this approach does not guarantee that the array will become sorted after the operation. The program only checks if the combined list of digits is sorted but does not ensure that the resulting array is sorted after the operation.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Digits:**
   - The program constructs `nums` by converting the previous element into digits and appending the current element. This does not necessarily result in a sorted array because the digits may not be placed correctly to maintain the sorted order.

3. **Break Statement:**
   - The break statement inside the loop immediately stops further checks once a violation is found, which might prematurely conclude that the array cannot be sorted.

The program does not correctly determine whether the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
