Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers created from user input, and `ans` is False.**

Explanation: The code `arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a user input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer before storing them in the list `arr`. The initial values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged, and `ans` remains False.
