Output State: **`ans` is False, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and the current state of `nums` is not sorted.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the other variables or their relationships. Therefore, the conditions and values of `m`, `i`, `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums` remain unchanged from the initial state.
