Precondition: **a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, respectively, such that 3 ≤ a, b ≤ 99 and both a and b are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, where each string contains b characters, and the entire field is a list of a such strings. The field contains goals for two teams (RG for Red goal, BG for Blue goal), players (R0-R9 for Red team, B0-B9 for Blue team), and exactly one Quaffle (.Q). The number of steps T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, and a list of actions is provided, where each action is a string describing the movement or interaction of an entity on the field.**
