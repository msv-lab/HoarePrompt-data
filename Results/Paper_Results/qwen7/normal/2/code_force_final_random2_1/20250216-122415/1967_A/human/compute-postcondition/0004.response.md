Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split by spaces to an integer, `r` is the first element of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `r`. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` will be the smallest integer in the list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
