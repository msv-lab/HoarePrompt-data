Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`).

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Consider other given states**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This value does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `k` is an integer from input. This value does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers. This value does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `r` is the first element of the list `a`. This value does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `y` is 0. This value does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `rem` is 0. This value does not affect the loop execution directly.

Based on the above analysis, the only adjustments needed are for the variables `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
