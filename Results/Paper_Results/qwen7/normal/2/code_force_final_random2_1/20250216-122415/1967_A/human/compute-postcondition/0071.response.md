Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `y` is n - 1 - i.**

Explanation: The code `k = 0` sets the variable `k` to 0. This directly updates the value of `k`. All other variables (`ii`, `n`, `rem`, `y`) remain in their previous states since they were not affected by the code.
