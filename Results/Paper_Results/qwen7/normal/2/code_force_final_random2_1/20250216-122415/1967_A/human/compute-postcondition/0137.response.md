Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + 0 // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 1 - (n - 1)`, and `k` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `r` to be the value of `a[n - 1]` plus the integer division of `k` by `n`. Given that `k` is 0, `k // n` is also 0. The value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - (n - 1)`, which simplifies to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
