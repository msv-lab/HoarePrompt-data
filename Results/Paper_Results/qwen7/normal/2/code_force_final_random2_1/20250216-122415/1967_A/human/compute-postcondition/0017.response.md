Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is either `a[0] + k // (0 + 1)` when `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is true, or `a[i + 1]` when it is false, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is updated accordingly (either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`).
