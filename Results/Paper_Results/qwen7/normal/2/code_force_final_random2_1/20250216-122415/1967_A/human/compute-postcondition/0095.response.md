Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `r` is `a[n-1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers, assigning the first input to `n` and the second to `k`. The values of `ii`, `i`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `r` is still the last element of the list `a` (`a[n-1]`), but since no list operations are performed, `r` retains its original value.
