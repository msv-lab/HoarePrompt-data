Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of cards of type i initially.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the if-else block executes, `i` is equal to `n-2`. The variable `r` is set to `a[n-1] + k // n` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is never met for any `i`, otherwise `r` is set to `a[i+1]` where the condition is first met. The variable `rem` is 0, and `y` is `2` if the loop does not break, otherwise it is `n-1-i`. The variable `k` is 0 if the loop breaks due to the condition being met, otherwise it is reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all iterations where the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of the list `a` (`a[n-1]`), `rem` is 0, `y` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `r` is the last value of `a` in the list, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 1 - (n - 1)`, and `i` is `n - 1`. If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is updated to `a[n - 1] + 0 // n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
