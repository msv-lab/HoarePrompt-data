Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `ii`, `n`, `k`, or `rem`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, these variables retain their original values from the initial state.
