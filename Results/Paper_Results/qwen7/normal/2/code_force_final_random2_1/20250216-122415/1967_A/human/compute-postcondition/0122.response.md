Postcondition: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) <= k`, or 0 if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`. `r` is `a[0] + a[1]` in both cases, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 3, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
