Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head consists of the variable `ii` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `ii` is the loop variable, and it will take values from `0` to `t-1` during the loop execution.
   - The expression `int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to `ii`.

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `ii` is less than `int(input())`.
   - Since `t` is the upper bound for the number of test cases, `int(input())` should be equal to or greater than `t` for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` is already within the specified range, so no adjustment is needed for `t`.
   - We need to ensure that `int(input())` is at least `t` so that the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `int(input())` should be at least `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, int(input()) must be at least t**
