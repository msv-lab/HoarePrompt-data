Postcondition: `i` is either 3 or 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is either `a[2]` or `a[3]` depending on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is `n - i - 2`, and `k` is adjusted to either `0` or `k - 4 * (a[3] - a[2])` if the condition is met.
