Postcondition: **`i` will be equal to `n-2`, `r` will be set to `a[n-1]` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is never met for any `i`. Otherwise, `r` will be set to `a[i+1]` where the condition is first met. The variable `rem` will be 0, as it is reset to 0 whenever the loop breaks. The variable `y` will be `n-1-i` if the loop breaks, otherwise it will be `2`. The variable `k` will be reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all iterations where the condition is not met, and will be 0 if the loop breaks due to the condition being met.**
