Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is decreased by the value `(3 + 1) * (a[4] - a[3])`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from `k`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to `(3 + 1) * (a[4] - a[3])`, which is `4 * (a[4] - a[3])`. Since `k` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it exists and is updated by this operation. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
