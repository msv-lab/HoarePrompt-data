Postcondition: `i` is either 3 or 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is either `a[2]` when `i` is 2 or `a[3]` when `i` is 3, `rem` is 0 when `i` is 2 or `k % 3` when `i` is 3, `y` is `n - 2` when `i` is 2 or `n - 3` when `i` is 3, and `k` is adjusted to either 0 or `k - 4 * (a[3] - a[2])` based on the condition in the if statement.
