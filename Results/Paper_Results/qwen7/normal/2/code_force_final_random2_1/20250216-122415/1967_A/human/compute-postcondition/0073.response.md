Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` remains unchanged, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` decreases the value of `k` by the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Since `i` is initialized to 0, the expression simplifies to `k -= (0 + 1) * (a[0 + 1] - a[0])`, which means `k` is decreased by `(a[1] - a[0])`. The other variables (`ii`, `n`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
