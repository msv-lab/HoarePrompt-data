Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 999\).
- `s` is a positive integer within this range.
- If the length of `s` is 1, `s` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `s` is rotated by one character to the left.
- `s2` is a random permutation of the characters in `s`.
- After the if-else block executes, if `s` equals `s2`, then `s2` is the string obtained by rotating `s` one character to the left. Otherwise, `s2` remains a random permutation of the characters in `s`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
