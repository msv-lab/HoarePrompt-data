Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, `s` is a new input string**.

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes a new input string and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
