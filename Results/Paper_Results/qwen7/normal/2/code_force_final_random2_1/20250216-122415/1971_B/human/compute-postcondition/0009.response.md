Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, `b` is a sorted string of `s`**.

Explanation: The code `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` sorts the string `s` alphabetically and assigns the result to `b`. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `a`. The length of set `a` remains not equal to 1.
