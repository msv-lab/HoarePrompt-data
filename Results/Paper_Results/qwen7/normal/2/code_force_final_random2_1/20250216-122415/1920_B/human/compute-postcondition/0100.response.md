Output State: **`i` is 0, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in list `a`, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers input by the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sum1` to be the sum of all elements in the list `a`. Since `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, the sum of its elements is stored in `sum1`. The value of `sums` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `x` remain as integers input by the user, and `i` remains 0.
