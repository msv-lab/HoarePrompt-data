Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object here is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: The loop will execute as long as the input value is a positive integer. Given the state before the loop starts, we know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means the input value will always be within this range, ensuring the loop can execute.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the input value, and we know that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, the state needs to reflect that the input value (which is used to determine the number of iterations) is valid.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is a positive integer, which is guaranteed by the given condition on `t`.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop can execute as expected.
