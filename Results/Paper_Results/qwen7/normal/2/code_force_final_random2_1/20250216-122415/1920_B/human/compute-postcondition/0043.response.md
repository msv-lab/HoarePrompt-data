Postcondition: `i` is `j + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list with one additional element. If `i` equals 0, the new element in `ans` is `sums - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, the new element in `ans` is `sums - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, the new element in `ans` is `sums - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1]`.
