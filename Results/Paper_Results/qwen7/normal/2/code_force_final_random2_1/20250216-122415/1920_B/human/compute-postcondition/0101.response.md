Output State: **`i` is 0, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in list `a`, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers input by the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers input by the user, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ans`. No changes are made to the values of `i`, `sum1`, `sums`, `n`, `k`, `x`, or the list `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `ans` is set to an empty list.
