Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])**.

Explanation: The code updates `sums` based on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`. Since the exact values of `i`, `x`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot simplify the expression further. However, we know that `ans` is assigned the value of `sums` after the update, which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged, and `n` is still an integer.
