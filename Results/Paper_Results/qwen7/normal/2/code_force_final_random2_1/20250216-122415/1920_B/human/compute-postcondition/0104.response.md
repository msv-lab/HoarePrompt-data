Output State: **`i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` to the variable `sums`. However, the values of `sum1` and `a[:x]` are not provided, so we express `sums` in terms of these variables. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
