Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. Since the actual input values are not provided, the variables `n`, `k`, and `x` are left as input integers. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.
