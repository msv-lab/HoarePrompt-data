Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `i` is 0
   - `k` is a non-negative integer
   - If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `ans` contains the value of `sums`
   - If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` contains the value of `sums`
   - Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` contains `[sums]`

2. **Loop Head**: The loop head is:
   ```python
   for i in range(k + 1):
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**: The loop will increment `i` from 0 to `k`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - The loop condition `i < k + 1` must hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **New State Calculation**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and will be incremented by 1, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - We need to check the conditions for updating `sums` and `ans` based on the new value of `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `k` is a non-negative integer
- `sums` is either `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` or has been updated previously
- `ans` contains the current value of `sums`

After the first iteration (where `i` becomes 1):
- `i` is now 1
- `k` remains the same
- We need to check if `i + x - 1 < n` to determine how `sums` should be updated.

Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we can only update `i` and `k` based on the loop head.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer**
