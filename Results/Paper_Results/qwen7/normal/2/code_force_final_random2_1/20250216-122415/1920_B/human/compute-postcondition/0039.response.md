Output State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is `sums`, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is defined as `sums + a[i - 1]`, the new value of `sums` is added to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
