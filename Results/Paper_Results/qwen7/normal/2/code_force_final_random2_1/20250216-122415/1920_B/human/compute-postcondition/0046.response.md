To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed in the loop:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements.
   - Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.
   - The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
   - Subsequent elements in `ans` are calculated based on the conditions provided.

2. **Loop Operations**:
   - The loop runs `k + 1` times.
   - For the first iteration (`i = 0`), the value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
   - For subsequent iterations (`i > 0`):
     - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the next element is the previous element plus `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
     - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the next element is the previous element plus `a[i - 1]`.

3. **Final Value Calculation**:
   - After `k + 1` iterations, `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration.
   - The `max(ans)` function will return the maximum value among these `k + 1` elements.

Given this information, the `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value among the `k + 1` elements stored in the list `ans`.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list of k + 1 elements, each representing the value of sums after each iteration of the loop)**
