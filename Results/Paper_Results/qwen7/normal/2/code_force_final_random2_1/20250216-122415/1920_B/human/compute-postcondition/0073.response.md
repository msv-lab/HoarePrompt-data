Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`, `ans` contains `[sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]]**.

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is defined as `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`, it means `ans` now contains the value of `sums` calculated from the initial state. All other variables (`i` and `k`) remain unchanged.
