Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes inputs through test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by arrays n, k, and x which are positive integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n), and an array a consisting of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for all i). It returns different outputs based on the conditions specified within the test cases.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a value for t, along with arrays n, k, x, and a. The function's behavior and return values are defined within the context of these test cases, but the specific return values or actions are not detailed here.
