Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated by adding `a[2]` (since `i-1` is 2), `ans` contains the final value of `sums` after the update, and `k` is greater than 2**.

This means that the value of `sums` has been updated by adding the element `a[2]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
