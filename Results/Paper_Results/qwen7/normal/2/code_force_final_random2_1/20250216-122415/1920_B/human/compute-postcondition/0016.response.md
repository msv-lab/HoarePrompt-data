Output State: **`sums` is `sums + a[0]`, `i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is initially 0, `a[i - 1]` is equivalent to `a[-1]`, which is undefined in Python unless `a` is a list with a negative index (which is not typical). However, based on the given conditions, we assume `i` is adjusted to be within the bounds of the list `a`. Since `i` is 0, `i - 1` would be -1, but since `i` is not equal to 0, we consider the next valid index, which is 0. Thus, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and the condition involving `n`) remain unchanged.
