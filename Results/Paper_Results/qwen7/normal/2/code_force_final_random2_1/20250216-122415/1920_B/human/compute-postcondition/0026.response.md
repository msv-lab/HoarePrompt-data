Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list containing `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]` if `1 + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[0]` if `1 + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`**

Explanation: 
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- The variable `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code.
- The variable `ans` is a list that gets appended with the current value of `sums`. The value of `sums` is updated according to the conditions provided, but since the exact value of `sums` is not specified, it retains its updated form.
- The variable `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, reflecting the changes made during the execution of the code.
