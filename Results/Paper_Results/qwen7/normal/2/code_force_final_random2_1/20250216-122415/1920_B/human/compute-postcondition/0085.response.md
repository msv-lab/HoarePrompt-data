Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[1]`**

Explanation: The variable `sums` is updated by adding the element `a[i-1]` to its current value. Given that `i` is 2, `i-1` equals 1, so `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
