Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated based on the following conditions: if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`. `ans` is a list containing the final value of `sums` after the update.
