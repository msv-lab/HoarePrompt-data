Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` contains either `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]` if `1 + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[0]` if `1 + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`. The value of `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, which simplifies to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[0] - 2 * a[1 + x - 1]` since `i` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
