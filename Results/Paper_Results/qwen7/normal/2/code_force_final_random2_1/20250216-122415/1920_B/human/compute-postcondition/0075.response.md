Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `a[0]`, `ans` contains `[sums]`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given that `sums` is initially `a[0]`, `ans` will now contain the element `[a[0]]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
