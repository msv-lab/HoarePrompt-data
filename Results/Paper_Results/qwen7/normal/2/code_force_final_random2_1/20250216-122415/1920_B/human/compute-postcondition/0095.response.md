Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. This means that the loop will run for as many times as the user inputs (let's call this input `k`). The loop variable `_` is used but does not affect the state directly; it just increments with each iteration.

2. **Determine the initial state**: The initial state is not explicitly given, but we know that the loop will start with some initial value of `i` (which is 0) and `sums` will be initialized based on the condition `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop will run from 0 to `k-1` (inclusive). Each iteration updates the `sums` variable based on certain conditions.

4. **Identify the state adjustments needed**: Since the loop runs based on the input `k`, the key variables to consider are `i` and `sums`. After each iteration, `i` will increment by 1, and `sums` will be updated according to the specified conditions.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `sums` will be updated based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.

Given that the loop runs for `k` iterations, let's assume we are at the start of the next iteration (the first iteration would have `i = 0`).

### Example Answer:
If we are at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 0 (since it starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration), and `sums` will be updated based on the initial condition or the previous iteration's value.

State: **`i` is 0, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**.

However, since we are asked to provide the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the state right before the loop starts running for the first time. Therefore, the correct state should reflect the initial setup:

State: **`i` is 0, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**.

This is the state at the start of the first iteration of the loop, which is effectively the state at the start of the next iteration after the previous iteration has completed.
