Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `ans` contains the value of `sums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not involved in the operation. The expression for `sums` remains the same as it is not recalculated.
