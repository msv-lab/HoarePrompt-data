Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be a non-negative integer, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` to be the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. However, the values of `sum1` and `a[:x]` are not provided, and `x` is not defined in the given information. Therefore, we cannot simplify `sums` further. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
