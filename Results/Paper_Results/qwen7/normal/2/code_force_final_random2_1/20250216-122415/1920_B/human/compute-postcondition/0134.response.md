Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated by adding `a[2]` (since `i-1` is 2), `ans` now contains `[sums]`, and `k` is greater than 2**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` was previously updated by adding `a[2]` (because `i-1` is 2), the value of `sums` is added to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
