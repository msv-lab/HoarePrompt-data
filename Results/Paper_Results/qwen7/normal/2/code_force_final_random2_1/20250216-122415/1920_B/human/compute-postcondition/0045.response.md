Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is a list `ans` containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. 

- If `i` equals 0, the first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- For subsequent iterations, if `i + x - 1 < n`, the next element in `ans` is the previous element plus `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, the next element in `ans` is the previous element plus `a[i - 1]`.

This process continues until the loop has executed `k + 1` times, resulting in a list `ans` with `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration.
