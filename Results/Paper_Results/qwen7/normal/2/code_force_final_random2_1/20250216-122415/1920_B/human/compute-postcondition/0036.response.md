Output State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to the current value of `sums`. The variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `ans`, and `sums` (with the exception of the update to `sums`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The updated value of `sums` is expressed as the original value of `sums` plus the calculated difference.
