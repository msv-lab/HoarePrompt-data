Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the `sums` variable by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value. Since `i` is initially 0, `i - 1` would be -1, which means `a[i - 1]` is not defined unless `a` is indexed from -1, but typically, array indexing starts from 0. Given the precondition, we assume `a` is zero-indexed, so `a[i - 1]` would be undefined or considered as 0 if out-of-bound access is allowed. However, since the exact value of `a[i - 1]` and `a[i + x - 1]` is not specified, we keep it in the form given. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
