Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding the element `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]` since `i` is 2) and subtracting twice the element `a[i + x - 1]` (which is `2 * a[x]`). The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and `sums` is updated according to the given expression.
