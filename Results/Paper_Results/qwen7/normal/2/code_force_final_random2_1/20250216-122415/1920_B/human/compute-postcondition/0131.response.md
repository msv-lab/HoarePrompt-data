Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated by adding `a[2]` and subtracting `2 * a[x]`, `ans` contains the final value of `sums` after the update, and `k` is greater than 2**.

Explanation: The code updates `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[2]` since `i` is 3) and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]` (which is `2 * a[x]` since `i` is 3). The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged except for `sums`, which is now updated according to the given formula.
