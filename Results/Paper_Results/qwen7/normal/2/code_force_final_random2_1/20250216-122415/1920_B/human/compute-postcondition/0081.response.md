Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` to the variable `sums`. Here, `sum1` and `a[:x]` are not defined in the given information, so they remain as they are. The value of `i` and `k` remains unchanged.
