Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is equal to `sums + a[0]`, and `ans` contains `[sums + a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is currently equal to `sums + a[0]`, `ans` will contain the value `[sums + a[0]]`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged.
