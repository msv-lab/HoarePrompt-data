Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. The array a consists of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for all i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    a.reverse()
    sum1 = sum(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k + 1):
        if i == 0:
            sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
            ans.append(sums)
        elif i + x - 1 < n:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
        else:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
    print(max(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is a list `ans` containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. 

- If `i` equals 0, the first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- For subsequent iterations, if `i + x - 1 < n`, the next element in `ans` is the previous element plus `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, the next element in `ans` is the previous element plus `a[i - 1]`.

This process continues until the loop has executed `k + 1` times, resulting in a list `ans` with `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `i` will be equal to `k`, and `k` is a non-negative integer. The variable `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, `sums` starts as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` when `i` is 0. For each subsequent iteration, `sums` is updated according to the conditions: if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. The list `ans` will contain all the values of `sums` calculated during each iteration of the loop.

In summary, `ans` will be a list of all intermediate sums calculated by the loop, starting with `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and updating based on the specified conditions until `i` reaches `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `k + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `ans` will contain the final value of `sums` after all updates.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
