Output State: **`i` is 0, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. The values of `i`, `sums`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `a` is updated with the newly input integers.
