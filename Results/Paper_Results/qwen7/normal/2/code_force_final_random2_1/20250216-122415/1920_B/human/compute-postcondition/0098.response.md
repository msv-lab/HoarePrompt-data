Output State: **`i` is 0, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers input by the user, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `i`, `sums`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` itself (before sorting) remain unchanged. The only change is that `a` is now sorted.
