Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])**.

The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, it is added to `ans` as a new element. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
