Postcondition: `count` is `x - 1`, `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, and the current value of `num` is 1.
