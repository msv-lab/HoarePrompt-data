Output State: **`i` is 0; `num` is `list0[1] - list0[0] - 1`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` to the variable `num`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the expression simplifies to `list0[1] - list0[0] - 1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `num` is set to the calculated value.
