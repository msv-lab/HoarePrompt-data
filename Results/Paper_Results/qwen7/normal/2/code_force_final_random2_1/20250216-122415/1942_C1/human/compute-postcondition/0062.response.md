Output State: **`i` is `x`, `count` is `count + 1`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code `list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the resulting list in `list0`. The values of `i`, `count`, `num`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
