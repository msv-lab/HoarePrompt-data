Output State: `n` is equal to `ans`, `m` must satisfy `min(n, m) >= 5`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, and `ans` is equal to `2 * ans + (n + min(n, m)) // ((min(n, m)) * (min(n, m)))`.

To understand this, let's break it down:
- The loop runs until `b` reaches the value of `min(n, m) + 1`.
- After the third iteration, `b` was set to 4, meaning `min(n, m)` must be at least 4.
- In the fourth iteration, `b` will be set to 5, as `min(n, m)` is now at least 5.
- The loop continues until `b` equals `min(n, m) + 1`.
- During each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value.
- After all iterations, `ans` will be the sum of all these additions, starting from `n` and including terms up to `b = min(n, m) + 1`.
