You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates the value of \( ans \) as \( n \) plus the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each integer \( b \) from 2 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \). After processing all test cases, it prints the result \( ans \) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, we read two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Initialization:**
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`. This seems to be an initial guess but does not align with the problem requirements.

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of \(b\):**
   - The loop iterates from \(2\) to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation:**
   - The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\). This expression does not account for the gcd term at all.

2. **Missing Key Logic:**
   - The program does not correctly iterate through all possible values of \(a\) for each \(b\).
   - It does not check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

3. **Incorrect Initialization:**
   - Starting `ans` with `n` is not appropriate because it does not consider the constraints and conditions specified in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It does not properly account for the gcd condition and the range of \(a\) for each \(b\).

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
