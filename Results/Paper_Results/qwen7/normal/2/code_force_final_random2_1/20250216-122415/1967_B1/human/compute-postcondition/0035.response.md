Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `b`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is equal to `ans`.
   - `m` must satisfy `min(n, m) >= 2`.
   - `b` is 3.
   - `ans` is increased by `(n + b) // (b * b)`, and now `ans` is `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.

4. **Determine the new value of `b` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `b` starts at 3, it will increment by 1 for each iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `b` will be 4 if it hasn't reached the upper limit yet.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `b <= min(n, m)`.
   - Given that `b` is currently 3, for the next iteration, `b` will be 4.
   - We need to ensure that `min(n, m) >= 4` for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `n` remains the same since it is equal to `ans` and `ans` is not updated yet.
   - `m` must still satisfy `min(n, m) >= 2`.
   - `b` will be 4 for the next iteration.
   - `ans` is not updated yet, so it remains the same as the value before the loop started.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is equal to `ans`, `m` must satisfy `min(n, m) >= 4`, `b` is 4, and `ans` is increased by `(n + b) // (b * b)`**.
