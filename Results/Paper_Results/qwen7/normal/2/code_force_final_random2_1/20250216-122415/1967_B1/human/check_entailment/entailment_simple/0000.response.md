Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the values of `n` and `m` as strings and then converts them to integers. This part is correct.

2. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is intended to count the number of valid pairs, but the logic to update `ans` is incorrect.

3. **Loop for Calculating Valid Pairs**: The loop iterates from `2` to `min(n, m) + 1` and updates `ans` with `(n + b) // (b * b)`. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) should be checked for every pair \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). The current implementation only checks a subset of possible pairs and uses an incorrect formula.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
