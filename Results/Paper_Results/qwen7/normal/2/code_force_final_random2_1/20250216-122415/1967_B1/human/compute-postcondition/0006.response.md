Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer converted from input, `m` is an integer converted from input, `ans` is equal to `n` + 1, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` must be at least 2**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Given that `b` is 2, the expression simplifies to `(n + 2) // 4`. Since `ans` was initially equal to `n`, after the operation, `ans` becomes `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `min(n, m)` must be at least 2 remains valid.
