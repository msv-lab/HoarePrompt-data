Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is the sum of `n` and the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from `min(n, m) + 1` to `max(n, m)`, `b` is `max(n, m) + 1`, and `min(n, m)` is equal to `max(n, m)` if `n != m`, or `n` if `n == m`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for every integer `b` starting from `min(n, m) + 1` up to `max(n, m)`. The variable `b` will be set to `max(n, m) + 1` after the loop completes. If `n` and `m` are equal, then `min(n, m)` will be equal to `n`; otherwise, `min(n, m)` will be equal to the smaller of `n` and `m`.
