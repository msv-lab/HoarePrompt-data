The code `n, m = input().split()` takes two inputs and splits them into `n` and `m`. Since the initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, `b`, and the expression for `ans` are given, these values are not directly affected by the input operation. However, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to the values entered by the user.

The output state after executing the code is:
Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `ans` is equal to `n` + 1 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16 + (n + 5) // 25 + ... + (n + min(n, m)) // (min(n, m) * min(n, m)), `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `min(n, m)` must be at least 2.**
