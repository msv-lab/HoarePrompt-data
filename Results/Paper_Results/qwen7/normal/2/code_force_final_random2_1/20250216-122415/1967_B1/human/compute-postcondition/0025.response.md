Output State: `t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is the sum of `n` and the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from `min(n, m) + 1` to `min(n, m)`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 4`, `min(n, m)` must be at least 3.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for every integer `b` starting from `min(n, m) + 1` up to `min(n, m)`. The variable `b` will be set to `min(n, m) + 4` after the loop completes, and `min(n, m)` must be at least 3.
