Output State: **`n` is equal to `ans`, `m` must satisfy `min(n, m) >= 2`, `b` is 3, and `ans` is increased by `(n + b) // (b * b)`; `ans` is now `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`**.

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Since `b` is 3, the expression simplifies to `(n + 3) // (3 * 3)`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `b`) remain unchanged. The condition for `m` remains the same, i.e., `min(n, m) >= 2`.
