Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):
    [n, m] = input().split()
    [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
    ans = n
    for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
        ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is an integer converted from input, `m` is an integer converted from input, `ans` is equal to `n` + 1 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16 + (n + 5) // 25 + ... + (n + min(n, m)) // (min(n, m) * min(n, m)), `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `min(n, m)` must be at least 2.

This output state represents the final value of `ans` after the loop has completed all its iterations. The loop iterates from `b = 2` up to `b = min(n, m)`. For each iteration, the value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it. The loop continues until `b` exceeds `min(n, m)`, at which point `ans` contains the sum of all these additions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is the sum of `n` and the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from `min(n, m) + 1` to `min(n, m)`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 4`, `min(n, m)` must be at least 3.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for every integer `b` starting from `min(n, m) + 1` up to `min(n, m)`. The variable `b` will be set to `min(n, m) + 4` after the loop completes, and `min(n, m)` must be at least 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `n` is equal to `ans`, `m` must satisfy `min(n, m) >= 5`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, and `ans` is equal to `2 * ans + (n + min(n, m)) // ((min(n, m)) * (min(n, m)))`.

To understand this, let's break it down:
- The loop runs until `b` reaches the value of `min(n, m) + 1`.
- After the third iteration, `b` was set to 4, meaning `min(n, m)` must be at least 4.
- In the fourth iteration, `b` will be set to 5, as `min(n, m)` is now at least 5.
- The loop continues until `b` equals `min(n, m) + 1`.
- During each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value.
- After all iterations, `ans` will be the sum of all these additions, starting from `n` and including terms up to `b = min(n, m) + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
