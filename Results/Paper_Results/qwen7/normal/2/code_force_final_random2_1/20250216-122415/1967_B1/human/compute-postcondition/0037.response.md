Output State: `n` is equal to `ans`, `m` must satisfy `min(n, m) >= 5`, `b` is 5, and `ans` is equal to `3 * ans`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `b` until it reaches the minimum of `n` and `m`. After the third iteration, `b` is 4, and `ans` is `2 * ans`. For the loop to continue, `b` must increase further. Therefore, after all iterations, `b` will be equal to `min(n, m)`, which is at least 5 given the condition. Consequently, `ans` will be incremented by `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each value of `b` from 2 up to `min(n, m)`, resulting in `ans` being multiplied by the number of iterations, which is essentially the count of integers starting from 2 up to `min(n, m)`. Given the last provided state where `b` was 4 and `ans` was `2 * ans`, the next increment would make `ans` `3 * ans`, and so on, until `b` reaches `min(n, m)`.
