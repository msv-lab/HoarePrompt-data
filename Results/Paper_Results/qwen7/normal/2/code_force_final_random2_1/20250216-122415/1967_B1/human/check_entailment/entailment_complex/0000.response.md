Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem statement. Specifically, the calculation of `ans` is incorrect. According to the problem, we need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the provided code calculates `ans` as \(n + \sum_{b=2}^{\min(n, m)} \left(\frac{n + b}{b^2}\right)\), which does not match the required condition. This formula does not account for the gcd condition and the summation should be over all valid pairs \((a, b)\) rather than just adding a constant value.

The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and checking if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds true.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
