Output State: `balance` will be either a positive integer or zero, depending on whether there are more opening parentheses '(' or closing parentheses ')' in the string `s`; `details` will be a list containing tuples where each tuple consists of the current value of `balance`, the negative index `-i`, and the corresponding character `char` from the string `s`. The length of the `details` list will be equal to the length of the string `s`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the `balance` variable will reflect the net difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the string `s`. If there are more opening parentheses, `balance` will be positive; if there are more closing parentheses, `balance` will be zero or negative. The `details` list will contain a tuple for each character in `s`, showing the balance at that point in the string, the negative index of the character, and the character itself.
