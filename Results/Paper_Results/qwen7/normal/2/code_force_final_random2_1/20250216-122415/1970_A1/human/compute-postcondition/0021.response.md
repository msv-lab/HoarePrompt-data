Postcondition: `balance` is either 3 or 1, `details` is a list containing two tuples \[(2, -1, char), (balance, -1, char)\], `s` must contain at least one character, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character in `s` that is either '(', or a character other than '('.

This means that after executing the if-else block, `balance` will be either 3 or 1 depending on whether `char` equals '('. The `details` list will reflect this change in `balance` while keeping the first tuple unchanged. The conditions on `s`, `i`, and `char` remain the same as the precondition.
