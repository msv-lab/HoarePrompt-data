You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
        
    #State: Output State: `balance` will be 0, `details` is a list containing tuples where each tuple consists of the current `balance`, the negative index `-i`, and the corresponding character `char` from the string `s`. The length of `details` will be equal to the length of `s`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `balance` will return to 0 because every opening parenthesis '(' will eventually be matched with a closing parenthesis ')'. The `details` list will contain a tuple for each character in the string `s`, representing the balance at each step of the iteration, the negative index of the character, and the character itself. The exact contents of `details` depend on the content of `s`, but it will include one tuple per character in `s`.
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is a string formed by concatenating characters from the tuples in the sorted list details)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input, which is a balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Tracking Balance and Details:**
   - A variable `balance` is initialized to 0.
   - An empty list `details` is created to store tuples containing the balance, negative index, and character.
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s` using `enumerate` to get both the index and the character.
   - For each character:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - Each tuple `(balance, -i, char)` is appended to the `details` list.

3. **Sorting the Details:**
   - The `details` list is sorted. The sorting criteria are:
     - First, by the balance (increasing order).
     - Second, by the negative index (decreasing order), which effectively means increasing original index due to the negative sign.

4. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list.
   - The join operation uses a generator expression to extract the third element (character) from each tuple in the sorted `details`.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - The result string is printed.

### Correctness Check:

- **Balancing and Index Tracking:**
  - The program correctly tracks the balance and the original position of each character.
  - The negative index ensures that the original order is preserved when sorting by balance.

- **Sorting Criteria:**
  - The sorting criteria ensure that the prefixes maintain their non-negative balance property during the shuffle process.

- **Result Construction:**
  - The result string is constructed by joining the characters in the correct order based on the sorted details.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles all characters in the input string, ensuring that the final output is a valid balanced shuffle.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
