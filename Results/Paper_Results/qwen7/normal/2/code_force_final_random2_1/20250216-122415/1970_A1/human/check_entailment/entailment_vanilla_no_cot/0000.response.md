Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic for the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance of the prefix up to each character in the input string `s`.

2. **Details Storage**: It stores the balance, the negative position (to ensure correct sorting), and the character in a list `details`. Using the negative position ensures that in case of equal balances, characters from earlier positions come first, as required.

3. **Sorting**: The `details` list is sorted according to the specified criteria (increasing balance, decreasing position).

4. **Result Construction**: The program constructs the final result by joining the characters from the sorted list.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the resulting balanced shuffle sequence.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation, the provided solution is correct and will produce the expected output for any valid balanced parentheses sequence.
