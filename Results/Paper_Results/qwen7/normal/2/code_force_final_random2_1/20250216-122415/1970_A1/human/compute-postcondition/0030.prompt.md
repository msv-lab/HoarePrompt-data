You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
        
    #State: Output State: `balance` will be 0, `details` is a list containing tuples where each tuple consists of the current `balance`, the negative index `-i`, and the corresponding character `char` from the string `s`. The length of `details` will be equal to the length of `s`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `balance` will return to 0 because every opening parenthesis '(' will eventually be matched with a closing parenthesis ')'. The `details` list will contain a tuple for each character in the string `s`, representing the balance at each step of the iteration, the negative index of the character, and the character itself. The exact contents of `details` depend on the content of `s`, but it will include one tuple per character in `s`.
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is a string formed by concatenating characters from the tuples in the sorted list details)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `s`, a non-empty string of balanced parentheses, and returns True if `s` is a valid balanced parentheses sequence, otherwise it returns False.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
