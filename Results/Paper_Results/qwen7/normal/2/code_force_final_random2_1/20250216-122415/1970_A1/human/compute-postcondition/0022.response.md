Postcondition: `balance` is either 3 or 1, `details` is a list containing two tuples \[(2, -1, char), (balance, -1, char)\], `s` must contain at least one character, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character in `s` that is either '(', or a character other than '('.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `balance` will be either 3 or 1 depending on whether `char` is '('. The list `details` will always contain the same first tuple \[(2, -1, char)\] and the second tuple will have its third element as `balance`. The string `s` and the index `i` remain unchanged, and `char` remains the third character in `s` which is either '(', or a character other than '('.
