Output State: **`balance` is -1, `details` is an empty list, `s` must contain at least one character, `i` is 0, `char` is a character in `s` that is not '('**

The code `balance -= 1` decreases the value of `balance` by 1. Since the initial value of `balance` was 0, it now becomes -1. The other variables (`details`, `s`, `i`, and `char`) are not affected by this operation.
