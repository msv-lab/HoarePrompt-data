Output State: **`balance` is 0, `details` is a sorted list of tuples, `result` is a string created by joining the characters from the tuples in `details`.**

Explanation: The code `result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)` iterates over the `details` list and joins the third element (character) from each tuple into a string. The first and second elements of each tuple are ignored. The `balance` and `details` variables remain unchanged. The `result` variable is assigned the concatenated string of characters from the tuples in `details`.
