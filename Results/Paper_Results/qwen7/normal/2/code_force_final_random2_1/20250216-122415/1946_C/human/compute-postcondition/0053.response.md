Output State: **`adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, and `t` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `adj` which is a list of empty lists with a length of `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
