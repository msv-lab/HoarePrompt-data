Output State: **`numCuts` is 0; `R` is `x`; `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

Explanation: The variable `R` is assigned the value of `x`. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `numCuts` is still 0, and `leftover` is still the result of the function call `dfs(1, 1)`.
