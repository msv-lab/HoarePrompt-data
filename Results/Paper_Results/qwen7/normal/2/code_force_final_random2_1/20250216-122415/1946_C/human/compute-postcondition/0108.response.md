Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the integer entered as the first number, `b` is the integer entered as the second number, `adj[b]` contains `[b, a]`**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[a, b]`. After executing the code, `a` is appended to `adj[b]`, making `adj[b]` contain `[b, a]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
