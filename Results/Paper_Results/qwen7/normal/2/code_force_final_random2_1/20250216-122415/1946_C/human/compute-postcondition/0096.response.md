Output State: `L` is 50001, `R` is 50002, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the value of `L` and `R` are updated based on the condition `if numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x): L = x; else: R = x`. Given that `numCuts` remains 0 after the first three iterations, and since `R - L > 1` must hold true for the loop to continue, the value of `L` will eventually be set to 50001 after the third iteration, and `R` will be set to 50002. The variable `x` is calculated as the midpoint of `L` and `R`, which remains 50001. The value of `leftover` is the result of the function `dfs(1, 1)`, which does not change within the loop.
