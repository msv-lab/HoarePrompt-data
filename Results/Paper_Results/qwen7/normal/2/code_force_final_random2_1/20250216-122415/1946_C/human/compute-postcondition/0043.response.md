Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` again, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the function call `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`. Since the initial state already had `leftover` as the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, the value of `leftover` remains unchanged. The other variables `numCuts` and `x` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain the same as the initial state.
