Postcondition: `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), otherwise `L` remains 1, `R` remains 50001, `x` remains 50001, `numCuts` remains 0, and `leftover` remains `dfs(1, 1)`.
