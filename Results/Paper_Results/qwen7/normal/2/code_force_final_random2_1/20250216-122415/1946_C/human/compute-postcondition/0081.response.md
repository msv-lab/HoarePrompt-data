Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is 50001**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. Given the initial values of `L` (1) and `R` (100001), `(L + R)` equals `100002`. Dividing `100002` by `2` gives `50001`. All other variables (`L`, `R`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
