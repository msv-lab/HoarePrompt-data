Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the element at index `a` which now contains `[b, a]` and `[b]`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 3, `n` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends `b` to the list at index `a` in the `adj` list. Since `adj[a]` was initially `[b, a]`, after appending `b`, `adj[a]` becomes `[b, a, b]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
