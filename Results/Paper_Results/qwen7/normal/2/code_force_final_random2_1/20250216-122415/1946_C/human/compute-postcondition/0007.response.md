Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the element at index `a` which now contains `[b, a]`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list at index `b` in the `adj` list. Initially, the list at index `a` contained `[b]`. After executing the code, the list at index `b` now contains both `a` and `b`, i.e., `[b, a]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
