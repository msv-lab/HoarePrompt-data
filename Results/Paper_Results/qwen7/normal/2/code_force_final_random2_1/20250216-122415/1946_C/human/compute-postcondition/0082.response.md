Output State: **`numCuts` is 0**

Explanation: The code `numCuts = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `numCuts`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the updated state includes `numCuts` being set to 0 while keeping the other variables (`L`, `R`, `x`, `leftover`) in their original states.
