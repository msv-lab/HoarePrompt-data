Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, `x` is now the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, and `R` is greater than `L` by more than 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `numCuts` to 0, which updates its value. The other variables (`leftover`, `x`, `L`, and `R`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
