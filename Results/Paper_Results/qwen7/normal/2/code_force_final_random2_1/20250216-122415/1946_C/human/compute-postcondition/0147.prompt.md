You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each set of input data, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The adjacency list adj represents a tree where adj[i] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of vertex i. The value of x is initially set to 1 and R is set to 100001.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for z in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        
        adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        L = 1
        
        R = int(100000.0 + 1)
        
        numCuts = 0
        
        while R - L > 1:
            x = (L + R) // 2
            numCuts = 0
            leftover = dfs(1, 1)
            if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
                L = x
            else:
                R = x
        
        print(L)
        
    #State: Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the binary search process converges such that `L` and `R` become equal. Given that `numCuts` remains 0 throughout the iterations, the condition `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)` is never satisfied. Therefore, `L` and `R` both end up being 50001. The variable `x` is set to the final value of `L` (or `R`), which is 50001. The value of `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which is not modified by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on predefined variables t, n, k, adj, x, and R. It returns nothing (None).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
