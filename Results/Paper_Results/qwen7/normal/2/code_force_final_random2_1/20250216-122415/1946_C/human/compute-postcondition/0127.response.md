Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the integer division of `(L + R) // 2`. Given that `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, `(L + R) // 2` evaluates to `(50001 + 100001) // 2 = 150002 // 2 = 75001`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
