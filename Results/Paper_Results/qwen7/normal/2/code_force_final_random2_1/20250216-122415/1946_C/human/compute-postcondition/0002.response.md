Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer from the first space-separated input, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input and splits them into `n` and `k`. These values are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `t`, `x`, `R`, and `z` remain unchanged.
