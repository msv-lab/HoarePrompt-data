Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` and `R` must be adjusted such that `R - L > 1`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `(L + R) // 2`, which is the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. The values of `numCuts`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the condition `R - L > 1` must still be satisfied.
