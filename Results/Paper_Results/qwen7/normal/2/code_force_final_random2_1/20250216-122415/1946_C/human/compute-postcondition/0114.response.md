Output State: **`L` is 1, the loop has executed `n-1` times, so `i` is `n-2`, the variable `n` is greater than 1, the adjacency list `adj` is fully constructed such that for every edge (a, b) provided by the input, both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain each other.**

The code simply initializes `L` to 1 and does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or the adjacency list `adj`. Therefore, the output state retains all the preconditions and updates only the new assignment to `L`.
