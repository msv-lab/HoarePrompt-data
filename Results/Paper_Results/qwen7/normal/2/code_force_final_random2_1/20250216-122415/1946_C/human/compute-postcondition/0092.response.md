Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is `(L + R) // 2`, `R` must be adjusted such that `R - L > 1`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The value of `L` is updated to be `(L + R) // 2`. The other variables (`numCuts`, `R`, `x`, and `leftover`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `R` remains the same, i.e., `R - L > 1`.
