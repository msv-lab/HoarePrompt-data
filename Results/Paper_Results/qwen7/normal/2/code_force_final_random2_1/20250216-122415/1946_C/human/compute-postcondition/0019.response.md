Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the elements at indices `a` and `b` which contain each other, `a` and `b` are the integers from the inputs, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `L` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `R = int(100000.0 + 1)` changes the value of `R` from its initial value (which was 100001) to itself, effectively not changing it. All other variables remain unchanged.
