Output State: **The loop has executed `n-1` times, so `i` is `n-2`. The variable `n` is greater than 1. The adjacency list `adj` is fully constructed such that for every edge (a, b) provided by the input, both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain each other.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-2` because the loop runs `n-1` times. The variable `n` remains greater than 1 since it was initially greater than 1 and no operations in the loop change its value. The adjacency list `adj` will be completely filled according to the edges provided by the input, ensuring that each node points to every node it is connected to.
