Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the elements at indices `a` and `b` which contain each other, `a` and `b` are the integers from the inputs, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `L` is 1, `numCuts` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
