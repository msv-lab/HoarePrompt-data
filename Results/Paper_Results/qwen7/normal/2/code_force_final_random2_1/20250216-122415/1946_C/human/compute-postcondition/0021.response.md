Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions under which it can execute the first time.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while R - L > 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

To determine whether the loop can execute the first time, we need to check the values of `R` and `L`:

- `R` is given as 100001.
- `L` is given as 1.

The loop condition `R - L > 1` simplifies to:
\[ 100001 - 1 > 1 \]
\[ 100000 > 1 \]

This condition is true, so the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments to the states.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the states of the variables involved in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the elements at indices `a` and `b` which contain each other, `a` and `b` are the integers from the inputs, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `L` is 1, `numCuts` is 0**
