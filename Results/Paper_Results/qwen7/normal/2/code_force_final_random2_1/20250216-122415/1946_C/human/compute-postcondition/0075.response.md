Output State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`).**

Explanation: The code `L = x` updates the value of `L` to be equal to `x`. Since `x` is 50001, `L` is now also 50001. The values of `R`, `x`, `numCuts`, and the condition involving `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from the initial state.
