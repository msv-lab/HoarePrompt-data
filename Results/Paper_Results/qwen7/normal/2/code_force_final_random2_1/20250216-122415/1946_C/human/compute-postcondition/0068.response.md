Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001**

Explanation: The initial state is that `L` is 1. The code snippet sets `R` to the integer value of `100000.0 + 1`, which evaluates to 100001. Since no other variables are affected, `L` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `L` is 1, `R` is 100001.
