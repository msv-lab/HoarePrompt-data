Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a` is the integer input converted to int
   - `b` is the second integer input converted to int
   - `adj[b]` contains the value `[b, a]`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n - 1`. Given that `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 3 (since 2 < n - 1 implies n > 3).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

6. **Other variables (`a`, `b`, and `adj[b]`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head**.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is the integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[b]` contains the value `[b, a]`**
