Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` and `R` must be adjusted such that `R - L > 1`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

This means that the function `dfs(1, 1)` was called, and its return value was assigned to the variable `leftover`. All other variables remain in their initial or previously described states.
