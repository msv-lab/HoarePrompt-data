Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the element at index `a` which now contains `[b]`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj` is a list of lists where each sublist is empty. After executing the code, the sublist at index `a` in `adj` now contains the element `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
