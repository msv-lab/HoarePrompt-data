Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `adj[a]` contains the value `b`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` and `b` are the first and second integer inputs respectively, and `adj` is not defined before this line, it implies that `adj` is a dictionary or a similar data structure where keys are integers and values are lists. After executing this line, the list associated with key `a` in the `adj` dictionary will contain the value `b`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
