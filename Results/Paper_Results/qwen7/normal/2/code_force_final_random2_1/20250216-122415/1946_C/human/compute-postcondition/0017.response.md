Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the elements at indices `a` and `b` which contain each other, `a` and `b` are the integers from the inputs, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before, all pairs of integers provided as input have been added to the adjacency list `adj`.

This final state means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the adjacency list `adj` will represent a graph where each pair of integers provided as input defines an edge between two nodes. The variable `i` will be set to `n - 1`, indicating the total number of iterations the loop executed. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `R`, `z`, `k`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
