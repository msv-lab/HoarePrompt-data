Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: 
- The variable `numCuts` remains unchanged and is still 0.
- The variable `leftover` remains unchanged and is still the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.
- The variable `L` is updated to be equal to `(L + R) // 2`. The other variables `R` and `x` are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain as they were initially.
