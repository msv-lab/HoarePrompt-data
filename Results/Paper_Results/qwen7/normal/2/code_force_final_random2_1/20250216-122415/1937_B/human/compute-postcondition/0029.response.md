Postcondition: `a` is a list of lists where the first sublist has at least one element at index `i + 3` equal to '1' and the second sublist has an element at index `i` equal to '0'; `s` includes elements from the first sublist of `a` up to the element at index `i + 1`, followed by the element from the second sublist of `a` at index `i`; `x` is equal to `i + 1` if `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, otherwise `x` remains equal to `i`.
