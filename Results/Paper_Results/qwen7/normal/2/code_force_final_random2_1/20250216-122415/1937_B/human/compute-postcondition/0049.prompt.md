Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. `s` will contain the concatenation of the first sublist of `a` up to the last index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, followed by the corresponding element from the second sublist of `a`. If no such index exists, `s` will be the concatenation of the entire first sublist and the last element of the second sublist. `x` will be the index `i` where the condition was last met, or `n - 1` if the condition was never met. `t` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
        t = x - i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `x` is initialized to a value that satisfies the condition or `n - 1` if the condition is never met, `a` is a list of integers, the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `s`, and `t` is `x - i + 1`. If the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` is the same value as before, `a` is a list of integers, the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `s`, and `t` is 2, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is the same value as before, `a` is a list of integers, the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `s`, and `t` is 0 because either the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is true, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, setting `t` to 0, or the condition is false, in which case `t` remains 2 as there is no else part to change its value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
