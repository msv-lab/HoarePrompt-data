Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original string representation of an integer and the second element is the new integer input as a string**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the result of `input()` to the list `a`. Since `input()` returns a string, the list `a` now contains two elements: the original string representation of an integer and the new integer input as a string. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
