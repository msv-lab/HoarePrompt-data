Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `a` is an empty list.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list `a` stays empty.
