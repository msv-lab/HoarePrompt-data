Postcondition: `i` is 0, `x` is initialized to a value that satisfies the condition or `n - 1` if the condition is never met, `a` is a list of integers, the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `s`, and if `a[0][:i + 1]` equals `s[:i + 1]`, then `t` is set to `x - i + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the condition is false, no changes are made to `t`.
