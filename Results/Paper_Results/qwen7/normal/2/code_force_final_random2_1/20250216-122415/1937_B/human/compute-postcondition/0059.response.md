Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and two binary strings \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \). It identifies a segment in \( a_1 \) that matches a segment in \( a_2 \) and calculates the length of this segment. The function then prints the matching segment and the length of this segment.**
