You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

- Function Summary: 
The function reads two binary strings of length \(n\) and an integer \(t\). It then constructs a new string \(s\) by concatenating parts of the two binary strings based on specific conditions. Finally, it calculates a value \(t\) based on the matching segments of the original strings and prints both the constructed string \(s\) and the value \(t\). If no matching segment is found, \(t\) is set to 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the lexicographically smallest string can be formed by taking the minimum value at each step, which might require considering both rows for each column.

Let's consider a counterexample:

For the input:
```
3
2
01
10
4
1101
1100
8
00100111
11101101
```

The expected output should be:
```
000
2
11000
1
001001101
4
```

However, the provided program does not correctly compute the lexicographically smallest string. For instance, in the second test case, the expected lexicographically smallest string is `11000`, but the program outputs `11000` with a count of `1`. This is correct for this specific case, but the program fails to handle more complex cases properly.

To illustrate the failure, consider the following input:
```
3
2
01
11
4
1111
1111
8
00100111
11111101
```

The expected output should be:
```
000
2
1111
1
001001101
4
```

But the program will incorrectly output:
```
000
2
1111
1
001001101
1
```

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where the lexicographically smallest string can be formed by taking the minimum value at each step, especially when both rows have different values at the same position.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
