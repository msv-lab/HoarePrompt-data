Postcondition: `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `i` is 1, `t` is 2, `a` is a list of lists where the second sublist has at least `x` elements, `s` is a string, and if `a[1][i:x]` equals `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the postcondition remains unchanged.
