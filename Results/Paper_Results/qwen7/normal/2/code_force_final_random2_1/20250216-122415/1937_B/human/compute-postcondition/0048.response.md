Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is the same value as before, `a` is a list of integers, the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `s`, and `t` is 0 because either the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is true, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, setting `t` to 0, or the condition is false, in which case `t` remains 2 as there is no else part to change its value.
