Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `data = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements based on whitespace, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `data`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was only defined initially and not modified by the code.
