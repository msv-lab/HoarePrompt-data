Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and it represents the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The code `times = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This integer is stored in the variable `times`. The initial conditions for `t` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the list of non-negative integers `a_1, \ldots, a_n` (where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^{31}) remain unchanged for the next steps, but now `times` holds the specific number of these test cases.
