Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers (though its contents are not specified, they do not affect the value of `ans`).
- `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros.
- `x` is 0.
- `ans` is 10000.

The loop iterates over each element in the `cnt` list. Since `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros, `x` will be 0 for each iteration. Inside the loop, `ans` is incremented by `max(0, x - 1)`. Given that `x` is 0, `max(0, x - 1)` will be 0 for all iterations except the last one. In the last iteration, although `x` is still 0, `ans` is incremented once more because the loop runs 10001 times and starts with `ans` already at 10000.

Therefore, `ans` will be incremented 10000 times, starting from 10000, resulting in `ans` being 20000 after the loop completes. However, since the initial value of `ans` is 10000 and it is only incremented once per iteration, `ans` will remain 10000 after the loop completes.

Output: **10000**
