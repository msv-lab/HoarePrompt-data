Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that contains at least two elements, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` elements where the first element is 1 and the second element is 1, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `ans` is 10000, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. Since `x` is the second element in the list `a`, the value at index 1 (second element) in the list `cnt` is incremented from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
