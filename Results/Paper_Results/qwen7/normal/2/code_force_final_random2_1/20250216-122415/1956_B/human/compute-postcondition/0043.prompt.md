Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `a` is a list of integers that contains at least `n` elements, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element in `cnt` is incremented according to the frequency of each integer in `a`, `x` is the last element in the list `a`, and `n` is the input integer.
Code of the loop:
for x in cnt:
    ans += max(0, x - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is increased by max(0, x - 1)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is increased by max(0, x - 1), `cnt` must still contain elements to iterate over and `ans` is now equal to its previous value plus max(0, x - 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is now equal to its previous value plus `max(0, x - 1)`, `x` is the next element in `cnt`, and `cnt` must still contain elements to iterate over.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
