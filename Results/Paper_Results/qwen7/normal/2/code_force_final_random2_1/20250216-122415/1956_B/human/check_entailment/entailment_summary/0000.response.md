Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads lines from standard input but only processes every other line starting from the third line. This means it skips the first two lines which contain important information: the number of test cases (`t`) and the number of cards `n` for each test case. The program should read these values and handle each test case accordingly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of counts of each unique element in the split line, dividing each count by 3. This calculation does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get by optimally selecting cards, not to perform a division by 3.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The program does not implement any logic to simulate the optimal strategy for both you and Nene. The problem requires you to determine the maximum number of points you can get assuming Nene always plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. The provided program does not account for this strategic aspect.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
