Output State: The list `cnt` will be updated such that for each index `i` from `0` to `n`, `cnt[i]` will be equal to the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. All other variables (`a` and `ans`) will retain their initial states.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt` will reflect the frequency of each integer present in the list `a`. For example, if `a` contains three `2`s, two `3`s, and one `5`, then `cnt[2]` will be `3`, `cnt[3]` will be `2`, and `cnt[5]` will be `1`. All other indices in `cnt` (where no elements in `a` match) will remain `0`.
