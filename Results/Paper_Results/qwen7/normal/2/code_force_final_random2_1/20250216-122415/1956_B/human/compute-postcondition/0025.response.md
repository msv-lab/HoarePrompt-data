Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros, `x` is 0, `ans` is 10000, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `cnt`, `x`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The number of iterations left (`new_input - 1`) is also not affected by this code snippet.
