Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that contains at least one element, `cnt` is a list of n+1 elements where the first element is 1 and all others are 0, `x` is 0, `ans` is 10000, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `cnt[x] += 1` increments the count at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. Since `x` is initially 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented from 0 to 1. All other elements in `cnt` remain 0. The other variables (`a`, `ans`, and `n`) are not affected by this operation.
