Output State: **`t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `y1` is `1`, `x2` is `x2 - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `a` is either `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1`, or `m - y1` if `y2 < y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, and `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`.**

Explanation:
- The code sets `y1` to `1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `t`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y2`, `a`, `b`, and the condition `y1 <= y2` remain as they were initially.
