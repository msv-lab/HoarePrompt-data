Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are elements of the list `r` where `r[0] = n`, `r[1] = m`, `r[2] = x1`, `r[3] = y1`, `r[4] = x2`, and `r[5] = y2`.
- The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'draw'`.

Output: **'draw'**
