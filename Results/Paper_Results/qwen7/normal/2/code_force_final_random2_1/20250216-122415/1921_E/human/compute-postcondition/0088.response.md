Output State: **`t` is abs(y2 - y1), `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is x1 + a, `y1` is r[3], `x2` is r[4], `y2` is r[5], `a` is either y1 - 1 if y2 >= y1, or m - y1 if y2 < y1, `b` is x2 - x1**

Explanation: The code `x1 += a` increments the value of `x1` by the value of `a`. The value of `a` is determined based on the condition involving `y1` and `y2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
