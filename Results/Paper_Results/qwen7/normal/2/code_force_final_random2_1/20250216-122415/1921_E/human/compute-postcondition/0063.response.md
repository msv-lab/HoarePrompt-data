Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2] + 1 + a, `x2` is r[4] - a, `y1` is either r[3] + 1 or r[3] - 1, `y2` is either 1 or m, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. The condition `(b // 2 > a and abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c and (1 <= y1 <= m) and (1 <= x1 <= n))` is true.
