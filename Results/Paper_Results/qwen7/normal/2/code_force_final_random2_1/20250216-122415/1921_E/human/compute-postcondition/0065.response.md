Output State: **The program returns the absolute difference between y2 and y1, which is given as t.**

Given the conditions and initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is `r[0]`.
- `m` is `r[1]`.
- `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`.
- `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
- `y1` is either `r[3] + 1` or `r[3] - 1`.
- `y2` is either `1` or `m`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.

Since the return statement does not depend on any calculation but directly refers to `t`, the program returns `t`, which is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
