Postcondition: `t` is an integer, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is either `r[1]` or `r[2]`, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `y1` is either `1` or `r[2]`, `x2` is `x2 - a`, `y2` is either `r[5] - a` or `y2 + a`, `a` is either `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1`, or `m - y1` if `y2 < y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, and `(x2 > x1 and x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n)`; `c` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `t` will be the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` under certain conditions, `n` remains unchanged as `r[0]`, `m` could be either `r[1]` or `r[2]`, `x1` increases by `a`, `y1` changes to either `1` or `r[2]`, `x2` decreases by `a`, `y2` changes to either `r[5] - a` or `y2 + a`, `a` is determined based on whether `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, `b` represents the difference between `x2` and `x1`, and the condition `(x2 > x1 and x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n)` must still hold true. Additionally, `c` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2` depending on the case.
