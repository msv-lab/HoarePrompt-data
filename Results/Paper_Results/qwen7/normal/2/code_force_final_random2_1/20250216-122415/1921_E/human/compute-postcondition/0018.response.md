Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2], `y1` is r[3] + 1, `x2` is r[4], `y2` is r[5], and `x2` is greater than `x1`. The difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y2` is greater than `y1`**.

This means that the value of `y1` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions involving `x1`, `x2`, and `y1` and `y2` also remain valid.
