Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly handles the input format and splits the input into the required variables.
2. The logic for determining the winner is well-defined and follows the rules of the game:
   - Alice wins if she can force Bob into a position where he cannot make a move or if he is forced to move into a position where Alice can capture him.
   - Bob wins if he can force Alice into a similar situation.
   - A draw occurs if neither player can win under optimal play.
3. The program checks various conditions to determine the outcome:
   - If Bob is in the first row (`x2 <= x1`), the game is a draw.
   - If the difference in rows between Alice and Bob is odd and Alice can force Bob into a corner, Alice wins.
   - If the difference in rows is even and Bob can force Alice into a corner, Bob wins.
4. The program handles edge cases and ensures that the coordinates stay within the board boundaries.
5. The logic seems to cover all possible scenarios as per the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the analysis, the annotated program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the given constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
