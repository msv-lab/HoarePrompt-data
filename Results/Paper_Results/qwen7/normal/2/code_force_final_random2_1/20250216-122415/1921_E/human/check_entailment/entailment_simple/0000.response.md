Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Base Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the base case where Bob is in the first row (i.e., \(x_b = 1\)). In this scenario, Bob cannot move, and the game ends in a draw.

3. **Odd Difference Check**: The program checks if the difference between Alice's and Bob's row positions (\(x_2 - x_1\)) is odd. If it is, the program proceeds to handle the scenario where Alice can potentially win by moving to Bob's position. The logic here is sound, ensuring that Alice can force a win if the conditions are met.

4. **Even Difference Check**: If the difference is even, the program correctly handles the scenario where Bob can potentially win by moving to Alice's position. The logic here is also sound, ensuring that Bob can force a win if the conditions are met.

5. **Movement Logic**: The program correctly simulates the movements of Alice and Bob, adjusting their positions based on the rules provided. It ensures that the new positions are within the bounds of the board.

6. **Winning Conditions**: The program correctly identifies when Alice or Bob can win by checking if they can move to the other player's position. The logic for determining whether Alice or Bob can win is sound.

7. **Draw Condition**: The program correctly identifies the draw condition when neither player can force a win. This is handled appropriately by returning "Draw".

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the provided rules and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
