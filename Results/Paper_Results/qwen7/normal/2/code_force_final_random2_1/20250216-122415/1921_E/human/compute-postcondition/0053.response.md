Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2] + 1 + a, `y1` is r[3], `x2` is r[4] - a, `y2` is 1, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, and `y1` is equal to r[3] - a, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation: The code `y1 -= a` subtracts `a` from `y1`. Since `y1` was originally `r[3] + 1`, after the operation, `y1` becomes `r[3] - a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions involving `x1`, `x2`, and `y1` and `y2` remain valid as stated in the initial state.
