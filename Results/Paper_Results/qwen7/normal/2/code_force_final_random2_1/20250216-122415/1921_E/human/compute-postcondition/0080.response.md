Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2], `y1` is r[3], `x2` is r[4], `y2` is r[5], `a` is `y1 - 1`, and `(y1 != y2)` with `y2` being greater than or equal to `y1`.**

In this state, the value of `a` is calculated as `y1 - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values from the precondition.
