Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2] + 1 + a, `y1` is either r[3] + 1 or r[3] - 1, `x2` is r[4] - a, `y2` is r[5], `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.
