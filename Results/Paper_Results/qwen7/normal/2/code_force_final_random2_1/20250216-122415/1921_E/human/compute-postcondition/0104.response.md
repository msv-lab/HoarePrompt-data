Output State: **`t` is abs(y2 - y1), `n` is r[0], `m` is r[2], `x1` is x1 + a, `y1` is r[2], `x2` is x2 - a, `y2` is y2 + a, `a` is either y1 - 1 if y2 < y1, or m - y1 if y2 >= y1, `b` is x2 - x1, and (x2 > x1 and x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n); c is m - y2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `m - y2` to `c`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `c` is directly calculated based on the current values of `m` and `y2`.
