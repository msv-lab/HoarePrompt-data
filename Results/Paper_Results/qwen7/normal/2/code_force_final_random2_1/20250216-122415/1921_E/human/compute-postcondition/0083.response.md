Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2], `y1` is r[3], `x2` is r[4], `y2` is r[5], `a` is m - y1, and `y2` is less than `y1`.**

In this output state, the variable `a` is assigned the value of `m - y1`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
