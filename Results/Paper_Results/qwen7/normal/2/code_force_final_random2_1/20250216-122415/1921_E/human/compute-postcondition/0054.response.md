Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2] + 1 + a, `y1` is r[3], `x2` is r[4] - a, `y2` is 1, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, `y1` is equal to r[3] - a, `c` is y1 - 1**.

This means that the variable `c` is now assigned the value of `y1 - 1`. All other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
