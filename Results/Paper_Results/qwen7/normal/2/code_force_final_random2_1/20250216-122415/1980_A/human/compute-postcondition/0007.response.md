Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the string `p`.

2. **Understand the String `p`**: The string `p` is given as `'ABCDEF'`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over each character in `p`, the initial value of `i` should be the first character of `p`.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `i` starts with the first character of `p` and that `p` remains unchanged.

Given these points, let's construct the required state:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `n` is an input integer (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `m` is an input integer (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `s` is a string input by the user (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `ans` is 0 (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `p` is the string `'ABCDEF'`.
- `i` should start with the first character of `p`, which is `'A'`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEF'**
