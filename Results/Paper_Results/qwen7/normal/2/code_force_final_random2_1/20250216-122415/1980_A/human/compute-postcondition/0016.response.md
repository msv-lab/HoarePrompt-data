Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in p`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 'B'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEF'
   - The postcondition is that if `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is equal to `m + ans`.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating through the string `p`, the next value of `i` will be the next character in the string `p`. The current value of `i` is 'B', so the next value will be 'C'.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `p` to iterate over. Since `p` is 'ABCDEF' and the next character is 'C', the loop will execute again.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `p`. The variable `ans` and the postcondition involving `hmp` and `m` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEF'**
