Output State: **`i` is one of the keys in `hmp`, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is `6 + (m - hmp[i])`, `hmp` is {'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 1}, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and the value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `m - hmp[i]`. Since `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `m - hmp[i]` will be a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
