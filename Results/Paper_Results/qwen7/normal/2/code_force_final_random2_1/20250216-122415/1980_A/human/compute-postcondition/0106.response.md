Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to the character 'A'.
- `p` is a string 'ABCDEF'.
- `ans` is explicitly given as the integer 10.
- `hmp` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' and all values set to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.

The `print(ans)` statement will simply print the value of the variable `ans`.
