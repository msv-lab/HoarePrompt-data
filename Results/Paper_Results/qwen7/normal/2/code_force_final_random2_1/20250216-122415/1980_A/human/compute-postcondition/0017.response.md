Output State: **`i` is 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is undefined**

Explanation: The code `ans += m` attempts to add the value of `m` to `ans`. However, neither `ans` nor `m` is defined in the initial state, so the operation cannot be performed. As a result, `ans` remains undefined, and the values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
