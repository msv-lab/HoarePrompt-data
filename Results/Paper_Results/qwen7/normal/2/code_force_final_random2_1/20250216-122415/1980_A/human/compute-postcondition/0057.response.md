Output State: `i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', and `ans` is `3 * m`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each character in the string `p` which is 'ABCDEF'. For each iteration, if the character `i` is not found in the `hmp` (which is initially empty), `ans` is incremented by `m`. This happens for the first three characters 'A', 'B', and 'C' as they are not in `hmp` initially. After these three iterations, `i` becomes 'C'. The next three characters 'D', 'E', and 'F' are also not in `hmp` because they were not added during the first three iterations. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by `m` three more times. Since the loop increments `ans` by `m` a total of six times, the final value of `ans` is `6 * m / 2 = 3 * m`. The variable `p` remains 'ABCDEF' and `i` takes on the last value from the string, which is 'F'.
