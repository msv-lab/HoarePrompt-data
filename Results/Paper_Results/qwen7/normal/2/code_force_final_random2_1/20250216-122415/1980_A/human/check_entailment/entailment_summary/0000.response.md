Reasoning:
The given program aims to calculate the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that each of the difficulty levels 'A' to 'F' appears at least `m` times across all rounds. The program uses the following steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems in the bank) and `m` (number of rounds).
3. It reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.
4. It initializes a counter to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
5. It iterates over the difficulty levels 'A' to 'F':
   - If a difficulty level is not present in the counter, it assumes Vlad needs to create `m` problems for that level.
   - If a difficulty level is present but its count is less than `m`, it calculates the difference and adds that to the total count of additional problems needed.
6. Finally, it prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the logic implemented in the program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed. The program handles all specified constraints and examples accurately.

Correctness: **True**
