Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `hmp` must contain the character 'F'.
- The loop iterates over each key `i` in `hmp`.

### Loop Head Analysis
- The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is the key from `hmp`.
- No other variables are directly modified within the loop head itself (e.g., `ans` or `m`).

### Conditions for the Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another key `i` in `hmp`.
- Since `hmp` must contain the character 'F' and the loop iterates over each key in `hmp`, the presence of 'F' ensures that there is at least one key in `hmp`.

### Adjusting the State
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is the key `i` that the loop will use in the next iteration.
- Since `hmp` contains 'F', the next key `i` could be 'F' or any other key present in `hmp`.

### Conclusion
- The state of `hmp` remains the same as it must still contain 'F'.
- The state of `i` changes to the next key in `hmp`.

### Final State
State: **`hmp` must contain the character 'F', `i` is the next key in `hmp`**
