Output State: **`i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', and `ans` is the value of `ans` before the addition plus the value of `m`.**

The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. Since no specific initial value for `ans` was given, it remains as it was before the operation, but it now holds the sum of its previous value and `m`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
