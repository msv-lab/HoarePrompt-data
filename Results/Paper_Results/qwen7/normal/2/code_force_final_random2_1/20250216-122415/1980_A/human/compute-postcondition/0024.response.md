Output State: **`hmp` must contain the character 'F', and the current value of `hmp[i]` is now equal to `m`; `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `m - hmp[i]`. Since `hmp[i]` was less than `m`, `m - hmp[i]` is a positive value. After the operation, `hmp[i]` is updated to `m`. The condition that `hmp` must contain the character 'F' remains unchanged.
