Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `ans` is 0, `p` is a string 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in the string `s`**.

The code `hmp = Counter(s)` creates a `Counter` object named `hmp` that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
