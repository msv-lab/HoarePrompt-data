Output State: **`i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is equal to `m`**.

The code `ans += m` adds the value of `m` to `ans`. However, since `m` is not defined before this line of code, its value is not specified. Therefore, `ans` is updated to be equal to `m`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
