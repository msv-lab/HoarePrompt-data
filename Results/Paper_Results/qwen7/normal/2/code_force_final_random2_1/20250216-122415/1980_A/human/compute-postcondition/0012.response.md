Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `p`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 'A'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEF'
   - If `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is equal to `m`

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop iterates over each character in `p`, the next value of `i` will be the next character in the string `p`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - The next value of `i` will be 'B' (since the previous value was 'A').
   - The value of `p` remains unchanged as it is the string being iterated over.
   - The condition for `ans` (if `i` is not in `hmp`) remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEF', and if `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is equal to `m`**
