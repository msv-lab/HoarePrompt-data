Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in hmp:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `hmp`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 'F'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEF'
   - `ans` is 4 * `m` + (`m` - `hmp`['F'])
   - `hmp` is a dictionary with key 'F' mapped to `m`

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as there are keys left in the dictionary `hmp`. Since `i` is currently set to 'F', the loop will move to the next key in the dictionary.

4. **Update the state**: After the current iteration where `i` was 'F', the next key in the dictionary `hmp` will be the next value of `i`. Since `hmp` contains only one key 'F', the next key (and thus the next value of `i`) does not exist, meaning the loop will terminate.

However, if we assume the problem intends for us to consider the next logical step in a hypothetical scenario where `hmp` had more keys, the next key would be the next item in the dictionary order. But given the current state, the loop will not proceed further.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will not proceed further, we do not need to change the values of `i`, `p`, `ans`, or `hmp` because the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 4 * `m` + (`m` - `hmp`['F']), and `hmp` is a dictionary with key 'F' mapped to `m`**
