Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in hmp:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `hmp`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are keys in the dictionary `hmp`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 'F'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEF'
   - `ans` is 4 * `m`
   - `hmp` is an empty dictionary

4. **Check the Dictionary `hmp`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `hmp` is an empty dictionary.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `hmp` must contain at least one key.
   - Since `i` was 'F' in the previous iteration, it means 'F' was a key in `hmp` before the loop started.
   - After the previous iteration, `hmp` became empty, so the loop condition is no longer met.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be the next key in `hmp` if it exists. Since `hmp` is now empty, there is no next key.
   - `p` remains 'ABCDEF'.
   - `ans` remains 4 * `m`.
   - `hmp` remains an empty dictionary.

Since the loop cannot execute again because `hmp` is empty, the state does not change from the current state.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 4 * `m`, and `hmp` is an empty dictionary**
