Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `v1` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is an input string from the user**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 3) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v1` is now 3, while `i`, `n`, and `v2` retain their original values, and `r` remains an input string from the user.
