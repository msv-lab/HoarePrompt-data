Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 10^4) and implicitly a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \). For each test case, the function queries the user for comparisons between pairs of indices and updates values based on the user's responses. Finally, the function outputs a pair of indices, either indicating a specific value or an error if the input is invalid.**
