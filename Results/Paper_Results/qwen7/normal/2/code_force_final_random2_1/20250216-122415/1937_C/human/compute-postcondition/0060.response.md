Output State: **`min_index` is `i`, `i` is the next element in `min_indices`, `max_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, `res` is the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`**

Explanation: The line `min_index = i` updates the value of `min_index` to be equal to `i`. The other variables (`i`, `max_index`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
