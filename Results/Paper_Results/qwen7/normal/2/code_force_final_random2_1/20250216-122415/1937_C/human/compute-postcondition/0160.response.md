Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string from the user, `v1` remains unchanged as `n-1`, and `prev` is 2 if `r` equals `'>'`; otherwise, `prev` remains 1.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the terminal. Since no variables are modified or their values changed by this operation, the initial state remains unchanged.
