Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`: This implies that `i` is incremented by 1 from whatever its previous value was.
- `prev` is `n-1`: `prev` is set to `n-1`, where `n` is an input integer.
- `n` is an input integer: This means `n` is some integer value provided as input.
- `r` is the input string: This means `r` is a string provided as input.
- `g` is 0: `g` is initialized to 0.
- `kp` is 1: `kp` is initialized to 1.
- `v1` is `i + 2`: `v1` is set to the value of `i` plus 2.
- `v2` is `i`: `v2` is set to the current value of `i`.

Given these definitions, let's determine the values of `v1` and `v2` when the print statement is executed:

- Since `i` is `i + 1`, `v2` will be the new value of `i`.
- `v1` is `i + 2`, so it will be the new value of `i` plus 2.

Therefore, when the print statement `print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')` is executed, it will print the following:

Output: **? [i + 2] [i + 2] [i] [i]**
