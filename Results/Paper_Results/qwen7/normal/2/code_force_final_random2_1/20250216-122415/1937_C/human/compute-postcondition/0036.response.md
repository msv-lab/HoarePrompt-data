Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `min_indices` is a list.
- If `res` equals '<', then `min_indices` contains `n` twice.
- Otherwise, `min_indices` contains `max_index`, the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n)`, and `n`.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.
   - There are no other variables directly modified within the loop head.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than `n`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` should be set to `n-1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop.

### New State:
- `min_indices` remains the same as it is not directly modified by the loop head.
- `i` is set to `n-1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`min_indices` is a list. If `res` equals '<', then `min_indices` contains `n` twice. Otherwise, `min_indices` contains `max_index`, the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, n)`, and `n`. `i` is `n-1`**.
