Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in min_indices:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `min_indices`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be a valid index within `min_indices`. This means `i` should be one of the elements in `min_indices`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `min_index` is equal to `i`
   - `i` is equal to `max_index`
   - `res` is the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, which is currently `'='`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is now the current element being iterated over, it will be the next `min_index`.
   - `i` will be incremented or moved to the next element in `min_indices`.
   - `max_index` will be updated to the new value of `i`.
   - `res` will be updated to the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` with the new values of `min_index` and `i`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `min_index` will be the next element in `min_indices`.
   - `i` will be the next element in `min_indices`.
   - `max_index` will be the same as `i` (since `i` is set to `max_index` at the end of each iteration).
   - `res` will be the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` with the new values.

Given the current state where `i` is equal to `max_index` and `min_index`, and `res` is `'='`, the next state will be:

- `min_index` will be the next element in `min_indices`.
- `i` will be the next element in `min_indices`.
- `max_index` will be the next element in `min_indices`.
- `res` will be the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` with the new values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`min_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, `i` is the next element in `min_indices`, `max_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, and `res` is the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`**.
