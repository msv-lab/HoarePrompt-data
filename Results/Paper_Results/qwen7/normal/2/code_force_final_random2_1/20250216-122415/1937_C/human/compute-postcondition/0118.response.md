Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will start from `i = 1` and go up to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range function starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Adjust the given states**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`, but the loop starts with `i = 1`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to `1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider other variables**:
   - `r`, `prev`, `g`, and `v1` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute. They can remain as they are.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to `1` and `n` to be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
