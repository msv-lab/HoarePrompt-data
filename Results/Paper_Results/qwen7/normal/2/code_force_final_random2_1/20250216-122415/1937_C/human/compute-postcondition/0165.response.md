Output State: **i is n, n is greater than 3, v2 is n-1, r is the input from the user, v1 remains unchanged as n-1, and prev is n-1 if 'r' equals '>'; otherwise, prev remains 1.**

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and must be greater than 3 since the loop requires at least 3 iterations to complete. The variable `v2` remains `n-1` as it was initialized and has not been altered within the loop. The variable `r` will hold the value entered by the user on the last iteration or subsequent interactions outside the loop. The variable `v1` remains unchanged as `n-1` because it is not modified within the loop. Finally, the variable `prev` will be `n-1` if the user entered `'>'` on the last iteration, indicating that `prev` was updated to the current value of `i` (which is `n-1`), or it will remain `1` if the user did not enter `'>'` on the last iteration.
