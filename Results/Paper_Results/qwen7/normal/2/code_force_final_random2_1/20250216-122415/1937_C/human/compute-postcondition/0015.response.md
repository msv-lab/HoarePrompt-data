Output State: **`res` is the result of calling `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`, `max_index` is now equal to `i`, `i` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `max_index = i` updates the value of `max_index` to be equal to the current value of `i`. The initial state of `res` and `i` remains unchanged.
