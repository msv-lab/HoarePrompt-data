Output State: **`min_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, `i` is the next element in `min_indices`, `max_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, `res` is the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by calling the function `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`. The values of `min_index`, `i`, and `max_index` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `res` is now the return value of the function call, but since the function itself is not defined, we cannot specify what the exact value of `res` is. However, we know that `res` is the return value of the function call, and the other variables retain their previous states.
