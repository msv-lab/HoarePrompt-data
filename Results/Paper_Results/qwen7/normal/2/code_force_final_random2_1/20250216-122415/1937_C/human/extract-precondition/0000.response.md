Precondition: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4.**

This precondition is derived from the fact that the input `n` represents the length of the permutation, and it is constrained within the specified range. The function `func_3` interacts with an external mechanism to determine the permutation and find the indices `i` and `j` that maximize the bitwise XOR operation, adhering to the query limit of 3n.
