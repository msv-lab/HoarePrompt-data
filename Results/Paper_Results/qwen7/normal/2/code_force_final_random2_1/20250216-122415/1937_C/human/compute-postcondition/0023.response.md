State: **`min_indices` is a list containing the value of `max_index`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0, so it needs to be set to 0.
- The loop condition `range(0, n)` requires `n` to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The state of `min_indices` does not affect the loop's execution, so it remains as given.
