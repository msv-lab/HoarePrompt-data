### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` is used to query the jury with indices `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and returns the result of the comparison.
   - `func_2` is used to provide the final answer with indices `i` and `j`.
   - `func_3` initializes the process by reading `n` and handling the special case when `n == 2`.

2. **Handling the Special Case (`n == 2`)**:
   - For `n == 2`, the program directly calls `func_2(0, 1)`, which is correct because the maximum XOR for a permutation of `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]` is `1`.

3. **Main Logic for General Case (`n > 2`)**:
   - The program aims to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized.
   - It starts by finding an index `max_index` such that `(p_0 | p_{max_index})` is maximized compared to `(p_0 | p_i)` for all `i`. This is done by querying the jury with `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` for all `i`.
   - After identifying `max_index`, it tries to find the smallest index `min_index` from the set of indices where `(p_{max_index} | p_{min_index})` is not less than `(p_{max_index} | p_i)` for all `i`. This is done by querying the jury with `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` for all `i` in `min_indices`.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach is logically sound. By finding `max_index` and then `min_index`, the program ensures that the maximum XOR is achieved.
   - The use of `func_1` to compare `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)` is consistent with the problem's requirements.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and the number of queries.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program correctly handles the special case when `n == 2`.
   - The loop in `func_3` iterates `n` times, ensuring that all necessary comparisons are made.
   - The program flushes the output after each query and answer, adhering to the interaction protocol.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem's specifications.

### Correctness:
**True**
