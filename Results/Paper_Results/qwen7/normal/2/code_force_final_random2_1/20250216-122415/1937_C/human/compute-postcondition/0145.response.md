Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string from the user, `v1` remains unchanged as `n-1`, `prev` is 0**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or affect the state of the variables. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are modified, the initial state remains unchanged.
