Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is an input from the user, and `prev` is unchanged unless '>', in which case `prev` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `r = input()` assigns the value entered by the user to the variable `r`. The initial state of `i` and `n` remains unchanged, and the value of `r` is updated to the input provided by the user. The condition for `prev` being set to 1 based on the initial state is not directly affected by this line of code unless the user inputs '>'.
