Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the input from the user, `v1` remains unchanged as `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1` if `r` equals `'>';` otherwise, `prev` remains 1, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values but ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
