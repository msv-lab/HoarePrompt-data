Output State: **i is n, n must be greater than 2, v2 is n-1, r is an input string from the user, and the value of v1 remains unchanged as n-1.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the input integer `n`. The variable `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to run completely. The variable `v2` will be equal to `n-1`, and `r` will be the input string received from the user during the last iteration of the loop. The value of `v1` remains unchanged and is equal to `n-1`.
