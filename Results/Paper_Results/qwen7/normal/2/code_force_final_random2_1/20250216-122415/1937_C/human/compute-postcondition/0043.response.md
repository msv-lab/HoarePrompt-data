Output State: `min_indices` is a list that contains either `max_index` and all integers from `0` to `n-1` if `res` was not `'<'` in any iteration, or just the last integer `n-1` if `res` was `'<'` in all iterations.

To break this down further:
- The loop runs `n` times, iterating over each index from `0` to `n-1`.
- In each iteration, `res` is determined by calling `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`.
- If `res` is `<`, `min_indices` is reset to contain only the current index `i`.
- If `res` is not `<`, the current index `i` is appended to `min_indices`.

After all iterations, `min_indices` will either contain a single element `n-1` if `res` was always `<`, or it will contain `max_index` followed by all integers from `0` to `n-1` if `res` was not `<` in any iteration.
