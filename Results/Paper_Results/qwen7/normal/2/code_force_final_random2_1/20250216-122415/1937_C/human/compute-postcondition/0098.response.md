Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `r` is an input string
   - If `r` equals '>', then `prev` is set to 1

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (to 2) and `n` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1.

6. **Consider other variables**:
   - `r` and `prev` are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition. Therefore, they remain as they were.

Based on this reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is an input string, and if `r` equals '>', then `prev` is set to 1**.
