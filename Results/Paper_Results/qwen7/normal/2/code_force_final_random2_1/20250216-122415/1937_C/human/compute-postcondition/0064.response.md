Output State: **`min_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, `i` is the next element in `min_indices`, `max_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, and `res` is the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `min_index`, `i`, `max_index`, or `res`, these variables retain their previous values.
