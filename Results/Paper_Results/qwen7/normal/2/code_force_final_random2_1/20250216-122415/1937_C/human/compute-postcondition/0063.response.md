Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `min_indices`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is an element of `min_indices`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `min_index` is `i`
   - `i` is the next element in `min_indices`
   - `max_index` is the next element in `min_indices`
   - `res` is the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `min_indices`, the loop will continue if `i` is still within `min_indices`.
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be updated to the next element in `min_indices`.
   - `min_index` will now be set to the new value of `i`.
   - `max_index` will also be updated to the next element in `min_indices`.
   - `res` will be updated to the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` with the new values.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to the next element in `min_indices`.
   - `min_index` will be updated to the new value of `i`.
   - `max_index` will be updated to the next element in `min_indices`.
   - `res` will be updated to the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` with the new values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`min_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, `i` is the next element in `min_indices`, `max_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, and `res` is the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`**.
