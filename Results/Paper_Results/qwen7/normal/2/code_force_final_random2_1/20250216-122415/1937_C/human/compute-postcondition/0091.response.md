Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `i` is explicitly given as 1, so we know its value. However, the values of `v1` and `prev` are not provided in the initial state. Since these values are not defined, we cannot determine their exact values.

Given the format and the information available, the output will include placeholders for `v1` and `prev`.

Output: **'? [v1] 1 [v1] [prev]'**
