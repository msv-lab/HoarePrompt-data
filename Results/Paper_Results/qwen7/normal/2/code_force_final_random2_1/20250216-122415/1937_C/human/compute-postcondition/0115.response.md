Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `r` equals '>', `prev` is equal to `n-1`**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to the original value of `n`. The variable `r` and `prev` retain their original values. Since the initial state mentions that `n` must be greater than 2, this condition is preserved.
