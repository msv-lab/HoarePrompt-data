Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is an input from the user, and `prev` is 2 if `r` equals '>', otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It simply flushes the output buffer. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states.
