Output State: **`min_indices` is a list that contains either `max_index` and all integers from `0` to `n-1` if `res` was not `'<'` in any iteration, or just the last integer `n-1` if `res` was `'<'` in all iterations; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the first element of the `min_indices` list to the variable `min_index`. This does not change the content of `min_indices` itself. Therefore, the list `min_indices` remains as it was after the loop, which depends on the condition of `res` being `<` in all iterations or not. The variable `min_index` now holds the value of the first element in `min_indices`.
