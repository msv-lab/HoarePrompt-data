Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `v1` is 2 (not part of the loop head)
   - `v2` is 2 (not part of the loop head)
   - `r` is an input string from the user (not part of the loop head)

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**
