You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4.
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    if (n == 2) :
        func_2(0, 1)
        return
        #The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.
    #State: `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        res = func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)
        
        if res == '<':
            max_index = i
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `max_index` will be equal to `n-1` if for every `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'. Otherwise, `max_index` will be the largest `i` such that `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<'.
    min_indices = [max_index]
    for i in range(0, n):
        res = func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)
        
        if res == '<':
            min_indices = [i]
        else:
            min_indices.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `min_indices` is a list that contains either `max_index` and all integers from `0` to `n-1` if `res` was not `'<'` in any iteration, or just the last integer `n-1` if `res` was `'<'` in all iterations.
    #
    #To break this down further:
    #- The loop runs `n` times, iterating over each index from `0` to `n-1`.
    #- In each iteration, `res` is determined by calling `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`.
    #- If `res` is `<`, `min_indices` is reset to contain only the current index `i`.
    #- If `res` is not `<`, the current index `i` is appended to `min_indices`.
    #
    #After all iterations, `min_indices` will either contain a single element `n-1` if `res` was always `<`, or it will contain `max_index` followed by all integers from `0` to `n-1` if `res` was not `<` in any iteration.
    min_index = min_indices[0]
    for i in min_indices:
        if i == max_index:
            continue
        
        res = func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)
        
        if res == '=':
            min_index = i
        
    #State: min_index is the last element in min_indices.
    func_2(max_index, min_index)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
