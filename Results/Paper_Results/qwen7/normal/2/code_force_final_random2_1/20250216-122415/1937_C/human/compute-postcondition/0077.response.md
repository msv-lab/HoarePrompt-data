Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `prev` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is the input string, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `i + 1`, `v2` is `i`**.

Explanation: The code `r = input('')` assigns the user's input to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `i` is already updated to `i + 1` before this line of code, and `prev` is set to `n-1`. The other variables (`g`, `kp`, `v1`, and `v2`) retain their original values.
