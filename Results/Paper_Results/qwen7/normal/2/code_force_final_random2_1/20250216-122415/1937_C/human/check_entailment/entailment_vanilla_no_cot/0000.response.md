Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical flaws and inefficiencies:

1. **Incorrect Query Strategy**: The function `func_3` uses a suboptimal strategy for finding the maximum XOR. It starts by identifying the index with the highest OR value when paired with 0, but it doesn't ensure that the selected indices maximize the XOR. The approach to find the minimum indices and then the minimum index among them is flawed and does not guarantee the maximum XOR.

2. **Query Limit**: The program is expected to make at most \(3n\) queries, but the current implementation might exceed this limit due to its inefficient approach.

3. **Handling Small Permutations**: For \(n = 2\), the program directly outputs the indices without querying, which is correct. However, the general approach for larger \(n\) is not robust enough.

4. **Lack of Detailed Logic**: The logic to determine the maximum XOR is not well-defined. The program should systematically explore pairs to find the maximum XOR, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

### Suggested Approach:
A more effective strategy involves using a divide-and-conquer approach or leveraging properties of XOR and OR operations to efficiently find the maximum XOR. Here's a high-level outline of a better approach:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Divide the array into smaller segments and use the results of previous queries to narrow down the indices that could potentially give the maximum XOR.
2. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to efficiently find the indices that maximize the XOR.
3. **Pairwise Comparison**: Systematically compare pairs of indices to ensure the maximum XOR is found within the allowed query limit.

Given these points, the provided solution is not correct and needs significant improvements to meet the problem requirements.
