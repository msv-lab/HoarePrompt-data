### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can query the result of \((p_a \mid p_b)\) vs \((p_c \mid p_d)\) up to \(3n\) times.
   - The goal is to find the pair with the maximum XOR value.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` is used to ask a query and get the result.
   - `func_2` is used to provide the final answer.
   - `func_3` is the main function that implements the logic to find the indices.

3. **Main Logic in `func_3`:**
   - For \(n = 2\), it directly outputs the indices \(0\) and \(1\).
   - For \(n > 2\):
     - It initializes `max_index` to \(0\) and finds the index with the highest bitwise OR value when paired with \(0\).
     - It then identifies the minimum index among those with the same OR value as `max_index`.
     - Finally, it determines the index with the highest XOR value when paired with `min_index`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic to find `max_index` works correctly by querying the OR values.
   - The logic to find `min_indices` and `min_index` seems flawed. It assumes that the minimum OR value among the candidates will lead to the maximum XOR, which is not necessarily true.
   - The XOR calculation and selection process might not guarantee finding the optimal pair.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider a permutation like \([0, 1, 2, 3]\):
     - `max_index` will be \(3\) (since \(3 \mid 3 = 3\)).
     - `min_indices` will include indices \(0, 1, 2, 3\).
     - The final `min_index` might not be the correct choice for maximizing XOR.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in `func_3` does not guarantee finding the pair with the maximum XOR value due to the flawed approach in determining `min_index`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because the logic to find the indices with the maximum XOR value is flawed.
