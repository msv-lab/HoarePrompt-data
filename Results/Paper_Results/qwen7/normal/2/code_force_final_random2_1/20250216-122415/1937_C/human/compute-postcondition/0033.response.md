Output State: **`min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`, the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, and `i`; `i` is `n`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is `n`) to the list `min_indices`. The list initially contains `max_index` and the value returned by `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`. After appending `i`, the list now includes `max_index`, the value returned by the function call, and the current value of `i`, which is `n`.
