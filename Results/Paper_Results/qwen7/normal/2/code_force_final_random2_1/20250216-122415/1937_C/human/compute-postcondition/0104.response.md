Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `r` is an input from the user.
   - `prev` is 2 if `r` equals '>'; otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 1 up to but not including `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, so the loop can continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged, but it must still be greater than 1.
   - The value of `r` and `prev` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Construct the New State**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `r` and `prev` remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is an input from the user, and `prev` is 2 if `r` equals '>'; otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged**.
