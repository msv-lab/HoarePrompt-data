Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `v2` is 1 (this variable is not in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `r` remains unchanged or is set to '<' (this variable is not in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
