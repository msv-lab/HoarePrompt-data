Output State: **`min_indices` is a list containing the value of `max_index`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `min_indices` as a list containing the value of `max_index`. The value of `max_index` is determined by the condition described in the initial state, but the code itself does not change its value. Therefore, `min_indices` is simply a list with one element, which is the value of `max_index`.
