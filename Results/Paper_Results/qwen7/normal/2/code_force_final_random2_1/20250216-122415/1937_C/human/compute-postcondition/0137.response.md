Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `v2` is 3**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means it ensures that any buffered data is written out immediately. Since no variables are updated or affected by this operation, the values of `i`, `n`, and `v2` remain unchanged.
