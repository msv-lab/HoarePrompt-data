Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `prev` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is the string "<", `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `i + 1`, `v2` is `i`**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously printed content is displayed immediately. Since no variables are modified, their previous values remain unchanged.
