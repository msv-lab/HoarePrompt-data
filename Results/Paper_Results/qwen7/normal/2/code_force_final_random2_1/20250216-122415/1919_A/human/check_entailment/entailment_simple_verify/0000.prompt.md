You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be a positive integer less than or equal to 1000, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9. The values of `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input during the loop's execution. For each iteration of the loop, if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the output was "Bob". If the absolute difference is odd, the output was "Alice". The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution, and `i` increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `t-1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic. According to the problem description, the winner is determined by whether the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd after all possible moves. However, the program incorrectly checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd and decides the winner based on that condition alone.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 4`
- Expected Output: `Alice`

According to the game rules, let's analyze the game:
1. Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with 4 coins.
2. Alice can either swap wallets or remove a coin from her wallet.
   - If Alice removes a coin, she now has 0 coins, and Bob still has 4 coins.
   - Bob then removes a coin, leaving him with 3 coins and Alice with 0 coins.
   - Alice again removes a coin, leaving her with 0 coins and Bob with 3 coins.
   - Bob removes a coin, leaving him with 2 coins and Alice with 0 coins.
   - Alice removes a coin, leaving her with 0 coins and Bob with 2 coins.
   - Bob removes a coin, leaving him with 1 coin and Alice with 0 coins.
   - Alice removes a coin, leaving her with 0 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
   - Bob removes a coin, leaving him with 0 coins and Alice with 0 coins.

Since both players end up with 0 coins, Alice makes the last move and wins. However, the program incorrectly prints "Bob" because the absolute difference between 1 and 4 is 3, which is odd, leading the program to print "Alice".

Thus, the program does not handle the game logic correctly, and the output is incorrect for the given test case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
