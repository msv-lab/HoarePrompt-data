Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not needed to determine the output).
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `a` and `b` are input integers, but their specific values are not provided and do not affect the output of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Bob'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **'Bob'**
