Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0 and `i` is still 0. The input integers are stored in `a` and `b`.
