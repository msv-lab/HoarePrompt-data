You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be a positive integer less than or equal to 1000, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9. The values of `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input during the loop's execution. For each iteration of the loop, if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the output was "Bob". If the absolute difference is odd, the output was "Alice". The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution, and `i` increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `t-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it determines whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints either "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b` for each case.

2. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even using the condition `if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Bob".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

3. **Game Logic:**
   - The key observation here is that the game essentially boils down to determining who will be the last player to make a move.
   - If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, then Bob can always mirror Alice's moves to ensure he is the one to make the last move.
   - Conversely, if the absolute difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even difference, ensuring she is the one to make the last move.

### Verification

Given the problem statement and the analysis of the game logic, the provided program correctly implements the solution. The logic is sound and matches the winning conditions derived from the game rules.
