Output State: `t` must be a positive integer less than or equal to 1000, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9. The values of `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input during the loop's execution. For each iteration of the loop, if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the output was "Bob". If the absolute difference is odd, the output was "Alice". The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution, and `i` increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `t-1`.
