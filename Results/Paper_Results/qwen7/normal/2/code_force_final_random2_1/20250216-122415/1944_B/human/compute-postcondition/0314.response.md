Output State: **`k` is equal to 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `k` and `i`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no new assignments or changes to `k` or `i` are made, their values remain the same as the initial state.
