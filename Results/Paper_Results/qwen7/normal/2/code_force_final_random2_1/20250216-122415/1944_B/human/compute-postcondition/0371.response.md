Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 5000), an array \( a \) of length 2\( n \) where each integer from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly twice, and two integers \( n \) and \( k \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 5 × 10^4, 1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ ⌊\( n \)/2⌋). For each test case, it splits the array \( a \) into two halves, sorts them, and then constructs two lists, \( ans1 \) and \( ans2 \), by selecting specific elements from the sorted halves and the original array. Finally, it prints these two lists. The function ensures that \( ans1 \) and \( ans2 \) contain all necessary elements from the original array and the sorted halves, adhering to the constraints on \( k \).**
