Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is -4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
