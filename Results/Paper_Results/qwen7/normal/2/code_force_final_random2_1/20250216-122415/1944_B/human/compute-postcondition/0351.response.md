Output State: **`k` is equal to -1, `i` is equal to `n`, `len(l)` must be at least `n`, `ans2` contains the element `l[i]`, `ans1` contains the element `l[i]`**.

The value of `k` is decremented by 1, making it `-1`. The values of `i`, `len(l)`, `ans2`, and `ans1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
