Postcondition: `k` is an integer. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is decremented by 2, `ans2` is a list that now includes `c[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` was equal to 0 before the execution. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, then no changes are made to `k` and `ans2`.
