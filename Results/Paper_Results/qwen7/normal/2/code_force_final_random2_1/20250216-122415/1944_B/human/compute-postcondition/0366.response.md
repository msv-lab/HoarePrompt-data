Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k = req - 2 * (n - 1)`
   - `i = n + len(l) - 1`
   - `len(l) >= n`
   - `ans2` contains elements from `l[n]` to `l[len(l) - 1]` if they are equal to their preceding elements.
   - `ans1` contains the same elements as `ans2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(*ans1)`

From the initial state, we know that `ans1` and `ans2` contain the same elements. These elements are taken from the list `l` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, but only if those elements are equal to their preceding elements in the list.

Given this information, the print statement will output the elements of `ans1`, which are the elements from `l[n]` to `l[len(l) - 1]` that satisfy the condition of being equal to their preceding elements.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of `ans1`, which are the elements from `l[n]` to `l[len(l) - 1]` that meet the specified condition.

Output: **the elements of ans1 (which are the elements from l[n] to l[len(l) - 1] that are equal to their preceding elements)**
