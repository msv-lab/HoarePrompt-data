Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is -4, and `ans2` has the element `c[3]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `c[3]` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 3, the element `c[3]` is appended. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be at least 3 also remains valid.
