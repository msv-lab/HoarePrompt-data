Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, the first element of `b` is not equal to the second element of `b`, `c` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order starting from index `n` of list `a`, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of list `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to the original value of `k`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends the last element of list `b` to the list `ans1`. Since `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and the first element is not equal to the second element, the last element of `b` is appended to `ans1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
