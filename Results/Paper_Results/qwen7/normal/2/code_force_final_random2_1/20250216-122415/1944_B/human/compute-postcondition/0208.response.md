Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `k` is either -2 or 0; `ans2` now contains the element `c[i]` appended to it.**

The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is at least 2, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `k` is either -2 or 0, these conditions remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans2` now includes the element `c[i]` appended to its previous contents.
