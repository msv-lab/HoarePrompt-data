Output State: **`i` is 2, the length of list `l` is either 1 or 2, and `k` equals 0; `ans1` is a list with the element `b[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans1` will now contain the element `b[2]`. The other variables (`l` and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
