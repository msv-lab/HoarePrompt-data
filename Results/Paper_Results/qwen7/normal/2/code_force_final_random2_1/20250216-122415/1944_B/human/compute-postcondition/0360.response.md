Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `len(l)` must be at least `n + 2`, `ans2` contains the elements `l[n + 1]` and the element appended from `l[i]`, `ans1` appends the element `l[n + 1]` to itself, and the loop breaks out of the iteration if `k` equals 0.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop. Since the initial condition was that the loop breaks out of the iteration if `k` equals 0, after executing the `break` statement, `k` is set to 0. The values of `i`, `len(l)`, `ans2`, and `ans1` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them within the code snippet.
