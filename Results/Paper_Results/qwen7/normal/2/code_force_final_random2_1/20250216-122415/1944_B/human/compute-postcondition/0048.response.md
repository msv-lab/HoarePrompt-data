Output State: **`k` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `ans1` contains `b[i]`, and no changes are made to `b[i]` or `l` based on the given conditions.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since the initial state mentions that `k` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now `i + 1`), and `n` remains the same, these values remain unchanged. The condition checks are not explicitly provided, but since no changes are mentioned if `k` is 0, the only action taken is appending `b[i]` to `ans1`.
