Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of list `l`.
- `k` is -2 times the number of consecutive pairs found.
- `ans1` contains all elements of list `l`.
- `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive identical elements found in list `l`.

The `print(*ans2)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans2` separated by spaces.

To understand what `ans2` contains, let's break it down:

- `ans2` is constructed during the iteration over the list `l` to find pairs of consecutive identical elements.
- Each pair of consecutive identical elements is added to `ans2`.

For example, if `l = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4]`, then the consecutive identical pairs would be `(2, 2)`, `(4, 4)`, and `(4, 4)`. Therefore, `ans2` would be `[2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.

Given this, the output of `print(*ans2)` would be the elements of `ans2` printed in a single line separated by spaces.

Output: **2 2 4 4 4 4**
