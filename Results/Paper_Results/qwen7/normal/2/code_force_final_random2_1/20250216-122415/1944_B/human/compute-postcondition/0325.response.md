Output State: **`k` is equal to `req` - 2, `i` is 3, `n` is defined and greater than 1, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` and appends `c[2]`, and the value of `c[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All the initial conditions remain unchanged.
