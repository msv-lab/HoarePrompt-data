Output State: **`k` is `-4 * (len(l) - 1)`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is a list that includes all elements from `l` except the last one, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` has its last element appended with the first element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[0])` appends the first element of `b` to the list `l`. Since `b` is an empty list initially, this operation does not change `b` but adds an element to `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
