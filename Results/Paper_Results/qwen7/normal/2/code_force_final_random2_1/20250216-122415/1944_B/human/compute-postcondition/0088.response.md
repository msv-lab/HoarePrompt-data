Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is -2, `ans2` contains the elements `[c[2], c[2]]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans2` originally contained the element `c[2]`, and now it will contain `[c[2], c[2]]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
