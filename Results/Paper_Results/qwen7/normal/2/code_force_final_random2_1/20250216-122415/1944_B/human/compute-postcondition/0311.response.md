Output State: **`k` is equal to `req`, the loop will terminate when `i` reaches `n-1` or when `k` becomes 0. Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will run exactly `n-2` times if `k` does not become 0 earlier.**

The code `k = req` assigns the value of `req` to `k`. This does not affect the termination condition of the loop, which remains the same as the initial state. The loop will still terminate when `i` reaches `n-1` or when `k` becomes 0. Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will run exactly `n-2` times if `k` does not become 0 earlier.
