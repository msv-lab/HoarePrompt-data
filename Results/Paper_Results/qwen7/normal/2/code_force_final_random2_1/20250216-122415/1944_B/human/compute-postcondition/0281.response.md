Output State: **`i` is 1, the length of list `l` is 2, and `k` equals 0; `l` contains the element `b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 1, `b[1]` is appended to `l`. Since the initial length of `l` was 1 or 2, and one element was already present (as per the precondition), appending another element means the length of `l` is now 2. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
