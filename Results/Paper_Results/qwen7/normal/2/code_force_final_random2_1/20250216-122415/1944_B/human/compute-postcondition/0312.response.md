State: **`k` is equal to `req`, `i` is 1, `n` is defined and must be greater than 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and runs until `i` reaches `n-1`.
2. For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[1, n-1]`.
3. The initial value of `i` is 1, so `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop runs at least once.
4. The condition for the loop to terminate is either `i` reaching `n-1` or `k` becoming 0. Since `k` is initially equal to `req`, we don't need to adjust `k` unless it becomes 0 during the loop execution, but we need to ensure it doesn't become 0 immediately to allow the loop to run at least once.
5. Therefore, the key adjustments needed are ensuring `i` starts at 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `k` is equal to `req`.

Thus, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
