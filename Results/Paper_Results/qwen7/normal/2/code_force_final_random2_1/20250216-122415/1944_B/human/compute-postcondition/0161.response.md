Output State: **`k` is an integer, and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`; currently, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`; `l` now contains the element `b[i]` appended to it.**

In this output state, the variable `k` remains an integer as it was not affected by the code. The condition that `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` still holds true. Additionally, the list `l` has been updated by appending the element `b[i]` to it.
