Output State: **`k` is -3, `ans1` is a list including `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[i_prev+1]`, and `l[i]`, `ans2` is a list including `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[i_prev+1]`, `l[i]` is appended to `ans2`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from -2 to -3. The operations on `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged, so their contents stay the same as they were in the initial state.
