Output State: **`k` is an integer, `i` is now `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, and `ans1` has appended the element `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. The other variables `k`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, as mentioned in the initial state.
