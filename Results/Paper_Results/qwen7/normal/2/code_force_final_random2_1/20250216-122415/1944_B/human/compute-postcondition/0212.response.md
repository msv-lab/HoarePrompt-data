Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Postconditions:**
   - `i` is at least 2.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - The current value of `k` is either -2 or 0.
   - If `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]` and `k` is -2, then `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` appended to it.
   - If `c[i]` does not equal `c[i - 1]`, the value of `k` remains unchanged and `ans2` also remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` was at least 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`, which means `i` will be at least 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant upper limit for the loop.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop changes it, but since no such change is mentioned, `k` still remains either -2 or 0.
   - The conditions for appending to `ans2` depend on the values of `c[i]` and `c[i - 1]`, but these conditions do not affect the loop counter or the upper limit `n`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
**`i` is at least 3, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `k` is either -2 or 0.**
