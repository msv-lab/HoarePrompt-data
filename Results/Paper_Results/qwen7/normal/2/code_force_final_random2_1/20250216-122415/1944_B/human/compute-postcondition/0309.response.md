Postcondition: `i` is 3, the length of list `l` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `k` equals 0. If `b[3]` is equal to `b[2]`, then `k` is set to -2 and `ans1` is a list with the elements `b[3]` and `b[3]`. Otherwise, if `b[3]` is not equal to `b[4]`, the length of list `l` becomes 2. Otherwise, the length of list `l` remains unchanged.
