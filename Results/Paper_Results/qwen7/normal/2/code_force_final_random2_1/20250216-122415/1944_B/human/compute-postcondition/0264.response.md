Output State: **`b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements and sorted, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the last `len(a) - n` elements and now sorted, `i` is equal to the length of list `l`, `k` is -4 * (number of consecutive pairs found) - 2, `ans1` is a list containing the elements `b[n - 1]` and `b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is `len(l) + 1`, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is a list with one element `[b[0]]`, `b[0]` is the first element of the sorted sublist `b`. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `b` has its first element added to list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= 2` decreases the value of `k` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
