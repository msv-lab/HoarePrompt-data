Output State: **`k` is an integer, `i` is now `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, and `ans1` has the additional element `b[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. The other variables (`k`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
