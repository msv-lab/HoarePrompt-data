Output State: **`k` is -1, `ans1` is a list that now includes the elements `l[0]` and `l[1]`, `ans2` is a list that includes the elements `l[0]` and `l[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `k`, `ans1`, and `ans2`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
