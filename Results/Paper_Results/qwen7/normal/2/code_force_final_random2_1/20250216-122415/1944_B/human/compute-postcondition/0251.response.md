Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `l`, `k` is -2 * (number of consecutive pairs found), `ans1` contains all elements of list `l`, `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive identical elements found in list `l`, `q` is `len(l) + 1`, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the last `len(a) - n` elements.**

Explanation: The code `c = a[n:]` assigns a new list `c` which contains the elements of `a` starting from index `n` till the end of the list `a`. The length of `c` is `len(a) - n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
