Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is less than or equal to -2 (specifically, it will be `-2 * (n-1)`), `c[i-1]` is the last element processed, and `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive duplicate elements starting from `c[1]` up to `c[i-2]` if they exist.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has gone through all elements in the list `c`. The variable `k` will be less than or equal to -2, specifically `-2 * (n-1)`, as each iteration decrements `k` by 2. The list `ans2` will contain pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from the start of the list `c` (from index 1 onwards) until the last processed element, unless `k` becomes zero before processing all elements.
