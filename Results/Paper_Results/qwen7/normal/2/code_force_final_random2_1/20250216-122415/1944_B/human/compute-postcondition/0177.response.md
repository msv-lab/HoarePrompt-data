Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, meaning `i` starts at `1` and goes up to `n-2`.
3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by `1` each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
4. **Check the Postcondition**: The postcondition involves the values of `b[i]`, `b[i-1]`, `b[i+1]`, and `b[i+2]`.

Given the postcondition:
- `k` is an integer (remains unchanged).
- `ans1` contains specific elements based on the comparison of `b[i]` and `b[i-1]`.
- `l` contains an element based on the comparison of `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]`.

Since the loop condition is dependent on `i` and `n`, and the postcondition does not directly affect these variables, we only need to adjust `i` and ensure `n` is still valid.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `k` is an integer.
- `ans1` contains elements based on the comparison.
- `l` contains elements based on the comparison.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by `1`, so `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `n` must remain the same as it was at the start of the current iteration.

Therefore, the state adjustments are:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

So, the updated state is:
State: **`k` is an integer, `ans1` contains the elements `[b[i + 1], b[i + 1]]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged and if `b[i + 1]` is not equal to `b[i + 2]`, `l` contains the element `b[i + 1]` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
