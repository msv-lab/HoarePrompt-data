Postcondition: `k` is `-4 * (len(l) - 1)`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is a list that includes all elements from `l` except the last one, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, and `l` now has its last element appended with the first element of `b`, unless `b[0]` is equal to `b[1]`, in which case no changes are made to `l`. If `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, then `k` remains unchanged, `ans1` remains empty, `ans2` remains the same as all elements from `l` except the last one, and `l` is modified as described. If `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`, then `k` becomes `-4 * (len(l) - 1) - 2`, `ans1` becomes a list containing the elements `b[n - 1]` and `b[n - 1]`, and `l` is modified as described.
