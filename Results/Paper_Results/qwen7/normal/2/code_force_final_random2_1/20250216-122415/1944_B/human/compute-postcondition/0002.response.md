Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0 and must be less than `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial values of `t` and `q` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer between 1 and 5000, and `q` is still 0 and must be less than `t`. The new variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values read from the input.
