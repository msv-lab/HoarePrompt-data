Output State: **`k` is `-4 * (len(l) - 1) - 2`, `ans1` is a list containing the elements `b[n - 1]` and `b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is a list that includes all elements from `l` except the last one, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, and `l` has its last element appended with the first element of `b`, unless `b[0]` is equal to `b[1]`, in which case no changes are made to `l`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 2, making it `-4 * (len(l) - 1) - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
