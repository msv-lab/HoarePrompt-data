Postcondition: `k` is an integer. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is decremented by 2, `ans2` is a list that now includes `c[i]`, and if `k` was equal to 0 before the execution, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, then nothing changes.
