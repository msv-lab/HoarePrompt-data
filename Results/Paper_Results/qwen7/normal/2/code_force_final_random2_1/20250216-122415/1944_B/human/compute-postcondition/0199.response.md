Output State: **`i` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `k` is 0; `ans2` contains the value of `c[i]` and appends `c[i]` to itself.**

This means that `ans2` now contains the original value of `c[i]` plus `c[i]` appended to the list. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
