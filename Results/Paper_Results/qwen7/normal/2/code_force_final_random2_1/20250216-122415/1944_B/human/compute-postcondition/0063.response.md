Output State: **`k` is an integer, `i` is now `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, and `l` has appended the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `l`. The values of `k`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. We also note that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, which was mentioned in the initial state.
