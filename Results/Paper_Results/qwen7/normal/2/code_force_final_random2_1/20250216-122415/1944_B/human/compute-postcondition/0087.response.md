Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is -2, `ans2` contains the element `c[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `c` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans2` will now contain the element `c[2]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
