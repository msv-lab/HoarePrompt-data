Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the range of `len(l)`, meaning `i` will take values from `0` to `len(l) - 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is equal to -1
   - `i` is equal to `n`
   - `len(l)` must be at least `n`
   - `ans2` contains the element `l[i]`
   - `ans1` contains the element `l[i]`

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` was equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1` if the loop continues.

5. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(l)`. Given that `i` is now `n + 1`, the loop will continue as long as `n + 1 < len(l)`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `k` remains unchanged at -1.
   - `i` changes to `n + 1`.
   - `len(l)` remains unchanged and must still be at least `n`.
   - `ans2` and `ans1` will contain the element `l[i]`, which is now `l[n + 1]`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `k` is equal to -1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `len(l)` must be at least `n`, `ans2` contains the element `l[n + 1]`, `ans1` contains the element `l[n + 1]`**
