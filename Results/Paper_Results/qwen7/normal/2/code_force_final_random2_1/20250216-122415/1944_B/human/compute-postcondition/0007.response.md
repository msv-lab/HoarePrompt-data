Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order starting from index `n` of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `c.sort()` sorts the list `c` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The list `c` is updated to be sorted.
