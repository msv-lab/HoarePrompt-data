You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. Additionally, an array a of length 2n is given, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.

        k = req
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if k == 0:
                break
            if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
                ans2.append(c[i])
                ans2.append(c[i])
                k -= 2
        
        for i in range(len(l)):
            if k == 0:
                break
            ans1.append(l[i])
            ans2.append(l[i])
            k -= 1
        
        print(*ans1)
        
        print(*ans2)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n + len(l)`, `k` is equal to `req - 2 * (2n - len(l) - 1)`, `ans1` contains all elements from the original list `l` and all pairs of consecutive identical elements found in the lists `b` and `c`, and `ans2` contains the same elements as `ans1`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the total length of the list `l` plus `n`, indicating that the loop has processed every element in both the list `l` and the original lists `b` and `c`. The variable `k` will be equal to `req` minus twice the number of consecutive pairs found in the lists `b` and `c`, which is `2n - len(l) - 1`. The list `ans1` will contain all elements from the original list `l` and all pairs of consecutive identical elements found in the lists `b` and `c`. Similarly, the list `ans2` will contain the same elements as `ans1` since `ans1` and `ans2` append the same elements from `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by three components: a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), an array a of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4, 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋). For each test case, it returns information based on the given inputs.
