Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `b = a[:n]` creates a new list `b` that contains the first `n` elements from the list `a`. The values of `t`, `q`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
