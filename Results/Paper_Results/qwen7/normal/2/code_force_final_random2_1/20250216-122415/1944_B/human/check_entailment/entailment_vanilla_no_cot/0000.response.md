Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Sorting and Subset Selection**: The code sorts `b` and `c`, which is unnecessary and might disrupt the original distribution of numbers, leading to incorrect results. The problem doesn't require sorting to solve.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing `l` and `r`**: The logic for constructing the lists `ans1` and `ans2` is flawed. Specifically, the way it handles duplicates and ensures the XOR condition is not correctly implemented. For example, the code does not ensure that the XOR of `ans1` and `ans2` will be equal.

3. **Handling Duplicates**: The code does not properly handle duplicates in a way that guarantees the XOR condition. It simply appends elements to `ans1` and `ans2` without ensuring the XOR condition is met.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases well, such as when `n` is small or when the input distribution is not balanced.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to use a more robust approach, possibly involving a greedy algorithm or a more detailed analysis of the XOR properties of the numbers. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each number
        count = {}
        for num in a:
            if num in count:
                count[num] += 1
            else:
                count[num] = 1
        
        # Initialize result arrays
        ans1 = []
        ans2 = []
        
        # Iterate through the counts and construct the arrays
        for num in sorted(count.keys()):
            while count[num] > 1 and len(ans1) < 2 * k:
                ans1.append(num)
                ans2.append(num)
                count[num] -= 2
        
        # Ensure the length of ans1 and ans2 is exactly 2k
        while len(ans1) < 2 * k:
            for num in sorted(count.keys()):
                if count[num] > 0:
                    ans1.append(num)
                    ans2.append(num)
                    count[num] -= 1
                    break
        
        print(*ans1)
        print(*ans2)

func()
```

This solution constructs the arrays `ans1` and `ans2` by ensuring that the XOR of their elements is equal. It uses a dictionary to count occurrences of each number and then constructs the arrays by appending pairs of the same number until the required length is achieved.
