Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order starting from index `n` of list `a`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**

The value of `k` is updated to be twice its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
