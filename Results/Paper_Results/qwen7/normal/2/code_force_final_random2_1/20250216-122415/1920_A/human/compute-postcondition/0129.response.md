Output State: **`no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `x` and `a`. The other variables (`no`, `num`, `big`, `less`, `iterable2`) remain unchanged.
