Output State: **`no` is a list, `less` contains the value 2, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer converted to an integer, `a` is an input integer converted to an integer, `less` now contains the value `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `less`. Initially, `less` either contains the value 2 or is an empty list. After appending `a`, `less` will contain both 2 and `a` if it was initially empty, or it will simply add `a` to its existing contents if it already contained 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
