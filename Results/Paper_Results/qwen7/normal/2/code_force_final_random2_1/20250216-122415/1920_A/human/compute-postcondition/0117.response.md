Output State: **`no` is a non-empty list with the first element removed, `i` is the second element of the updated `no`, `num` is decremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `num -= 1` decrements the value of `num` by 1. The initial state indicates that `no` is a non-empty list with the first element removed, `i` is the second element of the updated `no`, and `num` is decremented by 1. After executing the code, `num` is decreased by 1, but the nature of `no` and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
