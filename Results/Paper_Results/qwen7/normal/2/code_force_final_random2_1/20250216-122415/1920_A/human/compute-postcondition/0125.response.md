Output State: **`no` is an empty list, `num` is less than or equal to its initial value minus the length of the original `no` list, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `iterable` is one more than it was at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `no = []` simply reassigns the variable `no` to an empty list. This does not affect the values of `num`, `big`, `less`, or `iterable`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged except for `iterable`, which is incremented by 1 due to the condition mentioned in the initial state.
