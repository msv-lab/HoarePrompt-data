Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `no` is a list containing all elements `a` provided for each iteration of the loop, `num` is 0, `big` is a list containing all elements `a` where `x` is 1, `less` is a list containing all elements `a` where `x` is 2, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and the loop continues.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `i` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, if it was within the range defined by the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`, then `i` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged. `no`, `less`, and `big` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next value from the list `no`, `no` remains unchanged, `less` remains unchanged, `big` remains unchanged. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not change the values of `i`, `no`, `less`, and `big`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
