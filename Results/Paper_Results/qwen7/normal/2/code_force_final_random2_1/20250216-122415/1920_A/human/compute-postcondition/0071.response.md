Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `iterable2`: This is the loop variable that will take values from `range(innerLoop)`.
   - `innerLoop`: This is the parameter that defines the range of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `no` is an empty list.
   - `less` is an empty list.
   - `num` is 0.
   - `big` is an empty list.
   - `innerLoop` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `innerLoop` is a positive integer (greater than 0).

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `innerLoop`, we need to ensure that `innerLoop` is greater than 0.
   - The other variables (`no`, `less`, `num`, `big`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their current states do not affect whether the loop will execute or not.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `innerLoop` to be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`no` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0**
