Postcondition: **`no` is a list, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing `a`, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer. This is because if `x` equals 2, `no` remains unchanged and `less` contains `a`. If `x` is not 2, `no` contains `a` and `less` remains as initially described.**
