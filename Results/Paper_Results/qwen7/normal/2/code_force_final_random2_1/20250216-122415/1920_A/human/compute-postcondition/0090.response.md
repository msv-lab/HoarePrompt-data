Postcondition: `no` is a list, `less` is either an empty list or contains the value 2, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer converted to an integer, `a` is an input integer converted to an integer, `iterable2` is increased by 1. If `x` is equal to 2, then `less` now contains the value `a`. Otherwise, `no` contains `a`.
