Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - The list `no` is empty.
   - `num` is less than or equal to its initial value minus the number of iterations (which is the length of the original `no` list).
   - `big` and `less` lists remain unchanged from their initial states.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for iterable in range(loop):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `iterable`.
   - The loop condition depends on `iterable` being less than `loop`.

4. **Determine the New State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `iterable` is equal to the number of iterations that have already occurred.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `iterable` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `iterable` will be equal to the current number of iterations + 1.

5. **Final State:**
   - `no` remains empty.
   - `num` is still less than or equal to its initial value minus the number of iterations (which is the length of the original `no` list).
   - `big` and `less` lists remain unchanged from their initial states.
   - `iterable` is now one more than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**State:**
- `no` is an empty list.
- `num` is less than or equal to its initial value minus the number of iterations (which is the length of the original `no` list).
- `big` and `less` lists remain unchanged from their initial states.
- `iterable` is one more than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`no` is an empty list, `num` is less than or equal to its initial value minus the number of iterations (which is the length of the original `no` list), `big` and `less` lists remain unchanged from their initial states, `iterable` is one more than it was at the end of the previous iteration.**
