You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, each test case contains an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each constraint, a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1, at least one constraint of type 2, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        cx = set()
        
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        
        bx = -1
        
        for _ in range(n):
            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        
        if bx >= ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
        
    #State: Postcondition: `r` is a list containing up to 3 elements, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed (which is equal to `t`), `_` is `t`, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values provided as inputs, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values provided as inputs. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` contains `[0]`. Otherwise, `r` contains the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`, and `i` is the last element in `cx` that was checked and found to be within the range `[bx, ax]`, or it is the next element in `cx` that is outside this range.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: [0] if bx >= ax, otherwise ax - bx + 1 - tmp
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of constraints where t represents the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n, an integer a in {1, 2, 3}, and an integer x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The function ensures there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
