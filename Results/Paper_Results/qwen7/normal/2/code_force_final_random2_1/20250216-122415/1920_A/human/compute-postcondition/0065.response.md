Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop iterates over `range(loop)`.
- The loop body is omitted.
- After all iterations, `no` is an empty list, and `num` is the final value it reaches after all possible decrements based on the conditions given.

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `iterable` ranges from `0` to `loop-1`.
- Since the loop has completed all its iterations, `iterable` would have taken all values from `0` to `loop-1`.
- The loop body is not provided, but we know that `no` ends up as an empty list and `num` is the final value after all decrements.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial State**: At the start of the first iteration, `iterable` is `0`.
2. **Final State**: After all iterations, `no` is an empty list, and `num` is the final value.

Since the loop has completed all its iterations, the state at the start of the next (non-existent) iteration would logically be the same as the final state of the loop.

### Conclusion:
- `no` is an empty list.
- `num` is the final value it reached after all possible decrements.

### Final Answer:
State: **`no` is an empty list, `num` is the final value it reached after all possible decrements**.
