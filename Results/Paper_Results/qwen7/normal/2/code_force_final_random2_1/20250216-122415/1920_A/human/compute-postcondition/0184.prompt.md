Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive; `r` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx >= ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `r` is a list, `n` is the number of times the loop was executed, `_` is 1, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values provided as inputs, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values provided as inputs. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` contains `[0]`. Otherwise, `r` contains the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`, and `i` is the last element in `cx` that was checked and found to be within the range `[bx, ax]`, or it is the next element in `cx` that is outside this range.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `n` iterations in total. The variables `a` and `x` will each contain the last integer inputs provided by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The variable `cx` will be a set containing all integers `x` that were added to it throughout the loop's iterations. The variables `ax` and `bx` will hold their respective maximum and minimum values based on the inputs received during the loop's execution. Specifically, `ax` will be the smallest integer among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 2, and `bx` will be the largest integer among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1. The variable `_` will be equal to `n`, indicating the total number of iterations the loop executed. Additionally, if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` is a list containing the integer `0`. Otherwise, `r` contains a new element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `_` is equal to `n`, the set `cx` remains unchanged from its final state after the last iteration, the variables `a`, `x`, `ax`, and `bx` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, and the condition `bx < ax` remains true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2 during the loop iterations, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1 during the loop iterations, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 during the loop iterations. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `0` is appended to the list `r`. Otherwise, `bx` is less than `ax`, `cx` is non-empty, `tmp` is 3, and the value of `r` is `(ax - bx + 1 - 3)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
