Postcondition: `no` is a list, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing either `a` (if `x` is 2) or an empty list (if `x` is not 2), `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer. If `x` equals 2, then `less` contains `a`; otherwise, `less` is an empty list.
