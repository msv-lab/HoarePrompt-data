Output State: **`no` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `num` is the final value it reached after all possible decrements.**

Explanation: The code `less = []` creates a new empty list named `less`. This does not affect the existing lists or variables `no` and `num`. Therefore, `no` remains an empty list, and `num` retains its original value which is the final value it reached after all possible decrements.
