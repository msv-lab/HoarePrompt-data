Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `innerLoop` is the total number of iterations, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` and `a` are the values from the last input, `big` contains all the values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` contains all the values of `a` where `x` was 2, and `no` contains all the values of `a` where `x` was any other value; `num` is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. If `num` is less than 1, the value of `num` remains unchanged and the loop continues to the next iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `no` must contain at least one element. If the current value of `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value of the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value of the `big` list, then `num` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `no` must contain at least one element; `i` is the next element in the list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, then `num` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `num` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `no` must contain at least one element; `i` is the next element in the list `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the list `big`, then `num` is the previous value of `num` minus 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
