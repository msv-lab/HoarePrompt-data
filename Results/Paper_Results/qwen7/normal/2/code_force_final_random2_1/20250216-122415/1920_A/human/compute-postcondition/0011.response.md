Output State: **`x` is an input integer with the current value of 1, `a` is appended to the list `big`, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` must be 0**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is an input integer, its value is added to the list, but the actual value of `a` is not specified. The other conditions and the value of `x` remain unchanged.
