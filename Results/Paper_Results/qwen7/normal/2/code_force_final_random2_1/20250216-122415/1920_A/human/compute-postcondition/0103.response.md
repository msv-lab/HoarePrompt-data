Postcondition: **`no` is a list that may contain multiple integers based on the input where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` is either an empty list or contains the value 2 based on the inputs where `x` is 2, `num` is equal to `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `big` is a list that may contain multiple integers based on the input where `x` is 1, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` since it is incremented in each iteration of the loop, and the current value of `num` is less than 1.**
