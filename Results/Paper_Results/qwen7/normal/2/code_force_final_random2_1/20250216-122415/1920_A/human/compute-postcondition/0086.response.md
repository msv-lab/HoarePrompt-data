Output State: **`no` is a list, `less` is either an empty list or contains the value 2, `num` is 0, `big` is a list containing `a`, `x` is an input integer converted to an integer, `a` is an input integer converted to an integer, `iterable2` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `a` is an input integer converted to an integer, it is added to the list `big`. The states of the other variables (`no`, `less`, `num`, `x`, and `iterable2`) are not affected by this operation.
