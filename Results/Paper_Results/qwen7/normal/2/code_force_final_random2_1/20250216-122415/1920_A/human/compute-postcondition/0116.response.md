Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `no`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: At the end of the previous iteration, `no` is a non-empty list, and the first element `i` of `no` either:
   - Is `i - 1` and satisfies being less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list.
   - Remains unchanged as the next element of `no`.
   
   Additionally, `num` is decremented by 1.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the value of `i` from the list `no`, the next `i` value will be the second element of `no`.
   - The list `no` will now be reduced by one element (the first element was processed), so it will contain one fewer element.
   - `num` will be decremented by 1.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `no` will now be a non-empty list (since it had at least two elements before) but with the first element removed.
- `i` will be the second element of the updated `no`.
- `num` will be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`no` is a non-empty list with the first element removed, `i` is the second element of the updated `no`, and `num` is decremented by 1**.
