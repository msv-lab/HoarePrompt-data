Output State: **Postcondition: `r` is a list containing up to 3 elements, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed (which is equal to `t`), `_` is `t`, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values provided as inputs, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values provided as inputs. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` contains `[0]`. Otherwise, `r` contains the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`, and `i` is the last element in `cx` that was checked and found to be within the range `[bx, ax]`, or it is the next element in `cx` that is outside this range.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `r` will contain the results of each iteration according to the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `n` will reflect the total number of iterations (`t`), and `_` will also be equal to `t`. The set `cx` will include all unique `x` values that were not associated with `a` being 1 or 2. The variables `ax` and `bx` will hold the minimum and maximum values of `x` respectively, based on the inputs received during the loop's execution. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` will contain `[0]`. Otherwise, `r` will contain the calculated value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is determined based on the elements in `cx` that lie within the range `[bx, ax]`.
