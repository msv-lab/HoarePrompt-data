Output State: **`ans` is 2, `s` is the substring from the start of `s` up to the character right before 'm', followed by the substring from the character right after 'p' to the end of `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The value of `s` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
