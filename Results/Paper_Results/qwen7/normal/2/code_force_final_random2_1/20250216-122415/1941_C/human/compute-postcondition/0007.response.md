The loop condition is based on the variable `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `s.find('map') != -1`, meaning that the substring 'map' is found in the string `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `ans` is 1
- `s` is a string without the substring 'map'

For the loop to execute one more time, the substring 'map' must be present in `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `s` contains the substring 'map'.

State: **`ans` is 1, `s` must contain the substring 'map'**
