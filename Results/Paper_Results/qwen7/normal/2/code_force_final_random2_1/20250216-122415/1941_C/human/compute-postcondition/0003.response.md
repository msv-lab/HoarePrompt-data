Output State: **`ans` is 0, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6. The string s is not equal to 'mapie', and the sum of all n lengths across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other operations are performed, so the initial state remains unchanged except for the assignment of `ans`. The string `s` and its properties remain the same as the initial state.
