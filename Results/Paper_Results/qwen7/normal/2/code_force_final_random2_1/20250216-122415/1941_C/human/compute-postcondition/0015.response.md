Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `s.find('pie') != -1`. This means the loop will continue as long as the substring 'pie' is found in the string `s`.

2. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `ans` is 3.
   - `s` is the substring 'ma'.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends on the variable `s`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `s.find('pie')` must return a value that is not -1, meaning 'pie' must be found in `s`.

4. **Analyze the current state**:
   - Currently, `s` is 'ma', and it does not contain the substring 'pie'.
   - Therefore, `s.find('pie')` will return -1, and the loop will not execute.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - To make the loop execute at least once, `s` must contain the substring 'pie'.
   - Since the loop increments `ans` each time it finds and removes 'pie', and `ans` is currently 3, this implies that 'pie' was found and removed three times already.
   - Therefore, `s` must have contained 'pie' at least three times initially.

Given these steps, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `s` must contain the substring 'pie' at least three times.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 3, `s` must contain the substring 'pie' at least three times**
