    ans = 0

        ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 3, `s` is the substring 'ma'.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will have the value 3 because the loop increments `ans` each time it finds and removes the substring 'map'. The final state of `s` will be 'ma' because the loop continues to remove 'map' until it can no longer find it, which leaves only 'ma' in the string.
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 6, `s` is the empty string.
    #
    #Explanation: After analyzing the provided loop and its behavior, we can see that the loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in `s`. Each iteration of the loop removes the substring 'pie' from `s` and increments `ans` by 1. 
    #
    #From the given information:
    #- After the loop executes 1 time, `ans` is 4 and `s` does not contain 'pie'.
    #- After the loop executes 2 times, `ans` is 5 and `s` contains 'pi'.
    #- After the loop executes 3 times, `ans` is 6 and `s` contains the substring from the start to the index right before 'pie' plus the substring from the index right after 'pie' to the end.
    #
    #This means that after 3 iterations, `s` still contains some part of 'pie'. However, since the loop continues to remove 'pie' until it can no longer find it, and `ans` reaches 6 after 3 iterations, it implies that the next iteration would remove the remaining 'pie' from `s`, leaving `s` as an empty string. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` will be 6 and `s` will be the empty string.
    return ans
    #The program returns 6 and s is the empty string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns either 1 or 6. If the string `s` is exactly 'mapie', it returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' and then all occurrences of the substring 'pie', incrementing a counter `ans` for each removal. After processing, if any part of 'pie' remains, `ans` will be 6 and `s` will be an empty string; otherwise, it returns 1.
