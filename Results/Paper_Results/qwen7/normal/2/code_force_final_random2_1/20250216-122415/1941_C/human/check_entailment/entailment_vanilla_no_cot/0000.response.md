Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases where the string needs to be shortened. Specifically, the function `func_1` only removes the substrings "map" and "pie" one at a time and does not consider overlapping occurrences. For example, in the string "mapmapmap", the current implementation would incorrectly return 3 instead of 2, as it removes "map" three times sequentially rather than recognizing that removing the middle "map" would also remove an adjacent "map". 

To fix this, the function should use a more efficient approach to find and remove overlapping substrings. One way to do this is by using regular expressions to match and remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" in a single pass. Here's an improved version of the function:

```python
import re

def func_1(s):
    # Use regular expressions to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie"
    s = re.sub(r'map|pie', '', s)
    return len(s)

# The rest of the code remains the same
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
```

This revised function uses the `re.sub` method to replace all occurrences of "map" and "pie" with an empty string, effectively removing them. This approach ensures that all instances of these substrings are removed, even if they overlap, and returns the correct minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful.
