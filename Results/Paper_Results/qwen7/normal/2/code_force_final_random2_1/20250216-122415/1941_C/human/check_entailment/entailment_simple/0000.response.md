Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly identifies that the function `func_1` should handle the removal of substrings "map" and "pie" to make the string beautiful.
2. The logic for handling the substring "map" is correct. It iteratively finds and removes "map" from the string, incrementing the count of deletions each time.
3. The logic for handling the substring "pie" is also correct. It iteratively finds and removes "pie" from the string, incrementing the count of deletions each time.
4. The function correctly handles the edge case where the string is "mapie" by returning 1, as removing one character ("a") makes it beautiful.
5. The overall approach ensures that the minimum number of characters are removed to make the string beautiful, as it removes each occurrence of "map" and "pie" separately and cumulatively counts the deletions.

Given the analysis, the provided implementation appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided states.

Correctness: **True**
