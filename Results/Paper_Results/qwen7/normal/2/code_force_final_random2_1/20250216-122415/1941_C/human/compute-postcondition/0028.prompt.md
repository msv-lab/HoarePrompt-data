You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6. The sum of all n lengths across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1(s):
    if (s == 'mapie') :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6. The string s is not equal to 'mapie', and the sum of all n lengths across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 3, `s` is the substring 'ma'.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will have the value 3 because the loop increments `ans` each time it finds and removes the substring 'map'. The final state of `s` will be 'ma' because the loop continues to remove 'map' until it can no longer find it, which leaves only 'ma' in the string.
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 6, `s` is the empty string.
    #
    #Explanation: After analyzing the provided loop and its behavior, we can see that the loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in `s`. Each iteration of the loop removes the substring 'pie' from `s` and increments `ans` by 1. 
    #
    #From the given information:
    #- After the loop executes 1 time, `ans` is 4 and `s` does not contain 'pie'.
    #- After the loop executes 2 times, `ans` is 5 and `s` contains 'pi'.
    #- After the loop executes 3 times, `ans` is 6 and `s` contains the substring from the start to the index right before 'pie' plus the substring from the index right after 'pie' to the end.
    #
    #This means that after 3 iterations, `s` still contains some part of 'pie'. However, since the loop continues to remove 'pie' until it can no longer find it, and `ans` reaches 6 after 3 iterations, it implies that the next iteration would remove the remaining 'pie' from `s`, leaving `s` as an empty string. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` will be 6 and `s` will be the empty string.
    return ans
    #The program returns 6 and s is the empty string.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter s, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6. The function returns 1 unless s is the empty string, in which case it returns 6.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns 6 and s is the empty string.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
