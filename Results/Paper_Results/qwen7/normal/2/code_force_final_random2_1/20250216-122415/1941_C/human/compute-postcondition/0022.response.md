Output State: **`ans` is 5; `s` contains the substring from the start to the index right before 'pie' plus the substring from the index right after 'pie' to the end.**

Explanation: The code replaces the substring 'pie' in `s` with nothing, effectively removing 'pie' from `s`. Since `s` originally contained the substring 'pie', after the operation, `s` will now contain the part of the string from the start up to but not including 'pie', concatenated with the part of the string right after 'pie' to the end. The value of `ans` remains unchanged at 5.
