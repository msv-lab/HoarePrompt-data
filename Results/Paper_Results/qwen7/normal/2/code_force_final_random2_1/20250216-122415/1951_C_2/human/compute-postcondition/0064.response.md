Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, m, k, and a. It iterates over t test cases, where for each test case, it takes n, m, k as integers and a as a list of n integers. The function does not return a value directly but processes the input data according to the given constraints.**
