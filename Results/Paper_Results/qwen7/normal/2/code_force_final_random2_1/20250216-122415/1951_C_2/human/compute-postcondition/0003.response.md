Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `l` is a list of sorted integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `l` is updated to contain its elements in sorted order.
