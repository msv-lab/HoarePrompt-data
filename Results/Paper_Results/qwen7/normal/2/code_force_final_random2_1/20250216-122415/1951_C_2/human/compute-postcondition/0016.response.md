Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - s`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `s`. The initial state shows that `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, but since `m` is not directly involved in the operation, the updated value of `k` is simply its original value minus `s`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
