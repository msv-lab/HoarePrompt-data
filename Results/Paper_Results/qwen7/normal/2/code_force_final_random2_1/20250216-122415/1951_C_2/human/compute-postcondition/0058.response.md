Output State: **`c` is `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` is reduced by `s`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= s` reduces the value of `k` by `s`. The other variables (`c`, `i`, `n`, `s`) are not affected by this line of code. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `i + 2` remains unchanged. The value of `s` is still the minimum of `m` and `k`, and `k` has been updated to `k - s`.
