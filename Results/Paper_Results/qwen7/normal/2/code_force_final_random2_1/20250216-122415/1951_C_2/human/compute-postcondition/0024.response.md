Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of sorted integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `l` is modified to be sorted.
