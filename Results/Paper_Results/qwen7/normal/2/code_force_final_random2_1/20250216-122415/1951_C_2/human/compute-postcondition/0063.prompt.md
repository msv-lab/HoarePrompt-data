Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9). a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    s = 0
    c = k * k / 2
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        k -= s
        c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` in the range of `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning it has gone through all the iterations. The variable `n` must still be greater than 0. The variable `c` will hold the cumulative value of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is `k - n * s`, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the input integer `n`. The variable `k` will be reduced by `n` times the value of `s` (where `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`). The variable `c` will hold the cumulative sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `c` will be the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`, `i` will be equal to `n`, `s` will be the minimum of `m` and `k` after the last iteration, and `k` will be reduced by `s` after the last iteration.

In simpler terms, `c` will hold the cumulative result of the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all iterations, with `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `i` will increment to `n` after the loop completes. The value of `s` will be the minimum of `m` and `k` right before the loop ends, and `k` will be decreased by this value `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
