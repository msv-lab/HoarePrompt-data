Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `n` is the first integer input.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is already 0, it satisfies the initial condition `i < n` if `n` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **List the necessary adjustments**:
   - `i` is already 0.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

So, the final state adjustment needed for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
