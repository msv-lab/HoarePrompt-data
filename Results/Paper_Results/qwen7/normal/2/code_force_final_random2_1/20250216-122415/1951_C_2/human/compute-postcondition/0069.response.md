Output State: **`i` is `n`, `s` is `s + min(m, k)`, `k` is `k - 2 * min(m, k)`, `c` is `c + min(m, k) * (l[n] + t) + s * (l[i] + t)`, `t` is `t + 2 * min(m, k) + s**.

Explanation: The value of `t` is incremented by `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `i` is still `n`, `s` is now `s + min(m, k)`, `k` remains `k - 2 * min(m, k)`, `c` remains `c + min(m, k) * (l[n] + t) + s * (l[i] + t)`, and `t` is updated to `t + 2 * min(m, k) + s`.
