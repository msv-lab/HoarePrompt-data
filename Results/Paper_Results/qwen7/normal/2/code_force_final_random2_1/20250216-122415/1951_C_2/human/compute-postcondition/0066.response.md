Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n`
   - `s` is `min(m, k)`
   - `k` is `k - min(m, k) - min(m, k)`
   - `c` is `c + min(m, k) * (l[n] + t)`
   - `t` is `t + min(m, k) + min(m, k)`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the loop will not execute again because `i` is no longer less than `n`.
   - Therefore, we do not need to change the value of `i` or `n` for the next iteration.

5. **Other variables**: The other variables (`s`, `k`, `c`, `t`) are not part of the loop head, so their values remain unchanged for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the current state since the loop will not execute again.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `k - min(m, k) - min(m, k)`, `c` is `c + min(m, k) * (l[n] + t)`, `t` is `t + min(m, k) + min(m, k)`**
