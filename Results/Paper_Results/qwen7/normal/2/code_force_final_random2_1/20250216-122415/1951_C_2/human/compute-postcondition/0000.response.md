Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`. 

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Typically, `i` starts from 0 in a `range` function unless specified otherwise.

4. **Determine the Value of `int(input())`**: The value of `int(input())` is not known until runtime, but we know it is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive).

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing. Specifically, we need to ensure that `i` starts from 0 and `int(input())` provides a valid number of iterations.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- The input value should be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

Putting this together, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, the input value must be an integer between 1 and 10^4**.
