Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `k` is updated by `k - s`
   - `c` is updated by `l[0] * s - s * s / 2`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

6. **Keep other variables unchanged**: The variables `k` and `c` are not part of the loop head, so they remain as they are.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - s`, `c` is `l[0] * s - s * s / 2`**
