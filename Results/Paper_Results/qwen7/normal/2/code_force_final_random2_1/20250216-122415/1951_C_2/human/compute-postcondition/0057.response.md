Output State: **`c` is `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` is reduced by `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s = min(m, k)` updates the value of `s` to be the minimum of `m` and `k`. The other variables (`c`, `i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `i + 2` is still valid.
