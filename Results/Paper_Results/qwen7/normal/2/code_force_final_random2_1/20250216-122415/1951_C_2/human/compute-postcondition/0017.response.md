Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is `c + l[2] * s - s * s / 2`**.

In this output state, the variable `i` remains unchanged at 2, and `n` retains its condition of being greater than 0. The variable `c` is updated to its previous value plus the expression `l[2] * s - s * s / 2`. Here, `l[2]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `l`, and the rest of the expression is evaluated accordingly.
