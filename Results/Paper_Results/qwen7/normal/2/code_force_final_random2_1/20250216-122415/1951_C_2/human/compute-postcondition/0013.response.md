Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is `c + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is updated by adding the value of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. Since `i` is initially 1, the expression becomes `l[1] * s - s * s / 2`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
