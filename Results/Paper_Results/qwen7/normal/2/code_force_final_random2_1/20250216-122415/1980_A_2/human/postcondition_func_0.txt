The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer t (number of cases), integers n and m, and a string s of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to ensure that each character in the set 'ABCDEF' appears at least m times in the string s.
