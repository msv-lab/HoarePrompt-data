Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `p`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 'F'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEF'
   - If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is the value of `ans` before the addition plus the value of `m`.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `p` to iterate over.
   - Since `p` is 'ABCDEF' and `i` is 'F', the next character in `p` is 'A'.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will now be 'A'.
   - `p` will remain 'ABCDEF' since it hasn't changed yet.

6. **Consider the postcondition**: The postcondition checks if `i` is not in `hmp`. If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is updated. However, this information is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop state.

Given the above analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop are `i` and `p`.

**State: **`i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEF'**
