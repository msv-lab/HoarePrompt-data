Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in hmp`. The variables involved here are `i` and `hmp`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `hmp` must contain the character 'F', and `i` is the next key in `hmp`. Additionally, if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. If `hmp[i]` is greater than or equal to `m`, no change is made to `ans`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `i`: Since `i` is the next key in `hmp`, it will be the key after the current one. Therefore, `i` will be the next key in `hmp`.
   - `hmp`: `hmp` must still contain the character 'F' because it is a condition that needs to be maintained throughout the loop.
   - `ans`: The value of `ans` depends on the value of `hmp[i]` relative to `m`. If `hmp[i]` was less than `m` in the previous iteration, `ans` would have been increased by `m - hmp[i]`. For the next iteration, `hmp[i]` will be checked again.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is:

- `i` will be the next key in `hmp`.
- `hmp` must still contain the character 'F'.
- `ans` will be adjusted based on the value of `hmp[i]` relative to `m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`hmp` must contain the character 'F', `i` is the next key in `hmp`, `ans` will be adjusted based on the value of `hmp[i]` relative to `m`**.
