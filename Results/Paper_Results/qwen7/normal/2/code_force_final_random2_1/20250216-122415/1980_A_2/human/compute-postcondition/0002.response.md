Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
