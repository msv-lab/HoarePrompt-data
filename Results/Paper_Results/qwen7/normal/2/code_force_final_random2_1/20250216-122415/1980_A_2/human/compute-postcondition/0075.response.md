Output State: **`i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 6 * m, `hmp` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' each mapped to m, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string**.

The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `s` which holds the input string.
