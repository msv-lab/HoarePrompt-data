Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is an integer within the specified range (1 to 1000), the initial state of `t` being an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 is maintained, but now `t` specifically holds the value of the input integer.
