Postcondition: `t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the variable `b`, `t` is equal to `b`, and `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, or to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1` otherwise, where `t2 = a - t1`.
