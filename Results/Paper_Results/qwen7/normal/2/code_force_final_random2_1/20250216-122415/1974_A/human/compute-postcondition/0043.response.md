Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the variable `b`, `t` is equal to `b`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t` is `t + t2 // 15`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` by adding `t2 // 15` to it. Since `t2` is defined as `a - t1`, the updated value of `t` is `b + (a - t1) // 15`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
