Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2; `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split; `b` is the integer value of the second word from the input split; `t` is equal to `b`; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `a` is converted to an integer.**

The code `a = int(a)` converts the value of `a` to an integer. Since `a` was already supposed to be an integer (as it is the integer value of the first word from the input split), this operation does not change its value. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.
