Postcondition: `t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the variable `b`, `t` is equal to `b`, and depending on whether `t` (which is initially `b`) is even, `t` is either `b // 2` or `b // 2 + 1`.
