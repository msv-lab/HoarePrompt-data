Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation: The variable `t2` is assigned the value of `a - t1`. Given the initial conditions, `t1` can be either 0 or 30, and `a` is an integer from the first input split. Since `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` will be either `a - 0` (which is `a`) or `a - 30`. The other variables remain unchanged.
