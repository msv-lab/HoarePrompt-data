Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2; `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split; `b` is the integer value of the second word from the input split and now an integer; `t` is equal to `b`; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t` is equal to `b`; `t` is divided by 2.**

Explanation: The code `t = t // 2` divides the value of `t` by 2 using integer division. Since `t` is equal to `b`, and `b` is the integer value of the second word from the input split, `t` is now half of its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
