Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the variable `b`**.

Explanation: The line `b = int(b)` converts the variable `b` to an integer. However, since `b` was not defined before this line, it is unclear what its original value was. After executing this line, `b` is now an integer. The other variables (`t1`, `n`, `i`, and `a`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code.
