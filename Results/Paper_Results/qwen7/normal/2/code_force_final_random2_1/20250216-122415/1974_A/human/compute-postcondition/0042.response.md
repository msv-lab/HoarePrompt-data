Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the variable `b`, `t` is equal to `b`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`**.

In natural language: `t1` remains either 0 or 30, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 1, `a` remains the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` remains the integer value of the variable `b`, `t` remains equal to `b`, `t1` remains calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is now the value of `a - t1`.
