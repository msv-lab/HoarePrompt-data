Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the variable `b`, `t` is equal to `b`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `b` to `t`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t1`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` are preserved, and `t` now holds the value of `b`.
