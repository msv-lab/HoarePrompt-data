Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the variable `b`, `t` is equal to `b`, and `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

Explanation: The code updates `t1` based on the formula `t * 15 - b * 4`. Since `t` is equal to `b`, `t1` becomes `b * 15 - b * 4`, which simplifies to `b * 11`. The value of `b` can be either even or odd, but `t1` will always be a multiple of 11. Given the initial conditions, the output state includes the updated calculation for `t1` and retains the other variables as described.
