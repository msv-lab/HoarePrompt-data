You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be the final value it takes after processing all the inputs provided by the user within the range specified by `n`. The value of `t` will be updated based on the conditions given in each iteration of the loop. Specifically, `t` starts as `b` and is modified according to the following rules:
    #- If `t` is even, it is halved (`t = t // 2`).
    #- If `t` is odd, it is halved and incremented by one (`t = t // 2 + 1`).
    #- After modifying `t`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
    #- If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains unchanged.
    #- If `t1 < a`, `t` is updated based on the value of `t2 = a - t1`:
    #  - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`.
    #  - Otherwise, `t` is increased by `(t2 // 15) + 1`.
    #
    #The final value of `t` will reflect these operations applied sequentially for each input pair `(a, b)` provided within the loop's range `n`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is the number of 1x1 icons and `b` is the number of 2x2 icons.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b`.
   - If `b` is even, `t` is divided by 2.
   - If `b` is odd, `t` is divided by 2 and then incremented by 1. This ensures that `t` correctly accounts for the number of 2x2 icons that need to be placed, considering they occupy 4 cells each.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space After Placing 2x2 Icons**:
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. Here, `15` is the total number of cells available on one screen, and `4` is the number of cells occupied by each 2x2 icon.
   - This calculation determines how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons.

4. **Checking if Remaining 1x1 Icons Fit**:
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then no additional screens are needed, and `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, the remaining 1x1 icons (`a - t1`) are checked to see how many more screens are needed. Each additional screen can hold up to 15 icons.
   - The number of additional screens required is calculated as `t2 // 15 + 1` if there is any remainder (`t2 % 15 != 0`).

5. **Outputting the Result**:
   - The final value of `t` is printed, which represents the minimum number of screens needed.

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples to verify its correctness.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `1 1`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 1` (since `1` is odd, `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`)
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - `t1 >= 1` is true, so `t` remains `1`.
- Output: `1` (Correct)

#### Example 2:
- Input: `7 2`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 2` (since `2` is even, `t = 2 // 2 = 1`)
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`
  - `t1 >= 7` is true, so `t` remains `1`.
- Output: `1` (Correct)

#### Example 3:
- Input: `12 4`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 4` (since `4` is even, `t = 4 // 2 = 2`)
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`
  - `t1 >= 12` is true, so `t` remains `2`.
- Output: `2` (Correct)

#### Example 4:
- Input: `0 3`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 3` (since `3` is odd, `t = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2`)
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`
  - `t1 >= 0` is true, so `t` remains `2`.
- Output: `2` (Correct)

#### Example 5:
- Input: `1 0`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 0` (since `0` is even, `t = 0 // 2 = 0`)
  - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - `t1 >= 1` is false, so `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1`, and `t = 0 + 1 // 15 + 1 = 1`.
- Output: `1` (Correct)
