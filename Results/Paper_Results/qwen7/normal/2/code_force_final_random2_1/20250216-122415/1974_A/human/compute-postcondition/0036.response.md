Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of variable `b`, `t` is equal to `b`, `t` is now `b // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to be `t // 2`, which means `t` is now half of its original value (integer division). Since `t` was originally equal to `b`, `t` is now `b // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
