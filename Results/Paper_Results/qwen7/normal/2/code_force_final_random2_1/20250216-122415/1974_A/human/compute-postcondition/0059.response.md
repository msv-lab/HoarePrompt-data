Output State: **`t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is equal to `b`, if `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2, otherwise, `t` is updated to `(b // 2) + 1`, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word from the input split, `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `t1` based on the formula `t * 15 - b * 4`. It also updates `t` to be equal to `b`. After that, `t` is modified based on whether it is even or odd. The values of `i`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and the calculation logic for `t1` remain as described in the initial state.
