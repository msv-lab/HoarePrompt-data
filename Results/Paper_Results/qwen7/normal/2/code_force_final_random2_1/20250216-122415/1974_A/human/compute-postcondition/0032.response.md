Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the first word from the input split, `b` is the second word from the input split.**

The code `a, b = input().split()` takes a single line of input and splits it into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter. The first part is assigned to `a` and the second part is assigned to `b`. The values of `t1`, `n`, `i`, and the initial conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
