Output State: **`t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is equal to `b`, if `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2, otherwise, `t` is updated to `(b // 2) + 1`, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word from the input split, `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `t2` as `a - t1`. The values of `t1`, `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `t2` is now dependent on the values of `a` and `t1`.
