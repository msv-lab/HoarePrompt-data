Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to the sum of all `f` values entered over all iterations, `j` is `m`, `f` is the last integer from the input in the final iteration, `a` is the first integer from the input in the final iteration, `b` is the second integer from the input in the final iteration, `p` is equal to `p // gcd`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)**

Explanation: The line `p = p // gcd` divides `p` by its greatest common divisor (`gcd`). This operation updates the value of `p` to its simplified form. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
