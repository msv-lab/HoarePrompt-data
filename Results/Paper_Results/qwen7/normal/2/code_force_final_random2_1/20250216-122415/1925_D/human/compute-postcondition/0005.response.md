Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the range function which involves `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the variables in the loop head**:
   - `j` is not initialized in the given state, but it will start from 0 as per the range function.
   - `m` is an integer obtained from the input split.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1 (since the range function starts from 0 and goes up to `m-1`).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `m` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `j` will start from 0 as per the range function, so no adjustment is needed for `j`.
   - `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `sum_f` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `sum_f` is 0**
