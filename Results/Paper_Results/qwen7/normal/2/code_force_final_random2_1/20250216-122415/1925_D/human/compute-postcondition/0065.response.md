Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, so `i` will be equal to `t-1`. For each iteration `i`, the variables `m`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `sum_f`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, `cn2`, and `n` will hold the values from the last iteration of the inner loop. Specifically, `sum_f` will be the total sum of all `f` values entered across all iterations, `p` and `q` will be reduced by their greatest common divisor, and `cn2` will be calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` based on the last `n` value from any iteration. The final output will be the result of the expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` computed with the values from the last iteration.

In summary, after all iterations, `i` will be `t-1`, and all other variables will reflect the state of the last iteration of the inner loop.
