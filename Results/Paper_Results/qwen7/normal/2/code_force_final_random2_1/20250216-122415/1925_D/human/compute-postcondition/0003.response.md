Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0 and `i` is still 0. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers entered by the user.
