### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided formula for calculating the expected value is incorrect. Let's break down the problem and the program's logic to understand why the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
- If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
- The expected value should consider the probability of picking each pair and how the friendship value changes over excursions.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Sum of Friendship Values Calculation:**
   - The program correctly sums up the friendship values of all given pairs.
   
2. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - The expression `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` is used to calculate the numerator of the expected value.
   - `cn2` is calculated as \( \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \), representing the total number of unique pairs from `n` children.
   - However, this formula does not account for the probability of picking each pair and the changes in friendship values over excursions.

3. **GCD Calculation and Simplification:**
   - The GCD calculation and simplification steps are correct and necessary to ensure the fraction is in its simplest form.
   
4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The use of modular arithmetic (`pow(q, -1, M)`) to find the modular inverse is correct.

#### Correct Expected Value Calculation:
To correctly calculate the expected value, we need to consider the following:
- The probability of picking each pair of friends in each excursion.
- The increase in friendship value for each pair of friends when chosen.

The correct approach involves calculating the expected value for each pair of friends separately and then summing these values. For a pair of friends `(a, b)` with initial friendship value `f`, the expected increase in friendship value per excursion is `k / cn2`. Therefore, the expected value for this pair is `f + k / cn2`.

Summing these expected values for all pairs of friends gives us the overall expected value.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified that the provided formula in the program does not accurately reflect the expected value as described in the problem statement. The program's formula does not account for the probability of picking each pair and the changes in friendship values over excursions.
