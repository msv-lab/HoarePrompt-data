Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to the sum of all `f` values entered over all iterations, `j` is `m`, `f` is the last integer from the input in the final iteration, `a` is the first integer from the input in the final iteration, `b` is the second integer from the input in the final iteration, `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `q` the value of `2 * cn2 ** 2`. Since `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `q` becomes `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
