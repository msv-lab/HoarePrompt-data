Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4, `M` is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code initializes a constant `M` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is 1000000007. This value does not affect the variable `t`, which remains an integer within the specified range. Therefore, the output state retains the initial condition for `t` and introduces the new constant `M`.
