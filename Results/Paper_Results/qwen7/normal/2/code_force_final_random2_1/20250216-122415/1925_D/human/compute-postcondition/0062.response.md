Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `j` is equal to `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all input integers `f` from each iteration of the loop, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` where `n` is an input integer, `p` is `p // gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd**.

Explanation: The code `q = q // gcd` divides `q` by `gcd`. Given that `q` was initially `2 * cn2`, after executing the code, `q` becomes `2 * cn2 // gcd`. All other variables remain unchanged.
