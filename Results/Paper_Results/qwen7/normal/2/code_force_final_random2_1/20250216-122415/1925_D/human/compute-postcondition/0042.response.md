Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to the sum of all `f` values entered over all iterations, `j` is `m`, `f` is the last integer from the input in the final iteration, `a` is the first integer from the input in the final iteration, `b` is the second integer from the input in the final iteration, `p` is equal to `p // gcd`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `q` is `q // gcd`**.

Explanation: The code `q = q // gcd` divides the value of `q` by `gcd`. Since `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, dividing `q` by `gcd` simplifies `q` to its value divided by their greatest common divisor. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
