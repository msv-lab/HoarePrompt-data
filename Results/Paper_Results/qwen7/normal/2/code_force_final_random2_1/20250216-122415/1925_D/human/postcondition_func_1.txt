The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a specified number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions. For each test case, it reads the number of children (n), pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k), along with the friendship values between pairs of children. It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters to compute a result based on the given inputs. Finally, it prints the computed result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case, with the final state of `t` being 0.
