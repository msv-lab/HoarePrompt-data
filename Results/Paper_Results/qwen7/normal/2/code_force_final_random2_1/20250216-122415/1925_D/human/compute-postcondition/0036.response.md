Output State: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to the sum of all `f` values entered over all iterations, `j` is `m`, `f` is the last integer from the input in the final iteration, `a` is the first integer from the input in the final iteration, `b` is the second integer from the input in the final iteration.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `m` will still be greater than 0 (as long as there are more inputs to process), `a` and `b` will hold the values from the first input pair of the last iteration, `sum_f` will contain the total sum of all `f` values entered throughout the loop's iterations, `j` will be equal to `m` (the total number of iterations), and `f` will be the `f` value from the last iteration.
