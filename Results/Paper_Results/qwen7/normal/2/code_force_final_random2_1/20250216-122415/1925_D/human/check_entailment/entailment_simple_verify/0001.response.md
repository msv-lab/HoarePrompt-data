### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-examine the problem and the program to determine if the original assessment was accurate or not.

#### Problem Restatement:
We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. If a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. The friendship value of a pair who are not friends remains 0 and does not change.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Friendship Value Increase**: When a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion.
2. **Probability of Choosing a Pair**: Each pair is chosen randomly with equal probability.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: We need to calculate the expected increase in friendship values over k excursions.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
2. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The program correctly sums up the friendship values of all given pairs.
3. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The program calculates the combinatorial part incorrectly. The formula `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` does not account for the probability of choosing each pair and the changes in friendship values over excursions.
4. **GCD and Simplification**: The GCD calculation and simplification steps are correct.
5. **Modular Arithmetic**: The use of modular arithmetic to find the modular inverse is correct.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
- The probability of choosing a specific pair in each excursion.
- The expected increase in friendship values for each pair over k excursions.

The correct expected value for a single pair (a, b) with initial friendship value `f` is:
\[ E_{(a,b)} = f \cdot \left(1 + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}\right) \]

For all pairs, the expected value is the sum of the expected values for each pair.

#### Correct Formula:
The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values is:
\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot \left(1 + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}\right) \]

This formula accounts for the initial friendship value and the expected increase due to the excursions.

#### Conclusion:
The original program uses an incorrect formula for the expected value calculation. The given formula does not account for the probability of choosing each pair and the changes in friendship values over excursions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the error in the expected value calculation formula. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
