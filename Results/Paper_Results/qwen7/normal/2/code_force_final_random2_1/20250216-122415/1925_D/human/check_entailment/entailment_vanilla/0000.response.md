Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, the number of friend pairs `m`, and the number of excursions `k`.
   - It also reads the details of each friend pair `(a, b, f)` and sums up these friendship values into `sum_f`.

2. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - The variable `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which represents the total number of unique pairs of children.
   - The formula used to calculate the numerator `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

3. **GCD Calculation and Simplification:**
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` is computed using `math.gcd`.
   - Both `p` and `q` are then divided by their GCD to simplify the fraction.
   - Finally, the result is printed as `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`, where `pow(q, -1, M)` computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness Check:

1. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The sum of friendship values `sum_f` is correctly calculated from the input.

2. **Combinatorial Formula:**
   - The formula for `p` seems to be derived from the expected value calculation. However, let's verify if it matches the problem statement.
     - The term `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f` accounts for the initial expected value contribution from the friendship values.
     - The term `m * k * (k - 1)` accounts for the additional contributions due to the increase in friendship values over subsequent excursions.
   - The denominator `q` should represent the total number of ways to pick pairs without considering the friendship values.

3. **GCD and Simplification:**
   - The GCD calculation and simplification steps are correct and necessary to ensure the fraction is in its simplest form.

4. **Modular Inverse:**
   - The use of modular inverse to compute the final result is correct and ensures the result fits within the required modulus \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code, the logic appears to be consistent with the problem statement and the mathematical derivations. The program correctly calculates the expected value and handles the required constraints.

**Correctness: True**
