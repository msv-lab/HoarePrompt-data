Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f` plus `f`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be `m-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`, so `j` should be incremented to `m-1 + 1 = m`.
   - The value of `m` remains the same unless modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `m` stays the same.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `m` must still be greater than 0 (unchanged).
   - `a` remains an input integer (unchanged).
   - `b` remains an input integer (unchanged).
   - `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f` plus `f` (unchanged).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f` plus `f`, `j` is `m`**.
