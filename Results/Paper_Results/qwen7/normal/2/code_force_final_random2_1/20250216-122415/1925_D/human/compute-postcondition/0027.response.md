Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The initial condition that `m` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are now specific integers based on user input.
