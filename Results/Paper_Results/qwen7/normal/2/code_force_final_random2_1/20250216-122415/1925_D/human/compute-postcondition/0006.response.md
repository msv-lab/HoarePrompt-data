Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split, `sum_f` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The values of `t`, `i`, `m`, `n`, `k`, and `sum_f` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 are still valid. The values of `n` and `k` are not used in the given code, so they retain their initial state of being integers obtained from input.
