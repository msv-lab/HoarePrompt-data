Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`**

The code `sum_f += f` updates the value of `sum_f` by adding the value of `f` to it. Since `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` now holds the sum of its previous value and `f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
