Output State: **results is ['no', 'no', 'no'].**

Natural Language Description: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the `results` list will contain three elements, each being 'no'. This is because the conditions to append 'yes' were not met in any of the iterations, and the loop primarily appends 'no' to the `results` list unless specific conditions for 'yes' are satisfied, which in this case were not met.
