Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is a positive integer minus 1.
   - `start` is an integer.
   - `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
   - `n` is the integer input by the user.
   - `s` is the new input string from the user.
   - `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the new string `s`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.

3. **Conditions for No Change:**
   - If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is even, no changes are made to the variables.
   - If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is odd or `cnt1` == 1, no changes are made to the variables.
   - If `cnt1` > 2 and '11' is found in the string `s`, no changes are made to the variables.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop head only includes the variable `t`.
   - Since the loop runs `t` times, `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

5. **Final State After One Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer minus 1.
   - After one iteration, `t` will be reduced by 1, making it a positive integer minus 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 2, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the new input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the new string `s`**.
