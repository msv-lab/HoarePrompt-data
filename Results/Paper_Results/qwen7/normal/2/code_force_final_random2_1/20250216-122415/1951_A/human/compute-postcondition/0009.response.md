Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s`. The current value of `cnt1` is greater than 2 and either `cnt1` is odd or `cnt1` equals 1.
