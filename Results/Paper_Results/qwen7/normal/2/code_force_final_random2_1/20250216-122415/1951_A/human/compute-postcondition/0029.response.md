Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer minus 1, so `t` could be any integer like 0, 1, 2, etc., but it is not explicitly needed for the print statement.
- `start` is an integer and `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `s` is the new input string from the user.
- `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the new string `s`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
