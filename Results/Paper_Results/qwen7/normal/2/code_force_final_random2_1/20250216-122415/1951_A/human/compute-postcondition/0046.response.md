Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer minus 2, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the new input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s`. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is even, no changes are made to the variables. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is odd or `cnt1` == 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `'11'` is found in `s`, no changes are made to the variables. If none of the above conditions are met, no changes are made to the variables.**
