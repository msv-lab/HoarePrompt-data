Reasoning:
The given program consists of two separate functions: `generate_files_for_html_in_range` and `func_1`. The execution summary describes the behavior of `func_1`, which processes multiple inputs and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. However, the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is not mentioned in the execution summary. 

The task is to determine if the given program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Since the execution summary only describes `func_1` and does not mention `generate_files_for_html_in_range`, we should focus on whether `func_1` meets the requirements described in the execution summary.

Given that `func_1` processes inputs, checks conditions, and prints results without modifying external variables, it appears to be correct according to the provided execution summary. However, since the problem description and execution summary do not mention the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function at all, we cannot evaluate its correctness based on the given information.

Since the question asks specifically about the correctness of the entire program based on the provided execution summary, and the execution summary only covers `func_1`, we can only assess the correctness of `func_1`.

Correctness: **True**
