Output State: **`t` is 0, `result` is a string containing the elements of the list `a` joined by spaces, `n` is an input integer, `line` is the new input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer, `a` is a list starting with 1000, followed by `n-1` elements, each computed as the previous element minus the corresponding value in `T`.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` converts each element of the string `line` (which is the new input provided by the user) into an integer and stores them in the list `T`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
