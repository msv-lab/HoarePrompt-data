Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `result` is '1000', `n` must be at least 2, `line` remains as the initial input provided by the user, `T` remains as the list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer, `a` is a list starting with 1000, followed by `n-1` elements, each computed as the previous element minus the corresponding value in `T`, and `result` is now a string containing the elements of the list `a` joined by spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` joins the elements of the list `a` into a single string, with each element converted to a string and separated by a space.
- The list `a` is defined as starting with 1000, followed by `n-1` elements, each computed as the previous element minus the corresponding value in `T`.
- The values of `t`, `result`, `n`, `line`, and `T` remain unchanged from their initial states.
