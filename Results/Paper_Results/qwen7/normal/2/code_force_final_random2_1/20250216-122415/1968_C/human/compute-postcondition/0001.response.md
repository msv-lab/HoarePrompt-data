The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero.

Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive) and it is the input integer from the user, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is non-zero. Since the problem does not provide any additional constraints or conditions that would make `t` zero, we can assume that `t` being within the specified range already ensures it is non-zero.

Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `t` to be non-zero as it is already guaranteed to be between 1 and \(10^4\).

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive)**
