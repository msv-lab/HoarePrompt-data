Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is updated such that its last element is now the value of the element before the last one minus the value of `T` at the index before the last one.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i = n-1`.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop condition is `i < n`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is updated such that its last element is now the value of the element before the last one minus the value of `T` at the index before the last one.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - In the current iteration, `i` is in the range `[1, n-1]`.
   - After the loop, `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1` (since `i` is incremented by 1).

### New State
- `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i` will be incremented to `i + 1` and must still be less than `n`).
- `a` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `a` is updated such that its last element is now the value of the element before the last one minus the value of `T` at the index before the last one.**
