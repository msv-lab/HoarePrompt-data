Given the initial state, the list `a` is reversed, and `result` is a string containing the elements of the reversed list `a` separated by spaces. Since the exact elements of the original list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the reversed list.

Let's assume the original list `a` was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. After reversing it, the list becomes `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. Therefore, `result` would be the string `"5 4 3 2 1"`.

Output: **"5 4 3 2 1"** (where the string is the space-separated elements of the reversed list `a`)
