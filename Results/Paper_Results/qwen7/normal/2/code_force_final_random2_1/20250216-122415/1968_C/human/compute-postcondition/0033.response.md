Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `result` is '1000', `n` must be at least 2, `line` remains as the initial input provided by the user, `T` remains as the list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer, `a` is a list starting with 1000, followed by `n-1` elements, each computed as the previous element minus the corresponding value in `T`, and `a` is reversed.**

Explanation: The code `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. Since `a` was originally defined as a list starting with 1000, followed by `n-1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`, after reversing, the first element of `a` will now be the last element of the original `a`, and so on. All other variables (`t`, `result`, `n`, `line`, and `T`) remain unchanged.
