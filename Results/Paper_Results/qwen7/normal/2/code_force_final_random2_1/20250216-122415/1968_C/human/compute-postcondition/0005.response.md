Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `line` is a string input from the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each part to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` splits the string `line` into parts based on spaces and converts each part to an integer, creating a list `T` of these integers. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
