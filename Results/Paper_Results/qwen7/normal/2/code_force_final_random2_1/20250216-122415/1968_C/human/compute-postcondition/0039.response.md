Output State: **`t` is 0, `result` is '1000', `n` is an input integer, `line` remains as the initial input provided by the user, `T` remains as the list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer, `a` is a list starting with 1000, followed by `n-1` elements, each computed as the previous element minus the corresponding value in `T`, and `result` is now a string containing the elements of the list `a` joined by spaces, and the value of `line` is updated to the new input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `line = input('')` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. This changes the value of `line` to the new input provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
