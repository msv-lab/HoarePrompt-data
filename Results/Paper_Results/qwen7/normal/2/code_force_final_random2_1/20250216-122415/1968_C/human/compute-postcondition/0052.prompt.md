Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and it is the input integer from the user.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
    a = a[::-1]
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `result` is a string containing the string representations of all elements of `a` separated by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 1`, `result` is '1000', `n` must be at least 2, `line` remains as the initial input provided by the user, `T` remains as the list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer, `a` is a list starting with 1000, followed by `n-1` elements, each computed as the previous element minus the corresponding value in `T`, and `result` is now a string containing the elements of the list `a` joined by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The list `a` is reversed; `result` is a string containing the elements of the reversed list `a` separated by spaces.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
