Output State: **`t` is 0, `result` is a string containing the elements of the list `a` joined by spaces, `n` is an input integer, `line` is the new input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer, `a` is a list starting with 1000, followed by `n-1` elements, each computed as the previous element minus the corresponding value in `T`.**

Explanation: The given code snippet does not contain any operations that would change the values of the variables. It only initializes the list `a` with the value 1000. Since no changes are made to the variables, their states remain as described in the initial state.
