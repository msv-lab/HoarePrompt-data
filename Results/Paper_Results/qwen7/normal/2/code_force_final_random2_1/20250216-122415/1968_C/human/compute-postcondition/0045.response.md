Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `a` is updated such that its last element is now the value of the element before the last one minus the value of `T` at the index before the last one.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`, where `i` is the index of the last element in `a`. Since `i` is the last index, `i - 1` refers to the second last element in `a`. The value of `T` at the index `i - 1` is subtracted from the second last element of `a`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
