Output State: **`t` is 0, `result` is '1000', `n` is an input integer, `line` remains as the initial input provided by the user, `T` remains as the list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer, `a` is a list starting with 1000, followed by `n-1` elements, each computed as the previous element minus the corresponding value in `T`, and `result` is now a string containing the elements of the list `a` joined by spaces.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input from the user to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `n` is now an integer input by the user, while the other variables retain their original values as described in the initial state.
