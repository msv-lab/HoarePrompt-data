Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2, `a` contains `n` elements where `a[0]` is `a[0] - T[0]`, `a[1]` is `a[0] - T[0] - T[1]`, and so on until `a[n-1]` which is `a[n-2] - T[n-2]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than `n`, meaning the loop has run `n-1` times. The list `a` will have `n` elements, with each element calculated based on the previous one minus the corresponding value from the list `T`. Specifically, the first element remains as `a[0] - T[0]`, the second element is adjusted by subtracting `T[1]`, and this pattern continues until the last element, which is adjusted by subtracting `T[n-2]`.
