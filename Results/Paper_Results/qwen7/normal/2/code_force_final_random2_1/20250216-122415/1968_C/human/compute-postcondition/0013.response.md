Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2, `a` contains `n` elements where `a[0]` is `a[0] - T[0]`, `a[1]` is `a[0] - T[0] - T[1]`, and so on, with each subsequent element being the previous element minus the corresponding `T[i-1]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than `n`, meaning the loop has run `n-1` times. The list `a` will have `n` elements, starting with `a[0]` as `1000 - T[0]`, and each subsequent element will be the previous element minus the corresponding value from the list `T`.
