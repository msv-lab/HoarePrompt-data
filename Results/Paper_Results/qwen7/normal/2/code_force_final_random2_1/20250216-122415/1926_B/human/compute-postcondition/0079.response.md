Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < t`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if at least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1'. Otherwise, `a` is 0.
   - `b` is 'SQUARE'.
   - `s` holds the last input string processed by the loop.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `n`.

4. **Adjust the State for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to `n + 2`.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - `t` remains the same.

6. **Final State**:
   - `a` remains unchanged: 'TRIANGLE' if at least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1'. Otherwise, `a` is 0.
   - `b` remains 'SQUARE'.
   - `s` remains the last input string processed by the loop.
   - `i` is now `n + 2`.
   - `t` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is 'TRIANGLE' if at least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1'. Otherwise, `a` is 0. `b` is 'SQUARE', `s` holds the last input string processed by the loop, `i` is `n + 2`, and `t` is the same as before.**
