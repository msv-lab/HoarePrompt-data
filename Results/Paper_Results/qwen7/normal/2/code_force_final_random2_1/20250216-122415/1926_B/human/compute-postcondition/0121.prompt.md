You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the input consists of n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0
        
        b = ''
        
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `t`, which is the total number of iterations the loop was supposed to run. The variable `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' if at least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1'. Otherwise, `a` will be 0. The variable `b` will be 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings contained more than one '1'. If no input string contained exactly one '1' or more than one '1', `b` will remain its last assigned value, which could be 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE'. The variable `j` will be equal to `n - 1` for the last iteration, but since the loop has completed, `j` will not be incremented further. The variable `s` will hold the last input string processed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of characters consisting of '0' and '1'. The grid has n rows and n columns where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and it contains exactly one triangle or one square made up of '1's. The function determines whether the shape formed by '1's is a triangle or a square and returns the result accordingly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
