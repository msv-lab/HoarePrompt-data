Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the input consists of n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0
        
        b = ''
        
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `t`, which is the total number of iterations the loop was supposed to run. The variable `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' if at least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1'. Otherwise, `a` will be 0. The variable `b` will be 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings contained more than one '1'. If no input string contained exactly one '1' or more than one '1', `b` will remain its last assigned value, which could be 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE'. The variable `j` will be equal to `n - 1` for the last iteration, but since the loop has completed, `j` will not be incremented further. The variable `s` will hold the last input string processed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of '0's and '1's with dimensions n x n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10). For each test case, it checks if the '1's form a triangle or a square. If at least one row contains exactly one '1', it prints 'TRIANGLE'. If any row contains more than one '1', it prints 'SQUARE'. If neither condition is met, it prints the last determined shape type (which could be 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE').
