Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n - 1`, where `n` is greater than 0.
- `b` is either 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings contain more than one '1', or remains unchanged if all input strings contain exactly one '1'.
- `s` is updated to the new input string after the last iteration.
- The current value of `a` is not 0.

The `print(a)` statement will print the value of `a`.

Since the value of `a` is explicitly stated to be not 0, we can directly use this information.

Output: **a (where a is not 0)**
