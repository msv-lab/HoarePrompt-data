Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `s` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'SQUARE'` to the variable `b`. Since the initial state of `b` was unchanged if `s` contained exactly one '1', and now `b` is explicitly set to `'SQUARE'`, this condition is met regardless of the content of `s`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and `s` is still an input string.
