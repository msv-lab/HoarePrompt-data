The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of '0's and '1's with dimensions n x n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10). For each test case, it checks if the '1's form a triangle or a square. If at least one row contains exactly one '1', it prints 'TRIANGLE'. If any row contains more than one '1', it prints 'SQUARE'. If neither condition is met, it prints the last determined shape type (which could be 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE').
