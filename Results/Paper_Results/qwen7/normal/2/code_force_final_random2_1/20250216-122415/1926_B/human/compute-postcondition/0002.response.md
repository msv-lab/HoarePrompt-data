State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `i` is 0**

### Explanation:
1. **Identify Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains two variables: `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for i in range(t)` will execute if `t` is a positive integer and its value is within the range [1, 100].
3. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function.
4. **Adjusting States**: Since `t` determines the number of iterations, it must be within the specified range to ensure the loop executes. The initial value of `i` is automatically set to 0 by the `range()` function.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is within the valid range and `i` is set to 0.
