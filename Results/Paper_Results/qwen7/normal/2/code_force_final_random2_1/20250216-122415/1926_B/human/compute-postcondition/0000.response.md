Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `t` is equal to the integer input, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial condition for `t` is that it is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. After executing the code, `t` retains this property and is set to the specific integer input provided. The value of `n` remains unchanged and still falls within the range 2 to 10, as no code has been provided to modify `n` yet.
