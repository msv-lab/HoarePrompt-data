Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `j = 0` to `j < n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `b` contains exactly one '1'.
   - Otherwise, `a` is 0.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `b` is either 'SQUARE' or a string where the count of '1' is not equal to 1.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become `1`.

4. **Check the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < n`. Since `j` is being incremented from 0 to 1, the loop will execute again if `1 < n`.

5. **Adjust the states**: We need to update the state of `j` to `1`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `b`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `b` contains exactly one '1'. Otherwise, `a` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or a string where the count of '1' is not equal to 1.**
