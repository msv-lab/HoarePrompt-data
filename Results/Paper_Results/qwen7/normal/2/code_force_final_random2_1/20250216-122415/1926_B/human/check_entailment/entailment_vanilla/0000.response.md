### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.

2. **Checking for Triangle or Square:**
   - The program initializes two variables: `a` and `b`.
   - `a` is used to store the result if a triangle is detected.
   - `b` is used to store the result if a square is detected.
   - For each row in the grid, it counts the number of '1's.
     - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
     - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Determining the Shape:**
   - After processing all rows, the program checks the value of `a`.
     - If `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE', it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Logic for Detecting Shapes:**
   - The logic for detecting a triangle or square is flawed.
   - The program only checks if any row has exactly one '1' or more than one '1'. This does not correctly identify the shapes.
   - For example, a triangle with multiple rows will have some rows with more than one '1', but this does not mean the entire shape is a square.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Rows:**
   - The program does not check if the '1's form a consistent pattern for a triangle or square across multiple rows.
   - For instance, a triangle with `k=3` would have rows like `11`, `111`, `11`. The program would incorrectly identify this as a square because some rows have more than one '1'.

3. **No Validation for Consistent Patterns:**
   - The program does not validate if the '1's form a consistent triangular or square pattern throughout the grid.

### Conclusion:

Given these issues, the program does not correctly identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
