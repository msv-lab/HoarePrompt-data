Output State: **`a` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n`, `b` is an empty string, `s` holds the last input string processed by the loop.**

The code `b = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `b`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `i`, `j`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
