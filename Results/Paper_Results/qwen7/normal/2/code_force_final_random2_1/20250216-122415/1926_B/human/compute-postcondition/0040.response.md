Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` and `b` will be either 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' based on the conditions given, `j` is `n`, and `s` holds the last input string processed by the loop.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, `j`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
