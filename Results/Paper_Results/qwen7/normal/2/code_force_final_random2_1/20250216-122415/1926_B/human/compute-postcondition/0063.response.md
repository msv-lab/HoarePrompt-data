Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `b` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - The value of `s` and `b` remains unchanged or `b` becomes 'SQUARE' if `s.count('1') == 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - Since `i` is `n + 1` and does not change within the loop, it remains the same.
   - `b` can either remain unchanged or become 'SQUARE' if `s.count('1') == 1`. However, since the loop head does not depend on `s` or `b`, their values do not need to be adjusted here.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `a` remains the same as it was determined based on `b` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` remains `n + 1`.
   - `j` is now 2.
   - `b` remains unchanged or becomes 'SQUARE' depending on `s`, but this is not part of the loop head adjustment.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `b` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 2, and `b` remains unchanged or becomes 'SQUARE' if `s.count('1') == 1**.
