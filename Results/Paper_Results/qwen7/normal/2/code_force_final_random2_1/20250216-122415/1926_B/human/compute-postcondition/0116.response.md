Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n - 1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `b` remains unchanged if all input strings contain exactly one '1'
- `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings contain more than one '1'
- `s` is updated to the new input string after the last iteration

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the conditions for `b`:

1. If all input strings contain exactly one '1', then `b` remains unchanged from its previous value.
2. If any input string contains more than one '1', then `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.

Since the exact value of `b` is not explicitly stated in the initial state, we need to infer it based on the conditions. However, the problem does not provide the actual input strings, so we cannot definitively determine the exact value of `b`.

Given the conditions, `b` could either be its original value (if all strings have exactly one '1') or 'SQUARE' (if any string has more than one '1'). Since the exact value is not specified, we can only describe it based on the conditions.

Output: **b (where b is either the original value if all input strings contain exactly one '1', or 'SQUARE' if any input string contains more than one '1')**
