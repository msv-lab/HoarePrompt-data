Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `ans` will be the sum of the following two components:**

1. The total count of 0s in the list `s` (stored in `zeroes`).
2. For each non-zero element `c` in the list `s`, `ans` is incremented by the difference between `zeroes` and the count of 0s up to that point (`cnt[0]`).

In simpler terms, `ans` will be the total number of zeros in the list plus, for each non-zero element, the number of zeros that have appeared before it in the list.
