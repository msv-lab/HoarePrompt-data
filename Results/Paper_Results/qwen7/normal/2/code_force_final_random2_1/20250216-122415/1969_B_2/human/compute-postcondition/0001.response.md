State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head: The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable and `range(n)` to determine the number of iterations. The key variable here is `n`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute: For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer because `range(n)` will generate a sequence of integers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. Note the other variable `t`: The variable `t` is mentioned but does not affect the loop's execution condition. It is given that `t` is an integer within a specific range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), but this information is not relevant to ensuring the loop runs.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that `n` must be greater than 0.
