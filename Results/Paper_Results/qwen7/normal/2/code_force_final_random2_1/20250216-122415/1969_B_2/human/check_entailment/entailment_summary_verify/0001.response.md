### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires transforming a binary string into a sorted (non-descending) order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The goal is to minimize the total cost of these operations, where the cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the shifted substring.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeroes in the string (`zeroes`).
   - It initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string and calculates the answer (`ans`) based on certain conditions.

3. **Key Issues Identified**:
   - The code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost of sorting the string via cyclic shifts.
   - The logic inside the loop does not accurately reflect the cost calculation for cyclic shifts.
   - The approach used in the code does not align with the problem requirements.

4. **Expected Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to identify the breakpoints in the string where the sequence changes from 0s to 1s.
   - For each breakpoint, the cost to sort the string can be calculated as the sum of the lengths of the segments between these breakpoints.
   - The total cost would be the sum of the lengths of these segments minus the length of the string plus one (since the entire string can be considered as one segment).

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Identify the indices where the string changes from 0 to 1.
   - Calculate the cost as the sum of the lengths of these segments.

6. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The provided function summary states that the function processes multiple test cases and calculates a value based on the counts of zeros and ones in the string. However, this summary does not match the actual implementation of the function, which does not correctly compute the required cost.

7. **Validation**:
   - Given the discrepancy between the expected approach and the actual implementation, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as per the given requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
