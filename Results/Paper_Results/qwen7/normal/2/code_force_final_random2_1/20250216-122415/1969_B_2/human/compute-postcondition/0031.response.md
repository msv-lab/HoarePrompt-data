Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the two components, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[0, 0]`**.

The code initializes a list `cnt` with two zeros. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `n`, or `zeroes`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
