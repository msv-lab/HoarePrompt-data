Postcondition: `ans` is either 1 or `2 * (zeroes - cnt[0]) + (zeroes - cnt[0])`, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s` (without its first element and second element), `cnt` is `[1, 2]`, `c` is the third element of `s`. If `c` is 0, then `ans` is either 2 or `2 * (zeroes - cnt[0]) + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or `2 * (zeroes - cnt[0]) + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.
