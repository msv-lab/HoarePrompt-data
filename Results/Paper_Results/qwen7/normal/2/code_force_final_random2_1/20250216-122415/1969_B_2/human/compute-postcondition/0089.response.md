Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). For each test case, the function returns either a specific value or an error message if the conditions on `t` and `s` are not met.**
