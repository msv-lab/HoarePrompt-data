Output State: **`s` is not empty; `c` is the next character in `s`; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `zeroes - cnt[0]`. The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and the other variables (`s`, `c`, `zeroes`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
