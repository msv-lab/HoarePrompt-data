Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[1, 0]`, `s` must have at least one element, `c` is the first element of `s`**.

Explanation: The code increments the count of the first element `c` in the list `cnt`. Since `cnt` was initially `[0, 0]`, after executing `cnt[c] += 1`, the value of `cnt` changes to `[1, 0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
