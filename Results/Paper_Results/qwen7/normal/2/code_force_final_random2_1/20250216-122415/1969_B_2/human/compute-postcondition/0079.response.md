Postcondition: `s` is not empty; `c` is the next character in `s`; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1; `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0 before the increment, otherwise `ans` remains 0; if `cnt[0]` was greater than 0 before the increment, `ans` is further incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`, where `zeroes` is the number of occurrences of character '0' in `cnt` before the increment.
