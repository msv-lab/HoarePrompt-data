Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `res` is 'peak', and `i` must be less than or equal to 1000.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'peak'` to the variable `res`. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `i` must be less than or equal to 1000 also remains valid.
