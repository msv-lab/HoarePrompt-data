Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive; `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `y = randint(1, 9)` generates a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and assigns it to the variable `y`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
