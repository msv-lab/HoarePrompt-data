Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive; `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive; `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive; `res` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `res` as an empty string. Since the values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `z` were not affected by this line of code, they remain as they were in the initial state.
