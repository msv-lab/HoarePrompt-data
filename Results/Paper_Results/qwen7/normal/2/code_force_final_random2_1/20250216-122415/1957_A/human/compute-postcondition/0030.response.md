Output State: **`palka` has at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `pl` now contains the element `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Before this operation, `i` is the third element in `palka`. If `i` was not already in `pl`, it is added to `pl`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
