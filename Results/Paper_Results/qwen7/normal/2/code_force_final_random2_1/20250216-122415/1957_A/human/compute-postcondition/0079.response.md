Postcondition: `palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `palka` list, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` now contains the value `i`. Furthermore, if the second element of the original `palka` is not in `d`, then `d` now contains the key-value pair `{second_element_of_palka: 1}`, otherwise `d[second_element_of_palka]` is incremented by 1.
