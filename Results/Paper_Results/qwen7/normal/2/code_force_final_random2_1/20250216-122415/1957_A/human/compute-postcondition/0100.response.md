Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the variable `j` which is iterated over the elements in `pl`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `pl` and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `shapes` is 2.
   - `pl` must have at least one element.
   - The current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, where `j` is the next element in `pl`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` is the next element in `pl`, after the previous iteration, `j` has been processed.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `pl` must still have at least one element, and the next value of `d[j]` (which is now the next element in `pl`) must be greater than or equal to 3.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `shapes` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `pl` must now have at least one remaining element (since one element was processed).
   - The next value of `d[j]` must be greater than or equal to 3, where `j` is now the next element in `pl`.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `shapes` is 2, `pl` must have at least one remaining element, and the next value of `d[j]` must be greater than or equal to 3, where `j` is the next element in `pl`**.
