Postcondition: `palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `palka` list, and `d` is a dictionary. If the second element of the original `palka` is not in `d`, then `d` now contains the key-value pair `{second_element_of_palka: 1}`. If the second element of the original `palka` is already in `d`, then `d[second_element_of_palka]` is incremented by 1.
