Output State: **`d[j]` is an integer, shapes is increased by 1 if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is the next index in `pl`**.

Explanation: The code `shapes += 1` increments the value of `shapes` by 1. Whether `shapes` was previously the same as its previous value or increased by 1 if `d[j]` was greater than or equal to 3, it is now increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
