Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being `i`, `d` now contains either the key-value pair `{i: 1}` if `i` was not previously in `d`, or `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, and `pl` is a list with the first element being `i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `i` is the first element of `palka` and `d` already contains the key-value pair based on the initial state, appending `i` to `pl` does not change the conditions regarding `d` or `palka`. Therefore, `pl` now includes `i` as its first element.
