Based on the initial state provided:

- `pl` is a list that has been processed.
- `shapes` is the total count of elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

The `print(shapes)` statement will print the value of `shapes`.

To determine what `shapes` is, we need to know how many elements in `pl` meet the condition `d[j] >= 3`. Since the exact elements of `pl` and `d` are not provided, we cannot give a specific numerical value for `shapes`. However, we can describe it as the count of such elements.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the count of elements j in pl where d[j] is greater than or equal to 3)**
