Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `pl`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `pl`. For each iteration, it checks if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, and if so, it increments `shapes` by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d[j]` is an integer.
   - If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `j` will be incremented by 1 (assuming `pl` is a sequence like a list and `j` is an index).
   - The variable `shapes` might or might not be incremented depending on the value of `d[j]`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` will be the next index in `pl`.
   - `shapes` will either remain the same or increase by 1 based on the value of `d[j]`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `j` will be the next index in `pl`.
- `shapes` will either remain the same or increase by 1 based on the value of `d[j]`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `d[j]` for the next iteration, we can only say that `shapes` could be incremented by 1 if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`d[j]` is an integer, `shapes` is either the same as the previous value or increased by 1 if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is the next index in `pl`**.
