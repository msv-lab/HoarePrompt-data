Output State: **`ln` is an input integer, `shapes` is the total count of elements in `palka` that have a count of occurrences of 3 or more in the list `palka`, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, the remaining number of iterations `w` is `w - 1`, `palka` is updated to a list of integers from user input.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary `d`. This does not affect the values of `ln`, `shapes`, `pl`, `w`, or `palka`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state. The only change is the creation of the dictionary `d`, which is now an empty dictionary.
