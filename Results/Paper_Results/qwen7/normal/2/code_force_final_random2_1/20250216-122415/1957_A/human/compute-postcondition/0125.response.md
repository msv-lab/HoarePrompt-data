Output State: **`palka` has at least one element, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` is mapped to the value 1, and `i` is an element in `palka`.**

This means that the dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`, while the other elements in `palka` and the dictionary `d` (excluding the new entry) remain unchanged from the initial state.
