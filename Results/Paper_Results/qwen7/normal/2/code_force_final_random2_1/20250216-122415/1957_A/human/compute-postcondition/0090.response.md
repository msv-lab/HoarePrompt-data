Output State: **`shapes` is 0**

The code initializes the variable `shapes` to 0. No other variables are affected, and the precondition that all elements in `palka` have been processed, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`. The list `pl` contains all unique elements from `palka` remains unchanged.
