### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It also correctly reads the number of sticks (`n`) and the lengths of the sticks (`arr`).

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary. This step is correct and ensures that we know how many sticks of each length we have.

3. **Polygon Formation**: The program attempts to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by summing up the integer division of each frequency by 4. This logic is flawed because it assumes that each polygon must have exactly 4 sides, which is not true. The problem statement does not specify the number of sides of the polygons; they can be triangles, squares, pentagons, etc., as long as each side is formed by exactly one stick and no stick is reused.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the result for each test case, but the logic for determining the number of polygons is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem statement, the program should consider forming polygons with different numbers of sides (triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, etc.) and count the maximum number of such polygons that can be formed without reusing any sticks.

### Correctness:

**False**

The program is incorrect because it incorrectly assumes that each polygon must have 4 sides and uses integer division by 4 to determine the number of polygons, which does not account for polygons with different numbers of sides.
