Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100; `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This does not affect the values of the elements in the list `arr`. Therefore, the list `arr` remains unchanged, and the only new information is that `freq` is now an empty dictionary.
