Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary, and `pl` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. The initial conditions of `palka` and `d` remain unchanged, and now `pl` contains the value of `i`.
