Output State: **`palka` has at least one element (second element), `i` is the second element in `palka`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1, `pl` and `d` will be adjusted based on whether `i` is in `pl`**.

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. The value of `i` is the second element in `palka`. The conditions for adjusting `pl` and `d` based on whether `i` is in `pl` remain unchanged.
