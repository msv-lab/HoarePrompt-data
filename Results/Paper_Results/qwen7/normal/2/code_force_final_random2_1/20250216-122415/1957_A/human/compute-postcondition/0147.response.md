Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in pl:`. This means the variables `j` and `pl` are the only ones that can be adjusted.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `shapes` is 1
   - `j` is 1
   - The current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `pl` to iterate over.
   - Since `j` is currently 1, the next value of `j` would be the next element in `pl`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented to the next value in `pl`.
   - The condition `d[j] >= 3` must still hold true for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `j` is incremented to the next value in `pl`.
- `d[j]` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

Since the exact values of `pl` and `d` are not provided, we can only update `j` and ensure the condition holds.

**State:**
**`shapes` is 1, `j` is 2, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3** (assuming `pl` has at least two elements and the condition holds for `j = 2`).

If `pl` has fewer than two elements, the loop would terminate, but based on the given information, we assume it continues.
