Output State: **`palka` has at least one element, `d` is a dictionary, and `d[i]` is increased by 1 if `d[i]` was not None.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `palka`. However, the question does not specify what `pl` is, so I assume it is a typo and should be `palka`. The postcondition also mentions `d` and `i`, but does not specify any changes to `palka`. Since `palka` has at least one element initially and the code only appends `i` to `palka`, `palka` will now have at least two elements. For the dictionary `d`, if the key `i` exists and is not `None`, its value is increased by 1. If `d[i]` was `None`, it remains unchanged.
