Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `palka` list, and `d` is a dictionary. Now, `pl` is a list containing the value `i`, and if the second element of the original `palka` is not in `d`, then `d` now contains the key-value pair `{second_element_of_palka: 1}`, otherwise `d[second_element_of_palka]` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the list `pl` has been appended with the value `i`, and the dictionary `d` has been updated based on whether the second element of the original `palka` list is already a key in `d`.
