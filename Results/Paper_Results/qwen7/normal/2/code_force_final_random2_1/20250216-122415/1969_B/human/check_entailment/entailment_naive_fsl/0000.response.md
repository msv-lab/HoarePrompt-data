Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The provided solution does not account for the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts, which is the length of the substring being shifted. Instead, it seems to be counting something else, likely the number of 0s and transitions between 0s and 1s, but this does not align with the problem description.

For example, consider the input "101011":
- The correct approach would involve identifying the minimum cost to sort the string through cyclic shifts. One optimal strategy could be:
  1. Choose the substring [3, 5]: "101011" → "101101" (cost = 3).
  2. Choose the substring [4, 6]: "101101" → "100111" (cost = 3).
  3. Choose the substring [2, 3]: "100111" → "001111" (cost = 2).
  4. Choose the substring [1, 1]: "001111" → "000111" (cost = 1).

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9, which matches the expected output.

However, the provided program does not implement this logic and instead appears to be counting transitions or something similar, which does not match the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
