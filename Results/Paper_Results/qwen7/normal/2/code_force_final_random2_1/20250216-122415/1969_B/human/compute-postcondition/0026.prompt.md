Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `cnt` is [0, 0], `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list, `c` is the first element in the list `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1 in the if case, and `ans` is increased by the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` in the else case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list starting from the second element, `c` is the first element in the updated list `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by either 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, or by the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list starting from the third element, `c` is the first element in the updated list `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by either 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, or by the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`, regardless of whether `c` is 0 or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
