Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 0, `s` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input.
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is not empty, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0 and `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0 and `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is not empty; `c` is the next character in `s`; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1; `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0 before the increment, otherwise `ans` remains 0; if `cnt[0]` was greater than 0 before the increment, `ans` is further incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`, where `zeroes` is the number of occurrences of character '0' in `cnt` before the increment.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is not empty, `c` is the next character in `s`, `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, and `ans` is 1 if `cnt[0]` was greater than 0 before the increment, otherwise `ans` is 0, or `ans` is `ans` plus the number of zeroes minus `cnt[0]` after the increment.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
