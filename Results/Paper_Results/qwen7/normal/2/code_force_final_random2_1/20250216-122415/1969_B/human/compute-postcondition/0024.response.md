Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list starting from the third element, `c` is the first element in the updated list `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by either 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, or by the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`, regardless of whether `c` is 0 or not.
