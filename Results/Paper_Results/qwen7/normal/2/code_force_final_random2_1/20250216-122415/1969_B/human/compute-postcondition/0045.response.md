Output State: **`ans` is either 1 or `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s` (without its first element), `cnt` is `[1, 1]`, `s` must have at least one element, and `c` is the second element of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of `c` in the list `cnt`. Initially, `cnt` is `[1, 0]`, meaning `cnt[0]` is 1 and `cnt[1]` is 0. Since `c` is the second element of `s`, `c` is 1. Therefore, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, making `cnt` equal to `[1, 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
