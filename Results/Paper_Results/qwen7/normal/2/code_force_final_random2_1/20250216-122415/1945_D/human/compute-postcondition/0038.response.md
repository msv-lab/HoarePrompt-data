Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n - k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = n - k` to `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n - k` is 0
   - `soma_b` is equal to `lista_B[0]`
   - `resultado` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `(pref + lista_B[0] + lista_A[0])`

4. **Determine if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given `i` is currently 1 and `n - k` is 0, we need to check if `n` is greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `n - k` is 0, it implies `n` is equal to `k`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `n - k` remains 0.

6. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n - k` is still 0
   - `soma_b` remains equal to `lista_B[0]`
   - `resultado` remains assigned the minimum value between its current value and `(pref + lista_B[0] + lista_A[0])`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n - k` is 0, `soma_b` is equal to `lista_B[0]`, `resultado` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `(pref + lista_B[0] + lista_A[0])`**
