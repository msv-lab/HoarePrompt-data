Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - k, n)`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over the range from `n - k` to `n-1` (inclusive). This means `i` will take values from `n - k` to `n - 1`.
3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` will be `n - k - 1`. This means the loop will start with `i = n - k - 1` and increment `i` until it reaches `n - 1`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing with the correct initial value of `i` and that the range condition is satisfied.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `n - k - 1`. For the loop to start, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.
2. **Range Condition**: The range `range(n - k, n)` ensures that `i` starts from `n - k` and goes up to `n - 1`. Therefore, `n - k` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`, which is always true since `k` is a non-negative integer.

### Adjusted States:

- `i` should be `n - k - 1` to start the loop.
- `n - k` should be less than or equal to `n - 1` to ensure the loop can start.

Since `n - k` is already given as 0, we can infer that `n - k = 0` implies `n = k`. However, the loop will still start with `i = n - k - 1 = k - 1`.

### Final State:

State: **`resultado` is set to infinity, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `n - k` is 0, `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B`, and `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing with the correct initial value of `i` and that the range condition is satisfied.
