Output State: **`i` is 3, `n - k` is 0, `soma_b` is equal to `lista_B[0]`, `resultado` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `(pref + lista_B[0] + lista_A[0])`**

Explanation: The code updates the `resultado` variable to be the minimum of its current value and the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` was 2, so after the operation, `i` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged as no new values are assigned to them.
