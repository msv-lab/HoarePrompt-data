Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - k)`. The variables involved here are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `n - k` is a positive integer.
   - `soma_b` is the sum of elements from `lista_B` up to the index `i-1` if `i` is 1, otherwise `soma_b` is 0.
   - If `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]` when `i` is 1, then `pref` is equal to `soma_b` + `lista_A[0]`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(n - k)`, `i` will increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be 1 if it was 0, or 2 if it was 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will change from 0 or 1 to 1 or 2 respectively.
   - `n - k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `soma_b` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `pref` will be updated if the condition `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` is met when `i` is 1.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- If `i` was 0, it will become 1.
- If `i` was 1, it will become 2.
- `n - k` remains the same.
- `soma_b` will be updated to the sum of elements from `lista_B` up to the index `i-1` (which is now 0 or 1).
- `pref` will be updated if the condition is met.

Since we don't know the exact values of `lista_A` and `lista_B`, we'll keep the conditions general.

### Updated States:
- If `i` was 0, then `i` becomes 1.
- If `i` was 1, then `i` becomes 2.
- `n - k` remains the same.
- `soma_b` is updated to the sum of elements from `lista_B` up to the index `i-1` (0 or 1).
- `pref` is updated if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` when `i` is 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `n - k` is a positive integer, `soma_b` is the sum of elements from `lista_B` up to the index `i-1` (0 or 1), and `pref` is updated if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` when `i` is 1.**
