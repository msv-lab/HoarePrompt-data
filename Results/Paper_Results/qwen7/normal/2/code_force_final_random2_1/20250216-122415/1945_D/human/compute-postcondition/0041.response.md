Output State: **`i` is `n - k`, `n - k` is 0, `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B` from index 0 to `n - k`, and `resultado` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `(pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])` for every `i` in the range `[n - k, n)`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - k`, `n - k` remains 0, `soma_b` will be the cumulative sum of all elements in `lista_B` from the start up to the last element included in the loop, and `resultado` will hold the minimum value it was assigned during any iteration of the loop, which is the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]` for each `i` in the specified range.
