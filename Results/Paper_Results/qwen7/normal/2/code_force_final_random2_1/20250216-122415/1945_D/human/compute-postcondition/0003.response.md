Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(numero_testes):`. The only variable involved here is `numero_testes`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `numero_testes` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: `func_1()` has been called.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must be greater than 0. Since `func_1()` has been called, it implies that `numero_testes` was initially set to some positive value. After one iteration, `numero_testes` would be decremented by 1 (assuming it is decremented in the loop body).

5. **State Adjustment**: Therefore, `numero_testes` should be adjusted to reflect that it has been decremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`func_1()` has been called, `numero_testes` must be greater than 0**.
