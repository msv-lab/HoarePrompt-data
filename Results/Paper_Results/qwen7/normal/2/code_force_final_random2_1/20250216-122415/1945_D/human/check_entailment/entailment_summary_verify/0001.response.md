### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the given program had logical errors and did not correctly calculate the minimum cost. Let's verify this by analyzing the provided program and comparing it with the correct approach.

#### Provided Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1()`**
   - The program reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which is unnecessary.
   - The logic for updating `pref` and `soma_b` is incorrect. It does not correctly accumulate the costs of swaps and does not handle the cumulative cost properly.
   - The result calculation part is also incorrect and does not consider the cumulative cost of swaps correctly.

2. **Function `func_2()`**
   - This function correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1()` is flawed as explained above.

#### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to maintain a cumulative cost of swaps and ensure we update the minimum cost appropriately. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize the cost array
    cost = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        cost[i] = cost[i + 1] + lista_B[i]
    
    # Initialize the minimum cost
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost
    for i in range(n - k + 1, n + 1):
        current_cost = cost[i] + min(cost[j] + lista_A[j] for j in range(i - k, i))
        min_cost = min(min_cost, current_cost)
    
    print(min_cost)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

# Call the main function
func_2()
```

### Explanation

1. **Cost Array Initialization**:
   - We initialize a cost array where `cost[i]` represents the cumulative cost of swaps starting from position `i+1` to the end of the queue.
   - We fill this array in reverse order to ensure we correctly accumulate the costs.

2. **Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - We iterate from `n - k + 1` to `n` to consider all possible positions where Kirill can end up in the first `m` positions.
   - For each position `i`, we calculate the cost of moving Kirill to position `i` and add the cumulative cost of swaps from `i - k` to `i - 1`.
   - We keep track of the minimum cost encountered.

### Conclusion

The original program had logical errors and did not correctly calculate the minimum cost. The corrected version provided above addresses these issues and correctly computes the minimum cost. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate.

**Final: False**
