You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and a list of n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.

    #State: Output State: `func_1()` has been called `numero_testes` times.
    #
    #Explanation: Since the loop runs `numero_testes` times and `func_1()` is called in each iteration, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `func_1()` will have been called exactly `numero_testes` times. The value of `numero_testes` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once, as stated in the given conditions. Therefore, after all iterations, `func_1()` will have been called `numero_testes` times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not properly handle the conditions specified in the problem description.

The problem requires finding the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions in the queue. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the costs for moving Kirill to different positions. Instead, it seems to be attempting to reverse the lists and then calculate some form of prefix sums, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - The minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first 2 positions is calculated as follows:
    - Moving from position 4 to position 3: Cost = 5 (b_3)
    - Moving from position 3 to position 2: Cost = 3 (b_2)
    - Moving from position 2 to position 1: Cost = 3 (a_1)
    - Total cost = 5 + 3 + 3 = 11

- **Actual Output:**
  - The provided solution outputs 14, which is incorrect.

The provided solution does not correctly account for the costs associated with each move and does not ensure that the minimum cost is calculated accurately. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
