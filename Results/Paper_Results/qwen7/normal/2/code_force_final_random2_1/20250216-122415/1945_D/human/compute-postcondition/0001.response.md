Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop index) and the variable `numero_testes`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `numero_testes`**: According to the problem statement, `numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq numero_testes \leq 10^4\), and it is initialized by reading an integer from input.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `numero_testes` is greater than 0. If `numero_testes` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop will iterate based on the value of `numero_testes`, we need to ensure that `numero_testes` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The initial value of `numero_testes` is set by reading an integer from input, but we need to ensure that this value is valid for the loop to proceed.

5. **Final State**: Given that the loop will execute as long as `numero_testes` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `numero_testes` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `numero_testes` must be greater than 0.

**State:**
**`numero_testes` must be greater than 0**
