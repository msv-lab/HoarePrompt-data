Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n - k` is a positive integer, `soma_b` is the sum of elements from `lista_B` up to the index `i`, `pref` is updated by adding `lista_A[i]` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `pref` by adding the value of `lista_A[i]` to its current value. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `lista_A[i]` will be the element at index 2 or 3 in the list `lista_A`. The values of `n - k`, `soma_b`, and `i` remain unchanged.
