Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `n - k` is a positive integer; `soma_b` is the sum of elements from `lista_B` up to the index `i-1` (0 or 1); `pref` is updated by adding `soma_b` to its current value and then adding `lista_A[i]` to it.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `pref` by adding `lista_A[i]` to its current value. Since `i` is either 1 or 2, `lista_A[i]` will be `lista_A[1]` if `i` is 1, or `lista_A[2]` if `i` is 2. The values of `n - k`, `soma_b`, and `i` remain unchanged.
