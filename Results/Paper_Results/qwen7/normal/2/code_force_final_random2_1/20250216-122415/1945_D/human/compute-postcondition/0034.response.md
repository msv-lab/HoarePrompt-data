Output State: **`soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B` plus `lista_B[i]`, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `n - k` is 0, and `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `soma_b += lista_B[i]` adds the value of `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - k - 1` and `n - k` is 0, which means `i` is -1. Since `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, this condition is still valid. However, since list indices cannot be negative in Python, this line of code effectively does nothing because `lista_B[-1]` would refer to the last element of `lista_B`, but `i` is -1, which is out of bounds for a non-empty list. Therefore, `soma_b` remains unchanged, and the only updated information is that `soma_b` now includes the addition of `lista_B[i]` (which is effectively zero in this context).
