You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000; lista_A is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; lista_B is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n - k - 1`, `n - k` will be 0 (since `i` reaches the end of the range), `soma_b` will be the sum of all elements in `lista_B`, and `pref` will be updated based on the conditions inside the loop.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: `i` is `n - k`, `n - k` is 0, `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B` from index 0 to `n - k`, and `resultado` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `(pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])` for every `i` in the range `[n - k, n)`.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: resultado (where resultado is the minimum value between its current value and (pref + soma_b + lista_A[0]))
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters n and k, both positive integers with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000. Additionally, it accepts two lists, lista_A and lista_B, each containing n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns a value based on the comparison and manipulation of elements from these lists according to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
