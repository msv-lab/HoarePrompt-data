Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Reverse Order of Lists**: The code reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`. This is incorrect because the problem requires processing the queue from the beginning to the end, not in reverse order.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `soma_b` and `pref`**: The variables `soma_b` and `pref` are used incorrectly. These variables should accumulate costs in the forward direction, not in reverse.

3. **Logic for Minimizing Cost**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly handle the cumulative cost of bribing people and moving Kirill to an earlier position.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to process the queue from the beginning to the end, keeping track of the cumulative cost of bribing people and moving Kirill to an earlier position. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize variables
    total_cost = 0
    cost_b = 0
    
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            total_cost += cost_b + lista_A[i]
            cost_b = 0
        else:
            cost_b += lista_B[i]
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost to move to one of the first k positions
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        min_cost = min(min_cost, total_cost + cost_b + lista_A[i])
        cost_b += lista_B[i]
    
    print(min_cost)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

func_2()
```

This corrected version processes the queue from the start to the end, correctly accumulating the costs and determining the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `k` positions.
