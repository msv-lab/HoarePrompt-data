Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to maximize the product of two integers \(x\) and \(y\) by swapping their corresponding digits any number of times. The provided code attempts to achieve this by comparing and potentially swapping the digits of \(x\) and \(y\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes no parameters but relies on global variables `a` and `b` which are supposed to be lists of characters representing the digits of `x` and `y`.
   - The function iterates over the digits of `x` and `y` and performs swaps if the digit in `x` is less than the corresponding digit in `y`.
   - After the swaps, it prints the modified `x` and the original `y`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The function uses global variables `a` and `b` which are not defined within the function scope. This means the function cannot operate correctly without these variables being initialized before the function call.
   - The function does not handle the case where `x` and `y` might be of different lengths, although the problem statement guarantees they are of the same length.
   - The function does not return any values, which is fine since the output is printed directly.

4. **Correctness**:
   - Given the current implementation, the function cannot execute as intended because it relies on undefined global variables.
   - The logic inside the function is sound in terms of swapping digits to maximize the product, but it needs to be integrated properly with the input handling.

Since the function cannot run as written due to the use of undefined global variables, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
