Postcondition: `f` is 1, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of characters from the string `x` with one pair of elements swapped, `b` is a list of characters input by the user, the length of `a` is at least 1, and either `a[i]` and `b[i]` have been swapped if `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, or no swap has occurred if `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`.
