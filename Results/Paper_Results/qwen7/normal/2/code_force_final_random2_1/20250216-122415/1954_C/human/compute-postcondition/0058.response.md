Based on the initial state provided:
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `len(a)` must be greater than 1, meaning the list `a` has at least 2 elements.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

Since `i` is 2, we need to access the third element of the list `a` (indexing starts at 0). Given that `a` has at least 2 elements, it must have at least one more element to satisfy the condition `len(a) > 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the third element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[2]**
