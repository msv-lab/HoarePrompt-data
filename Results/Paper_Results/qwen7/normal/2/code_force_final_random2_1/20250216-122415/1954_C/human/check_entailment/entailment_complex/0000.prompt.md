Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `f` is 1, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of characters from the string `x` where at most one pair of elements has been swapped, `b` is a list of characters input by the user, and `i` is the index of the last iteration of the loop. The value of `f` remains 1 because the loop continues as long as `f` is 1, indicating that there was at least one swap during the loop's execution. The list `a` will have at most one pair of elements swapped compared to the corresponding elements in `b`, based on the conditions specified in the loop.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a` minus one, meaning it has iterated through every element in the list. Additionally, the length of the list `a` must be greater than 0 for the loop to have executed even once.
    print()
    #This is printed: ""
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: `i` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, and `len(b)` must be greater than 0.
    print()
    #This is printed: nothing
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as input, each representing an integer of the same length. It then compares the corresponding digits of these strings. If a digit in `x` is smaller than the corresponding digit in `y`, it swaps them. This process continues until either no more swaps are needed or the end of the strings is reached. After the comparisons, it prints the modified string `x` followed by the original string `y`. The function does not return any value.
