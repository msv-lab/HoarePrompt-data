Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is 0.
2. `b` is a list, and it is mentioned that `len(b)` must be greater than 0. This means `b` contains at least one element.
3. The `print` statement accesses the element at index `i` of the list `b` and prints it without a newline (`end=''`).

Given that `i` is 0, the code will print the first element of the list `b`.

Output: **b[0]**
