Postcondition: **`f` is 1, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of characters from the string `x` with one pair of elements swapped, `b` is a list of characters input by the user, the length of `a` is at least 1, and `i` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[i]` is less than or greater than `b[i]`. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` have been swapped.**
