Output State: **`ans` is 0, `s` is a string without the substring 'map'**.

Explanation: The code removes the substring 'map' from the string `s`. Since `s` originally contains the substring 'map', after executing the code, 'map' is removed from `s`. The variable `ans` remains unchanged as it was initialized to 0 and no operations were performed on it.
