Output State: `ans` is 6, `s` is an empty string.

Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in `s`. Each iteration of the loop removes the substring 'pie' from `s` and increments `ans` by 1. After the loop executes 3 times, `s` no longer contains the substring 'pie'. Since the loop condition `s.find('pie') != -1` is no longer satisfied, the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` will be 6 (as it increments by 1 for each successful removal of 'pie'), and `s` will be an empty string because 'pie' was the last substring removed.
