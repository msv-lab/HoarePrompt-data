Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `s.find('map') != -1`. This means the loop continues as long as the substring `'map'` is found in `s`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is 2.
   - `s` is the substring from the start of `s` up to the character right before 'm', followed by the substring from the character right after 'p' to the end of `s`.

3. **Determine What Needs to Change**:
   - For the loop to continue, `s.find('map')` must return a value other than `-1`, meaning `'map'` must still be present in `s`.
   - Since `s` is described as a substring from the start up to 'm' followed by a substring from 'p' to the end, we need to ensure that `s` still contains `'map'`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `s` still contains the substring `'map'`. This means that the part of `s` before 'm' and the part after 'p' combined must still include `'map'`.
   - If `s` no longer contains `'map'`, the loop would terminate.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `s` must still contain the substring `'map'`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `s` includes `'map'`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`ans` is 2, `s` must still contain the substring `'map'`**
