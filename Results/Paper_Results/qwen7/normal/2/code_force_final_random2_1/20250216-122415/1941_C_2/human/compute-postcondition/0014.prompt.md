Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6. The string s is not equal to 'mapie', and the sum of all n lengths across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
while s.find('map') != -1:
    s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
    ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is 1, `s` is a string without the substring 'map'
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `ans` is 2, `s` is the substring from the start of `s` up to the character right before 'm', followed by the substring from the character right after 'p' to the end of `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `ans` is 3, `s` contains the substring 'ma'


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
