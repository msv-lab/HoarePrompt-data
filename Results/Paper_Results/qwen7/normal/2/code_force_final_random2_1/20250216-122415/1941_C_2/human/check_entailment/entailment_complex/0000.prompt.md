Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

    1
    
    p
    
    11
    
    pppiepieeee

Output

    2
    0
    2
    6
    0
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6. The sum of all n lengths across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1(s):
    if (s == 'mapie') :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6. The string s is not equal to 'mapie', and the sum of all n lengths across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 3, `s` is the substring 'ma'.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will have the value 3 because the loop increments `ans` each time it finds and removes the substring 'map'. The final state of `s` will be 'ma' because the loop continues to remove 'map' until it can no longer find it, which leaves only 'ma' in the string.
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 6, `s` is the empty string.
    #
    #Explanation: After analyzing the provided loop and its behavior, we can see that the loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in `s`. Each iteration of the loop removes the substring 'pie' from `s` and increments `ans` by 1. 
    #
    #From the given information:
    #- After the loop executes 1 time, `ans` is 4 and `s` does not contain 'pie'.
    #- After the loop executes 2 times, `ans` is 5 and `s` contains 'pi'.
    #- After the loop executes 3 times, `ans` is 6 and `s` contains the substring from the start to the index right before 'pie' plus the substring from the index right after 'pie' to the end.
    #
    #This means that after 3 iterations, `s` still contains some part of 'pie'. However, since the loop continues to remove 'pie' until it can no longer find it, and `ans` reaches 6 after 3 iterations, it implies that the next iteration would remove the remaining 'pie' from `s`, leaving `s` as an empty string. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` will be 6 and `s` will be the empty string.
    return ans
    #The program returns 6 and s is the empty string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns either 1 or 6. If the string `s` is exactly 'mapie', it returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' and then all occurrences of the substring 'pie', incrementing a counter `ans` for each removal. After processing, if any part of 'pie' remains, `ans` will be 6 and `s` will be an empty string; otherwise, it returns 1.
