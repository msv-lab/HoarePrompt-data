Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is increased by 2, `s` is the value at `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `t` is a positive integer, `index` is increased by 1, and `s` is the value at `data[index]`. The code snippet increments `index` by 1 again, making it increased by 2 in total from its original state. The value of `s` remains dependent on the updated `index` and the `data` list, hence it is the value at `data[index]` which is now `data[index+1]` (previously `data[index]`).
