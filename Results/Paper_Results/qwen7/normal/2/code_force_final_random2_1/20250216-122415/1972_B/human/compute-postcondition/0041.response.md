Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO'.
- `result` is the first element of the `results` list.
- `index` is equal to the total number of elements in the `data` list. However, `data` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `index`.
- `t` is 0.
- `n` and `s` are set according to the last iteration's values, but their values are not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is `print(result)`. Since `result` is the first element of the `results` list, and `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO', the value of `result` will be either 'YES' or 'NO'.

Output: **'YES' or 'NO'**
