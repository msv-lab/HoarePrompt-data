Postcondition: `aa` must have at least `n` elements, `m` must be less than `n`, and `n - m` must be greater than 0. `C[in_aa]` is currently greater than 0, and `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if it was greater than 0, otherwise `pairs_in_D` is reduced by 1, `C[out_aa]` is now equal to `D[out_aa] - 1`, and `D[out_aa]` is equal to -1.
