Based on the initial state described, the `print(fnd)` statement will output the value of `fnd`, which is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`.

To break it down:
- `fnd` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where the condition `pairs_in_D >= k` is true.
- Since the exact number of iterations and the values of `pairs_in_D` and `k` are not specified, `fnd` reflects the total number of times this condition was met during the loop's execution.

Therefore, the output will be the count of iterations where `pairs_in_D` was greater than or equal to `k`.

Output: **fnd (where fnd is the count of iterations where pairs_in_D >= k)**
