Output State: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2; `C[out_aa]` is set to 1; `in_aa` becomes the next element in `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` becomes the next element in `aa[:n - m]`; `E[out_aa]` is reduced by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise `pairs_in_D` is reduced by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `E[in_aa] += 1` increments the value of `E[in_aa]` by 1. No other variables are directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the conditions and changes specified for the other variables remain the same as in the initial state, with the additional change that `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.
