Output State: **`pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `E[in_aa]`, `in_aa`, `out_aa` retain their previous values.**

This means that the value of `C[in_aa]` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables (`D[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `E[in_aa]`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`) remain unchanged from their initial values. The `pairs_in_D` has been incremented by 1 as per the initial state.
