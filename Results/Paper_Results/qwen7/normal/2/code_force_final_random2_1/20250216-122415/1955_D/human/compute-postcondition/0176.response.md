Output State: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2, `C[out_aa]` is set to 1; if `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is set to 0, otherwise `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

This means:
- `fnd` is incremented by 1 only if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `D[out_aa]` is decreased by either 1 or 2, and `C[out_aa]` is set to 1.
- If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is reset to 0. If `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.
