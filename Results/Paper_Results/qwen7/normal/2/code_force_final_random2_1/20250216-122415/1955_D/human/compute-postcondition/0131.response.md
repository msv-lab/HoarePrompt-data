Postcondition: **`fnd` remains unchanged, `pairs_in_D` may decrease by 1, `D[out_aa]` and `D[in_aa]` remain unchanged, `E[out_aa]` and `E[in_aa]` may change as follows: if `E[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. `C[in_aa]` remains unchanged.**
