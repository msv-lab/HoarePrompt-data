Postcondition: `aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `m` is an integer such that `0 <= m < n`, `n - m` is an integer such that `0 <= n - m < n`, `in_aa` is the first element from the slice `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element from the slice `aa[:n - m]`. `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged, `pairs_in_D` remains unchanged, and `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged.
