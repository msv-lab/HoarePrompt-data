Postcondition: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2; `C[out_aa]` is set to 1; `in_aa` becomes the next element in `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` becomes the next element in `aa[:n - m]`; `E[out_aa]` is reduced by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise `pairs_in_D` is reduced by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.
