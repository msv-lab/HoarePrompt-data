Output State: **`D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `fnd` is increased by 1 if either `E[out_aa] > 0` and `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `D[out_aa] > 2` and `pairs_in_D - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `C[in_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of `C[in_aa]` by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
