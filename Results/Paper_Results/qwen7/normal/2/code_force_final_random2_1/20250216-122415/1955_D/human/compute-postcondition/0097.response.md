Postcondition: `aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `m` is an integer such that `0 <= m < n`, `n - m` is an integer such that `0 <= n - m < n`, `in_aa` is the first element from the slice `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element from the slice `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `D[out_aa]` is set to less than or equal to 0, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.
