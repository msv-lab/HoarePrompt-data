Postcondition: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2, and `C[out_aa]` is set to 1. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is set to 0; otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, and `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`.**
