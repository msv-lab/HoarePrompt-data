Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must have at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element, and `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2. Specifically, if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 1`. If `D[out_aa]` was less than or equal to 0, then `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 2` and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0. Additionally, `C[out_aa]` is set to 1. Moreover, `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0.
