Output State: **`cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `aa` is a list of strings containing the split input from the user, `bb` is a list of strings created from the split input.**

The code `cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])` creates a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of the list `aa`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, and `bb` remain unchanged from their initial states.
