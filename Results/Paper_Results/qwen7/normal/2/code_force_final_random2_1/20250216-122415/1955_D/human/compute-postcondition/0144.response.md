Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `fnd` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration where `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, `pairs_in_D` reflects the net difference between matches found and mismatches resolved over all iterations, the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` will adjust based on the operations performed within the loop according to the specified conditions, `nabors` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. These assignments do not affect the other variables (`fnd`, `pairs_in_D`, `D`, `E`, `C`, `nabors`). The conditions and operations related to these variables remain as described in the initial state.
