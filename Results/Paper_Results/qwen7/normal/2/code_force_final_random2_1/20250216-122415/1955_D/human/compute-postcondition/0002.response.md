Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The precondition that `nabors` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and now `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the respective integers from the input.
