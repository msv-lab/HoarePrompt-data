Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is an input integer, and all other variables (t, n, m, k, a, b) retain their initial states.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                pairs_in_D -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            D[in_aa] += 1
            pairs_in_D += 1
            C[in_aa] -= 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, resulting in the following changes:

- The variable `fnd` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration where `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`. Since the loop runs from the `m`-th element of `aa` to the `(n-m)`-th element, the total number of iterations is `n - m`.
- The variable `pairs_in_D` will be adjusted based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, it can be incremented by 1 when `D[in_aa]` is increased, and decremented by 1 when `D[out_aa]` is decreased.
- The dictionaries `C` and `D`, and the Counter `E`, will be updated according to the conditions specified in the loop body. This means that `D[out_aa]` might be decreased, `D[in_aa]` might be increased, `C[in_aa]` and `C[out_aa]` might be updated, and `E[in_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` might be modified.
- The lists `aa` and `nabors`, along with the integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_bb`, and `pairs_in_D`, will retain their initial values as they are not altered by the loop.

In summary, after all iterations of the loop, `fnd` will reflect the number of times `pairs_in_D` was found to be greater than or equal to `k`, and the dictionaries and counters will have been updated according to the loop's conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `fnd` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration where `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `pairs_in_D` may decrease by 1 during each iteration if `E[out_aa]` becomes zero and `D[out_aa]` is decremented. The `D[out_aa]` counter remains unchanged. The `D[in_aa]` counter may increment by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0. The `E[out_aa]` and `E[in_aa]` counters may change based on the conditions within the loop: if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, it decreases by 1; otherwise, `D[out_aa]` decreases by 1 and `C[out_aa]` increases by 1. Similarly, `C[in_aa]` may decrease by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0. All other variables retain their values from the final iteration of the loop.

In summary, `fnd` will reflect the total number of iterations where `pairs_in_D` meets or exceeds `k`, while `pairs_in_D` will reflect the net difference between matches found and mismatches resolved over all iterations. The counters `D`, `E`, and `C` will adjust based on the operations performed within the loop according to the specified conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, resulting in the following changes to the variables:

- `fnd` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, so `fnd` will be incremented by the total number of such iterations.
- `D[out_aa]` will be reduced by either 1 or 2 for each `out_aa` encountered in the loop.
- `C[out_aa]` will be set to 1 for each `out_aa` that was decremented from `D`.
- `D[in_aa]` will be incremented by 1 for each `in_aa` that has a positive count in `C`.
- `C[in_aa]` will be decreased by 1 for each `in_aa` that has a positive count in `C` before the increment operation.
- `E[out_aa]` will be decreased by 1 for each `out_aa` that was decremented from `D` without being decremented from `E`.
- `E[in_aa]` will be incremented by 1 for each `in_aa` that does not have a positive count in `C` and is not already incremented from a previous operation.
- `nabors` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
- The state of `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `E`, `C`, and `k` will reflect the cumulative effects of the loop operations on these variables over all iterations.

In summary, the final state will show the aggregated changes across all iterations of the loop, with `fnd` reflecting whether the condition `pairs_in_D >= k` was met during any iteration, and the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` showing the net effect of the operations performed within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
