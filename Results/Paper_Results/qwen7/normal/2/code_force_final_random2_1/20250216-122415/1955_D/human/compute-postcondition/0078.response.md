Output State: **`cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `aa` is a list of strings containing the split input from the user, `bb` is a list of strings created from the split input, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting the elements of `bb`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt_bb` as a Counter object that counts the elements in the list `bb`. The other variables (`cnt_aa`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, and `bb`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
