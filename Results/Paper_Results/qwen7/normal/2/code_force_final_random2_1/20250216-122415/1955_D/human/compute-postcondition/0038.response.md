Postcondition: `aa` must have at least `n` elements, `m` must be less than `n`, and `n - m` must be greater than 0. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is -1, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is -2. Otherwise, `pairs_in_D` is reduced by 1, `C[out_aa]` is -2, `D[out_aa]` is -1, and `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.
