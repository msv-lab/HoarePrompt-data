Output State: **`E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.**

This means that `E[out_aa]` has been decreased by 1, while the condition for `fnd` (whether it is increased by 1 or remains unchanged based on the comparison between `pairs_in_D` and `k`) remains the same as the initial state.
