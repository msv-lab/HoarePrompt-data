Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string with a length of at least 4, `count` is 3, `flag` is True, `j` is 3. If the substring `s[j:j+2]` equals "01", then `j` is updated to 3. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only considers the if part's effect on the variables.
