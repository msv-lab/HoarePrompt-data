Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 1, and the current value of `s[j]` is '1' and the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1'. This is because if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'` is true, `flag` is set to True and `j` is incremented to 1. Since there is no else part, these changes apply regardless of the condition.
