Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string with a length of at least 2, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 1, the current value of `s[j]` is '1', and the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1'**.

The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` was 0, so after executing this line, `j` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
