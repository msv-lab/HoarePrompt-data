Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of transitions from '0' to '1' in the string `s`. If at least one such transition is found, it subtracts one from the count. The function prints the final count for each test case and does not return any value.**
