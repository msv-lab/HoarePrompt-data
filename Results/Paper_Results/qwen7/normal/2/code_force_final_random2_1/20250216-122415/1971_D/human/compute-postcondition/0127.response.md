Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 500, and `s` is a binary string with a length between 1 and 500. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle a test case with two specific parameters: `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 500, and `s`, which is a binary string with a length between 1 and 500. The function does not accept these parameters directly but uses them internally to produce an output.
