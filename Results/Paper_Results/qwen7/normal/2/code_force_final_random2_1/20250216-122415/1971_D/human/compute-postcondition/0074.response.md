Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `count` is either 4 or remains 3, `flag` is True, `j` is either 4 or remains 3 and it must be less than `len(s) - 1`, and `len(s)` must be greater than 3. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is incremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 1.
