Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string with a length of at least 5, `count` is 4, `flag` is True, `j` is 5. If the character at position `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at position `j + 1`, then the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, and `j` remain unchanged.
