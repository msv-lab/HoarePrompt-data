Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the original string representation of an integer, the second element is the second integer input as a string, and the third element is the third integer input as a string.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which is 2 iterations based on the given information), `t` remains within the range of 1 to \(10^4\), `n` is the integer input by the user, and `a` is a list that contains three strings representing integers, with each string being the input provided during each iteration of the loop.
