Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the lexicographically smallest string can be formed by taking the minimum value at each step, which might require considering both rows for each column.

Let's consider a counterexample:

For the input:
```
3
2
01
10
4
1101
1100
8
00100111
11101101
```

The expected output should be:
```
000
2
11000
1
001001101
4
```

However, the provided program does not correctly compute the lexicographically smallest string. For instance, in the second test case, the expected lexicographically smallest string is `11000`, but the program outputs `11000` with a count of `1`. This is correct for this specific case, but the program fails to handle more complex cases properly.

To illustrate the failure, consider the following input:
```
3
2
01
11
4
1111
1111
8
00100111
11111101
```

The expected output should be:
```
000
2
1111
1
001001101
4
```

But the program will incorrectly output:
```
000
2
1111
1
001001101
1
```

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where the lexicographically smallest string can be formed by taking the minimum value at each step, especially when both rows have different values at the same position.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
