Output State: **`combined` is now a list without its last element; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `removed_item` is the smallest element pushed into the heap; `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from its previous value.**

The code `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` decreases `current_profit` by the first element of `removed_item`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
