Output State: **`combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, `bonuses` is a list containing the results of `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `k` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.**

The code sorts the `combined` list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order. The sorting does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged.
