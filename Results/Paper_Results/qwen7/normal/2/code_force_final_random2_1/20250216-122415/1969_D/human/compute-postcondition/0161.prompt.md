Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `k` is 0, `heap` contains elements popped from `combined` during the loop's iterations if `combined` was not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`. The values of `test_cases`, `t`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `current_profit + item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, `combined` is now one item smaller, `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, and `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` is set to `current_profit` if `current_profit > max_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is reassigned to `current_profit`, `combined` does not contain the last popped item (`item`), `removed_item` is the last element popped from `combined`, `current_profit` is adjusted by either subtracting `removed_item[0]` or by subtracting `item[1]` or increasing it by `item[0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is reassigned to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `combined` must contain at least one item less than before, `removed_item` is now equal to the last element popped from `combined`, `removed_item` is equal to the item that was pushed into the heap and then popped, if `removed_item[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
