Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(k)`. The key variables here are `k` and the loop counter (which is an underscore `_` but we don't need its exact value).

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that if `combined` had one less element after the execution of the if-else block, then `heap` has one more element which is the popped element from `combined`. If `combined` does not have one less element, then no changes are made to `heap`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop counter `_` is an underscore, it doesn't affect the state directly.
   - The variable `k` is the only variable in the loop head that can change the condition for the loop to continue.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 0.

Given the postcondition, the state at the end of the previous iteration should reflect that `k` is a positive integer and that the loop can still execute one more time.

**Step-by-step Reasoning**:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was a positive integer.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be a positive integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`k` is a positive integer**.
