Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `current_profit + item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, `combined` does not contain the last popped item (`item`), `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` is set to `current_profit` if `current_profit > max_profit`, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `current_profit` by adding the value of `item[0]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
