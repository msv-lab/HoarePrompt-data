Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the if-else block executes, `combined` will be an empty list, `max_profit` will be equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains 0, `test_cases` will remain unchanged, `t` will remain unchanged, `heap` will contain all elements that were popped from `combined` during the iterations, `remaining_items` will be an empty list, and `current_profit` will be 0 if `combined` is empty, otherwise `current_profit` will be the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `combined` now contains all but the last element of its original contents, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit` before the pop operation, otherwise `max_profit` remains 0, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` contains the item that was pushed and popped (`item`), `remaining_items` remains an empty list, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`, and the removed item (`removed_item`) is considered to be true.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `combined` is now one item shorter, `item` is the last element of `combined` before it was popped, `heap` contains the new item, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of the last item of the original `combined` if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`, and `current_profit` is further adjusted by the first element of `removed_item`; `max_profit` is set to the value of `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `combined` is now a list with one less item than before; `removed_item` is the item pushed into the heap; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the first element of `removed_item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is set to the value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
