Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, t is the length of test_cases, heap is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, prices and bonuses remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list called `remaining_items`. This list was not previously defined in the initial state, so it is now introduced and set to an empty list. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
