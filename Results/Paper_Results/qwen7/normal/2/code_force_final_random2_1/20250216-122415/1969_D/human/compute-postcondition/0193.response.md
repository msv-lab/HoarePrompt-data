Output State: **`combined` is now a list without its last element, `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list.**

Explanation: The code `item = combined.pop()` removes the last element from the `combined` list and assigns it to the variable `item`. Therefore, `combined` is now a list without its last element, and `item` holds the value of the last element that was removed from `combined`.
