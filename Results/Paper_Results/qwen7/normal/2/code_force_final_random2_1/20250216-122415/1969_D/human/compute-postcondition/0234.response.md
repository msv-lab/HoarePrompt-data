Output State: `combined` is an empty list; `heap` contains all the elements that were popped from `combined` during the iterations; `max_profit` is the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during the loop; `k` is the number of iterations the loop executed; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `combined` will be empty because the loop continues as long as `combined` is not empty. The `heap` will contain all the elements that were popped from `combined` during the iterations. `max_profit` will hold the highest profit value achieved during any iteration of the loop. The variable `k` will represent the total number of times the loop executed. Since no items are left in `combined`, `remaining_items` will also be an empty list. Lastly, `neg_prices` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.
