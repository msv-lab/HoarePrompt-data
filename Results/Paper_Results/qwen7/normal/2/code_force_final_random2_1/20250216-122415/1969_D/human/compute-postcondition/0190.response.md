Output State: **`combined` is an empty list, `heap` contains all the tuples that were popped from `combined` during the iterations, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, which is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, `k` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`**.

This means that the value of `max_profit` has been updated to be equal to `current_profit`, which was the result of the function call `func_3(combined, heap)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
