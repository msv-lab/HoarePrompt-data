Output State: **`combined` is now a list with one less item than before; `removed_item` is the item pushed into the heap; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the first element of `removed_item`; `max_profit` is set to the value of `current_profit`.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` simply assigns the current value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. No other changes are made to the variables, so the conditions and values of `combined`, `removed_item`, and `current_profit` remain as described in the initial state.
