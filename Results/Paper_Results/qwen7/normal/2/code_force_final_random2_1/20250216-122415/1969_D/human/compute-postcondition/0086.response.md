Output State: **`combined` is an empty list, `max_profit` holds the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during the loop's execution, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `current_profit` is 0, `prices` is the return value of `func_2()` (stored as a list), `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The line `prices = list(func_2())` calls the function `func_2()` and stores its return value in the variable `prices`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
