Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(k):`. The only variable here is `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `k`**: From the given information, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`. Therefore, `k` must be a non-negative integer for the loop to execute.

3. **Check if the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0 because `range(k)` will generate a sequence of integers starting from 0 up to `k-1`. If `k` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables mentioned (like `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `combined`, `test_cases`, `t`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` must be greater than 0**
