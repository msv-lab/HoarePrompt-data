Postcondition: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains elements popped from `combined` during the loop's iterations if `combined` was not empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, `combined` is now one item smaller, `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, and `item[0] + item[1] < 0`**
