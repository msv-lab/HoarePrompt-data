Output State: **`combined` now contains all but the last element of its original contents, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit` before the pop operation, otherwise `max_profit` remains 0, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` contains the item that was pushed and popped (`item`), `remaining_items` remains an empty list, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`, and the removed item (`removed_item`) is considered to be true.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` decreases `current_profit` by the value of `removed_item[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state as described.
