Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains two elements: the first element is the value of `n` and the second element is the value of `k` for each test case; `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `prices` and `bonuses` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    heap = []
    remaining_items = []
    n, k = func_2()
    prices = list(func_2())
    neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
    bonuses = list(func_2())
    max_profit = 0
    current_profit = 0
    combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
    combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
    for _ in range(k):
        if combined:
            heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
    if combined:
        current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit
    while combined:
        item = combined.pop()
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            current_profit -= item[1]
        else:
            current_profit += item[0]
        removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
        if removed_item:
            current_profit -= removed_item[0]
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
    print(max_profit)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `combined` is an empty list, `max_profit` holds the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during the loop's execution, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` is empty as all items have been processed, `remaining_items` remains an empty list, and `current_profit` is 0 since `combined` is now empty.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have completed, `combined` will be empty because the loop continues as long as `combined` is not empty. The value of `max_profit` will be the highest `current_profit` achieved during any iteration, ensuring it reflects the best possible outcome. The `heap` will be empty as all items have been pushed and popped. The `remaining_items` list remains unchanged and is empty. `Current_profit` is reset to 0 when `combined` becomes empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All items have been processed from the `combined` list, `heap` is empty, `max_profit` is the highest profit achieved during any iteration of the loop, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items, `k` remains 0, and the values of `test_cases`, `t`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The `combined` list is now empty, as it continues to be popped from until exhausted. The `heap` contains all the items that were popped from `combined` during the iterations, with each item potentially replaced by a more optimal choice as determined by the loop. The `current_profit` is the maximum profit achieved throughout the iterations, which is stored in `max_profit`. The `k` variable remains 0, indicating no additional operations were performed outside the loop. The `remaining_items` list remains empty, as it was not modified within the loop. The `neg_prices` list contains all the negative values from the `prices` list, which were identified and potentially used in adjusting the `current_profit`.

In summary, after all iterations, `combined` is empty, `heap` holds the optimal choices made during the process, `max_profit` reflects the highest profit achieved, `k` is unchanged at 0, `remaining_items` is still empty, and `neg_prices` retains the list of negative prices.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
