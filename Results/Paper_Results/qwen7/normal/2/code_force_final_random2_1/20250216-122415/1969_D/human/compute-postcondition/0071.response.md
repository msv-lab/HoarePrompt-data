Postcondition: `combined` is now a list with one less item than before. If the sum of the first and second elements of the last item that was removed from `combined` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of the last item. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of the last item.
