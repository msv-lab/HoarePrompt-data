The loop condition is `while combined:`. This means the loop will continue as long as the list `combined` is not empty.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition under which the loop continues:

1. The list `combined` must not be empty for the loop to continue.
2. The loop body processes the last element of `combined`, removes it, and updates some variables accordingly.

Given the postconditions provided, we know:
- `combined` is now a list without its last element.
- `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list.
- `removed_item` is the smallest element pushed into the heap.
- `current_profit` is equal to `max_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit` before the if statement; otherwise, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.

For the loop to continue, `combined` must still contain elements. Since the loop removes the last element from `combined`, `combined` will be non-empty if it had at least two elements initially.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `combined` is not empty. Given that `combined` is a list without its last element, it must have had at least two elements initially.

State: **`combined` must have at least two elements initially**
