Output State: **`k` is a positive integer - 1; `heap` contains the popped element from `combined` and the new element added by heappush.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pops an element from the `combined` list and pushes it into the `heap`. Since `k` was a positive integer - 1 before the operation, its value remains unchanged. The `heap` now contains the original popped element plus the newly added element from `combined`.
