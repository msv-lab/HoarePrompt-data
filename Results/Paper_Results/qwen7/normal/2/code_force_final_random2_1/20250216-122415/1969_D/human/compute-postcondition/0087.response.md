Output State: **`combined` is an empty list, `max_profit` holds the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during the loop's execution, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `current_profit` is 0, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code creates a new list `neg_prices` which contains the negative values of each element in the original `prices` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
