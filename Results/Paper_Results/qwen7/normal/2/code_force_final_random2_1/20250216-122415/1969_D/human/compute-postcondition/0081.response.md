Based on the initial state provided, the `max_profit` variable holds the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during the loop's execution. Since the loop continues as long as `combined` is not empty, and after all iterations, `combined` becomes empty, it implies that the loop has finished executing. During the loop's execution, `current_profit` was updated to reflect the best possible outcome, and this value is stored in `max_profit`.

Given that no specific values were provided for `current_profit` during the loop's execution, we can only conclude that `max_profit` contains the highest profit achieved during the iterations.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the highest value of current_profit encountered during the loop's execution)**
