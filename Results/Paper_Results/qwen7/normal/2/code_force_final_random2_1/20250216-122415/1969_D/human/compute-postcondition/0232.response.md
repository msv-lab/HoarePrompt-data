Postcondition: `heap` has had its last element replaced with `item`; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the condition: if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`; `current_profit` is now `current_profit - removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if the condition `current_profit > max_profit` is true.
