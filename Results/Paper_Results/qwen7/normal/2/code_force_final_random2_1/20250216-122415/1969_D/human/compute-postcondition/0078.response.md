Postcondition: `combined` is now a list with one less item than before; `removed_item` is the item pushed into the heap; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the first element of `removed_item`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is set to the value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.
