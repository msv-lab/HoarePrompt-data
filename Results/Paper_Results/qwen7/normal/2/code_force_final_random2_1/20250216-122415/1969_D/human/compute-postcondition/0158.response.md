Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `combined` must contain at least one item less than before, `removed_item` is now equal to the last element popped from `combined`, `removed_item` is equal to the item that was pushed into the heap and then popped, if `removed_item[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`**.

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` simply assigns the value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `k`, `heap`, `combined`, `removed_item`, and the condition related to `removed_item[0]` remain unchanged from their previous states.
