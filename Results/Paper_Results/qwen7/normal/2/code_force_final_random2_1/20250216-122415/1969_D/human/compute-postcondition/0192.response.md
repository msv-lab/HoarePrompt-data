The only variable in the loop head is the variable `combined`. For the loop to execute the first time, `combined` must contain at least one element.

Given the current state:
- `combined` is an empty list.
- `heap` contains all the tuples that were popped from `combined` during the iterations.
- `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, which is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`.
- `k` is 0.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.

To make the loop execute the first time, `combined` must not be an empty list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `combined` has at least one element.

State: **`combined` is not an empty list**
