Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, `bonuses` is a list containing the results of `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `k` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order (excluding the last tuple which was popped), `heap` is a list containing the tuple that was popped from `combined`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, and `combined` is not empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order (excluding the last tuple which was popped), `heap` is a list containing the tuple that was popped from `combined`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `k` is greater than 1, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, and either the last tuple from `combined` has been pushed into `heap` or the condition `combined` is false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order (excluding the last tuple which was popped), `heap` is a list containing one more tuple than before (the tuple that was popped from `combined`), `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, and the condition `combined` is false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
