Postcondition: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is reassigned to `current_profit`, `combined` must contain at least one item less than before, `removed_item` is now equal to the last element popped from `combined`, if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, then `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`.**
