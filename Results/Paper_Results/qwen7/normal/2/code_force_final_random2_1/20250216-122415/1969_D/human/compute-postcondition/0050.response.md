Output State: **`combined` now contains all but the last element of its original contents, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` contains the item that was pushed and popped (`item`), `remaining_items` remains an empty list, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`, and the removed item (`removed_item`) is considered to be true.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` simply assigns the value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. This does not change the values of any other variables mentioned in the precondition. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the precondition.
