Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty string, `l` is the total number of 'A's in the original string `a`, and `h` is the total number of characters in `a` that are not 'A's. If the total number of 'A's is greater than the total number of non-'A's, then `l` is greater than `h`. Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`.
