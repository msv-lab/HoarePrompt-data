Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in a`. The variables involved here are `j` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `a`. The postcondition mentions that `a` must have at least one element.

3. **Determine the Changes Inside the Loop**:
   - `l` is increased by 1 if `j` equals 'A'.
   - `h` is increased by 1 if `j` does not equal 'A'.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` must have at least one element.
   - `l` is increased by 1 if `j` equals 'A'.
   - `h` is increased by 1 if `j` does not equal 'A'.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `a` must have at least one element, it will still have at least one element for the next iteration.
   - `l` and `h` will be adjusted based on the value of `j` in the next iteration.

Given that `a` must have at least one element and the loop will continue as long as `a` has elements, we need to ensure that `a` still has at least one element for the next iteration. The values of `l` and `h` will change based on the next value of `j`, but their specific values are not relevant to the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` must have at least one element**.
