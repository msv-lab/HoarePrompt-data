Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in a:`. This means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. The variables `j`, `l`, `h`, `i`, and `t` will be modified during the loop execution, but we need to ensure the loop can start.

3. **Analyze the given states**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `h` is 0.
   - `i` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `t` remains the same.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `l` and `h` are both 0, they don't directly affect the loop's ability to execute. However, if `a` is empty, the loop won't execute.
   - `i` and `t` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition.
   - The key is ensuring that `a` has at least one element.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must have at least one element**
