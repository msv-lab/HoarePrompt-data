### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each string, the program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' using two counters `l` (for 'A') and `h` (for 'B').
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, the program compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If 'A' appears more frequently, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all given examples correctly. It can handle strings with varying numbers of 'A' and 'B', including edge cases like all 'A's or all 'B's.
5. **Distinct Strings**: The problem statement mentions that all strings are distinct, but this does not affect the correctness of the program as long as the logic works for any string of length 5.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all provided test cases accurately, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
