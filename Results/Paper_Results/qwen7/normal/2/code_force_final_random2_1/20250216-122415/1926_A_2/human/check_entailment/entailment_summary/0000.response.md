Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently in each of the given strings.
- The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each string individually.
- For each string, the program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' by iterating through each character.
- It then compares the counts and prints the character that appears more frequently.
- The logic in the program is sound and should work correctly for any valid input as per the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program meets the requirements and behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
