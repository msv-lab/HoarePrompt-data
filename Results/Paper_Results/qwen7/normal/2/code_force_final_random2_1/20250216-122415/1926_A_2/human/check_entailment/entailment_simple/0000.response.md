Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading a string of length 5.
3. For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
4. It then compares the counts and prints the character ('A' or 'B') that appears more frequently.
5. The logic to determine which character appears more frequently is correct: if the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
6. The program handles all test cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that all strings are distinct and of length 5.

Given the above points, the program logic and implementation match the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
