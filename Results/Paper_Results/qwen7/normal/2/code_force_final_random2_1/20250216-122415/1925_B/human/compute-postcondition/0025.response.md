Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // (i_current + 1)`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`, where `i` is `i_current + 1`. The conditions and relationships between `x`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, but `ans` now holds the updated maximum value.
