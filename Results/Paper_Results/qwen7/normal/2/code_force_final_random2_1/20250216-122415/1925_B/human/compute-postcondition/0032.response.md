Output State: **After all iterations, `x` is an integer, `i` is equal to `isqrt(x) + 1`, `ans` is the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` for all divisors `i` of `x` such that `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `ans` will hold the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` for every divisor `i` of `x` where `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`. The variable `i` will be set to `isqrt(x) + 1` since the loop increments `i` from 1 up to the square root of `x`.
