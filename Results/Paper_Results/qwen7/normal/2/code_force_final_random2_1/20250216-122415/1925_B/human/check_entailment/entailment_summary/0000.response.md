Reasoning:

The program aims to find the maximum balance of a problemset, which is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems. The logic implemented in `func_1` is as follows:

1. It reads the values of \( x \) and \( n \) for each test case.
2. It iterates through all numbers from 1 to the square root of \( x \).
3. For each number \( i \) that divides \( x \), it checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to either \( x // i \) or \( i \).
4. If the condition is met, it updates the answer (`ans`) with the maximum value between \( i \) and \( x // i \).

This approach is correct because:
- The GCD of a set of numbers is maximized when the numbers are as evenly distributed as possible.
- By iterating through the divisors of \( x \) and checking the conditions, the program effectively finds the largest possible GCD that can be achieved by splitting \( x \) into \( n \) parts.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program should correctly compute the maximum balance for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
