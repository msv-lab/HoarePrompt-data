Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i`, and `n` must be greater than `x // (i + 1)` if `i + 1` is a divisor of `x`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `x` remains an integer, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and either `i` or `x // i`. Additionally, `n` must still satisfy the condition of being greater than `x // (i + 1)` if `i + 1` is a divisor of `x`.
