Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, `n` is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`, `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `i`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. The values of `x`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
