Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not guarantee finding the maximum balance of the problemset. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding GCD**: The program attempts to find the maximum balance by iterating through potential divisors of `x` and checking if they can be used to split the problem into `n` parts. However, it does not ensure that the GCD of these parts is maximized.

2. **Incomplete Implementation**: The function `func_1` does not actually implement the logic to maximize the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties. It only checks if the divisor `i` can be used to split `x` into `n` parts and updates `ans` accordingly.

3. **Missing Key Insight**: To maximize the balance (GCD), the optimal strategy is to use the largest possible common divisor of `x` and `n`. This can be achieved by setting each sub-problem's difficulty to `x // n`.

### Corrected Program:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = x // n
    print(ans)
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum balance by setting each sub-problem's difficulty to `x // n`, which ensures the GCD of the difficulties is maximized.
