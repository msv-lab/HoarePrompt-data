Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum balance for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the case where `n` is greater than `sqrt(x)` but less than `x // i`. This can lead to missing optimal solutions where the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties could be higher.

For example, consider the test case:
- Input: `x = 12`, `n = 4`
- Expected output: `3` (since the optimal solution is to split the problem into difficulties `[3, 3, 3, 3]` which gives a GCD of `3`).

However, the current implementation only checks up to `sqrt(x)` and does not consider the case where `n` is greater than `sqrt(x)` but less than `x // i`. Therefore, it might miss the optimal solution.
