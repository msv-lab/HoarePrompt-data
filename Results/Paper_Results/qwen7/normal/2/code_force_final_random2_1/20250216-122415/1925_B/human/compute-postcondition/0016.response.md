Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `i`, and `n` must be greater than `x // (i + 1)` if `i + 1` is a divisor of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the new value of `i`. The other variables (`x`, `i`, `ans`, and `n`) are updated as described, but no new conditions are introduced. The condition for `n` remains the same, depending on whether `i + 1` is a divisor of `x`.
