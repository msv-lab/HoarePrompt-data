Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `isqrt(x) + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `ans` is updated to be the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and either `i` or `x // i`.
   - `n` must be greater than `x // (i + 1)` if `i + 1` is a divisor of `x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - The value of `n` must be greater than `x // (i + 1)` if `i + 1` is a divisor of `x`.

Given that the loop runs until `i` reaches `isqrt(x) + 1`, let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current` and the current value of `n` as `n_current`.

- **New value of `i`**: `i_current + 1`.
- **Condition for `n`**: `n` must be greater than `x // (i_current + 2)` if `i_current + 1` is a divisor of `x`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `i_current` and `n_current`, we'll express the state in terms of these values.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `x` remains the same.
- `i` becomes `i_current + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than `x // (i_current + 2)` if `i_current + 1` is a divisor of `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` must be greater than `x // (i_current + 2)` if `i_current + 1` is a divisor of `x`**.
