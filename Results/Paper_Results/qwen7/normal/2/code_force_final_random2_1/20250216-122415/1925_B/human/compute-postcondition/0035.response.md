Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of positive integers \( x \) and \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^8 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq x \)). For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum value between \( i \) and \( x // i \) for all divisors \( i \) of \( x \) such that \( n \) is less than or equal to either \( x // i \) or \( i \).**
