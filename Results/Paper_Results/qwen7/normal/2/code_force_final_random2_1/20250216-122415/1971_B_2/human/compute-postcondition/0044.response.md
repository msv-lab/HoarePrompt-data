Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 999\); `s` is a positive integer within this range, and if the length of `s` is 1, `s` remains unchanged; otherwise, `s` is rotated by one character to the left; `s2` is a random permutation of the characters in `s`, and after the if-else block, `s2` either remains unchanged (if `s == s2`) or is not equal to `s2` (if `s != s2`).
