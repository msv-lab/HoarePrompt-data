Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `s` is an input string.
- `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, and the length of the set `a` is 1.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
