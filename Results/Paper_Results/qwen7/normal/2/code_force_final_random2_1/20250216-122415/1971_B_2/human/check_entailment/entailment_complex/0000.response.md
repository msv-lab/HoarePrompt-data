Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format, where the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent line contains a string `s`.
2. The program checks if the string `s` consists of only one unique character. If so, it prints "NO" because no rearrangement of `s` would result in a different string.
3. If `s` has more than one unique character, the program prints "YES" and then either the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` or the lexicographically largest permutation of `s`, depending on whether `s` is already sorted in ascending order.
4. The logic for determining the smallest and largest permutations is sound. Sorting the string in ascending order gives the smallest permutation, and sorting it in descending order gives the largest permutation.
5. The program handles all given examples correctly, as shown in the annotated program.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
