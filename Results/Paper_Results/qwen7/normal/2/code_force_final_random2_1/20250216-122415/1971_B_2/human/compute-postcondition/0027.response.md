Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, `b` is a string that is the sorted version of `s`, `c` is a string that is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since neither part modifies these variables. Therefore, regardless of whether the condition `b == s` is true or false, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
