Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of the set `a` is 1, no changes occur. Otherwise, `a` remains a set containing unique characters from `s`, and `b` is a sorted string of `s`, while `c` is a string consisting of the characters of `s` sorted in descending order.
