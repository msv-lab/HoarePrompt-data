Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 999\); `s` is a positive integer within this range, and if the length of `s` is 1, `s` remains unchanged; otherwise, `s` is either rotated by one character to the left or permuted randomly, but `s2` (the result of the operation) equals `s` if and only if `s` is rotated by one character to the left.**
