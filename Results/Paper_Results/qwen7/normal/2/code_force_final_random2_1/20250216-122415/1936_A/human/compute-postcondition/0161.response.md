Output State: **`i` is `mak + 1`, `len(pans)` must be greater than `mak + 1`**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream. Therefore, the values of `i` and the condition on `len(pans)` remain unchanged.
