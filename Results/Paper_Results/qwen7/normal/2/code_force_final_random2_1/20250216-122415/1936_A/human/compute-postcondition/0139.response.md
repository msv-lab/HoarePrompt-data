Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 2, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input, and `s` is the new input string. If `s` equals `<`, `pans` is now a list containing the integer `i`; otherwise, `pans` is a list containing the element `i` and `s` remains unchanged or becomes the new input string.
