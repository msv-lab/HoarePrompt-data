Functionality: **The function interacts with a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) by making up to \(3n\) queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation. After determining the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\), the function prints "! i j".**
