Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mak` is 0, `i` is `len(pans)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`, `iterations` must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '<':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is the length of `pans`, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0, and if the current input is less than 0, the function does not change any additional variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the length of `pans` + 1, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0, and if the input string is `<`, no changes are made to `pans`, `mak`, or `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the length of `pans` + 2, `mak` is equal to `i`, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. If the input string is '<', no changes are made to `i`, `mak`, or `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
