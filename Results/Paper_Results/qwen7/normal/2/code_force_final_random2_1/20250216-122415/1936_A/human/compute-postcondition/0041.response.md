Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means it ensures that any pending output is written to the console immediately. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables `i` and `n`. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.
