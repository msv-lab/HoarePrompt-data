Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`
   - `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 1
   - `mak` is equal to `i`
   - `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input
   - `s` is the new input string
   - If `s` equals '<', then `pans` contains the value of `i`.
   - Otherwise, `pans` contains `[length of `pans` + number of iterations]` and the current value of `s` is equal to '='.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop condition is based on `i` being less than `n`, we need to update `i` for the next iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was set to the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

5. **New State Calculation:**
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `mak2` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `mak` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `pans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be updated to the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 2.
   - All other variables remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 2, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input, and `s` is the new input string.**
