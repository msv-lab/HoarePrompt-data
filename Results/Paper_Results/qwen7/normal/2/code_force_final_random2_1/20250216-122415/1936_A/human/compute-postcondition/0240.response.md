Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `-1`, `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`**.

Explanation: The code sets `mak` to 0. Since `mak`, `mak2`, `num_iterations`, `i`, and `pans` were already defined in the initial state and none of these variables are modified by the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged except for `mak` which is explicitly set to 0. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `mak` while keeping the rest of the variables as they were initially.
