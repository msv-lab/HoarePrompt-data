### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to ensure it correctly finds the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\) using at most \(3n\) queries.

1. **Initialization and Query Setup:**
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases and the size of the permutation \(n\).
   - It initializes `mak` to 0, which is used to track the index with the highest bitwise OR value encountered so far.

2. **First Pass to Find the Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - For each index \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), it compares \(p_{mak} \mid p_i\) with \(p_{mak} \mid p_i\).
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to \(i\). This step ensures that `mak` holds the index of the element with the highest bitwise OR value when paired with itself.

3. **Second Pass to Collect Possible Candidates:**
   - It initializes `mak2` to `mak`.
   - It iterates through all indices \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\) and compares \(p_{mak2} \mid p_i\) with \(p_{mak2} \mid p_{mak2}\).
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak2` to \(i\) and stores \(i\) in `pans`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends \(i\) to `pans`.

4. **Third Pass to Determine the Best Pair:**
   - It iterates through the candidates stored in `pans` and compares \(p_{mak2} \mid p_{pans[i]}\) with \(p_{pans[mak]} \mid p_{pans[mak]}\).
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mak` to \(i\).

5. **Final Output:**
   - It prints the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` which are expected to maximize the bitwise XOR value.

### Analysis:
- **Query Efficiency:** The code makes a total of \(3n\) queries as required.
- **Index Selection:** The logic for selecting the indices seems sound, but we need to verify if it always finds the correct pair.
- **Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases like when `mak` and `mak2` are the same by collecting all indices that give a bitwise OR equal to `p_{mak2} \mid p_{mak2}`.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided logic and the constraints, the code appears to correctly implement the solution. It efficiently uses the allowed number of queries and should find the indices that maximize the bitwise XOR value.

### Correctness:
**True**
