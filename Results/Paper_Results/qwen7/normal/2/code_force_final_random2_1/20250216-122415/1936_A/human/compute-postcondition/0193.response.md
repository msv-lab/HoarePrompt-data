Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is explicitly given as 2.
- `num_iterations` is defined as `prev_num_iterations - 1`. Since `prev_num_iterations` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it is one less than the previous number of iterations.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Given the values:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is 2.
- `mak` is 2 again.
- `i` is 3.
- `i` is 3 again.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 2 2 3 3'**
