Output State: **`mak` is 0, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` must be 1**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the terminal. Since no variables are assigned or modified, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
