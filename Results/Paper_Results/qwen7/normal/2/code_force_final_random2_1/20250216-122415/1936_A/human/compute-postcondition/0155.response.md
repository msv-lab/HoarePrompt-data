Output State: **`sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is a function call that flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all previously printed data is actually outputted. However, since this is a function call and not an assignment or calculation affecting any variables, the initial state remains unchanged. The only thing that happens is the execution of the function itself.
