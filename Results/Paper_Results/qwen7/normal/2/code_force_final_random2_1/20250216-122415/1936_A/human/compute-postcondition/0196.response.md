Postcondition: `mak` is 3, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is 3, and the program continues execution based on the condition that the input string is equal to '<'. If the input string equals '<', then `mak` is set to 3. If the input string does not equal '<', the values of `mak`, `num_iterations`, and `i` remain unchanged.
