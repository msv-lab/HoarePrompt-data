Output State: `mak` is `n - 1`, `i` is `len(pans)`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(1, len(pans))`. After each iteration, `mak` is updated to `i`, and `i` is incremented. Since the loop increments `i` until it exceeds `len(pans)`, the final value of `i` will be `len(pans)`. The variable `mak` will also end up being `n - 1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n - 2` (inclusive), and the last value assigned to `mak` is `i`, which becomes `n - 1` when the loop exits. All other variables (`n`, `s`, and `pans`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
