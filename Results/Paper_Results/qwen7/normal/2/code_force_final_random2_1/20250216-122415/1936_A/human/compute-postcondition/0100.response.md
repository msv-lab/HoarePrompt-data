Output State: **`i` is the length of `pans` + 1, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` simply assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Since `i` is defined as the length of `pans` + 1, `mak` now also holds the same value. All other variables remain unchanged.
