Output State: **`mak` is 3, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i`, which is 3, to the variable `mak`. The other variables (`mak2`, `num_iterations`, `i`, and `pans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
