Based on the initial state provided, the variables and objects involved in the print statement are:

- `pans` is a list.
- `mak` is an index into the list `pans`.
- `i` is another index into the list `pans`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

This statement will print the following:
- A question mark (`?`).
- The value at index `mak` in the list `pans`.
- The value at index `mak` in the list `pans` again (repeated).
- The value at index `i` in the list `pans`.
- The value at index `i` in the list `pans` again (repeated).

Since the exact values of `pans`, `mak`, and `i` are not specified, we cannot provide a more precise output. Therefore, the output will be a string with the placeholders for these values.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]**
