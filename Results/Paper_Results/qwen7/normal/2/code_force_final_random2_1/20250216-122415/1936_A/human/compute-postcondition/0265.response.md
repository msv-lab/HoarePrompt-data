Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It interacts with a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) which is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\). The function can make up to \(3n\) queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation. After determining the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\), the function prints "! i j".**

This means the function needs to find the pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) in the permutation where the bitwise XOR of the elements at those indices is maximized, and then report these indices.
