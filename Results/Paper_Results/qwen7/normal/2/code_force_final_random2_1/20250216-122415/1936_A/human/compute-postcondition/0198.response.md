Output State: **The final value of `mak` will be `n-1`, `num_iterations` will be `prev_num_iterations - 1`, and `i` will be `n-1`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `mak` will hold the value `n-1`, `num_iterations` will be `prev_num_iterations - 1`, and `i` will also be `n-1`. This is because the loop increments `mak` by 1 in each iteration up to `n-1`, and `i` takes on the value of `n-1` just before the loop terminates. The condition for the loop to continue is that the input string must be '<', which allows `mak` to be updated to the current value of `i` during each iteration.
