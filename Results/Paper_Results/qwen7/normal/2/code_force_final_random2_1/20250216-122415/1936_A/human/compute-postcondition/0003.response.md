State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1** 

### Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
- The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i < n`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 because `i` starts from 1 and the loop continues until `i < n`.

Therefore, the initial state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is set to 1 and `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can execute.
