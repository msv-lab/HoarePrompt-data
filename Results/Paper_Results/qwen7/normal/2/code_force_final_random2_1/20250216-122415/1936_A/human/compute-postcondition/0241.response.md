Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `range(1, len(pans))`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to `-1` outside the loop.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from `1` up to but not including `len(pans)`. Therefore, `i` must start at `1` for the loop to begin executing.

4. **Check the Length of `pans`**: The length of `pans` is `len(pans)`. For the loop to execute, `len(pans)` must be at least `2` (since the loop starts at `1` and goes up to but not including `len(pans)`).

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to adjust the initial value of `i` to `1` and ensure that `len(pans)` is at least `2`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `1`.
- `len(pans)` must be at least `2`.

Here is the final state:

**State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `1`, `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`, `len(pans)` must be at least `2`**
