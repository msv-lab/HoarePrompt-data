Output State: **`i` is the length of `pans` + 2, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` simply reassigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Since `i` is defined as the length of `pans` + 2, `mak` now also holds this same value. The other variables (`n`) remain unchanged.
