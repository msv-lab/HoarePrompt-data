Output State: **`mak` is 1, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `mak` is now 1, while `mak2` remains `n-1`, `num_iterations` remains `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is incremented to 2, and `pans` stays as `[n-2, n-1]`.
