Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is the length of `pans` + 1.
   - `mak` is equal to `i`.
   - `n` is an input integer and it is greater than 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

From the initial state:
- `i` is the length of `pans` + 1.
- Since `mak` is equal to `i`, `mak` is also the length of `pans` + 1.
- `i` and `mak` have the same value, which is the length of `pans` + 1.

Given that `n` is an input integer and it is greater than 0, this value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- A question mark (`?`)
- The value of `mak` (which is the length of `pans` + 1)
- The value of `mak` again (same as above)
- The value of `i` (which is the length of `pans` + 1)
- The value of `i` again (same as above)

Output: **'? [length of pans + 1] [length of pans + 1] [length of pans + 1] [length of pans + 1]**
