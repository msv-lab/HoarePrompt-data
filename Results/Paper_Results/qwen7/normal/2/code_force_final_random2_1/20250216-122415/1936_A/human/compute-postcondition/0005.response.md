Output State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `mak`, `i`, and `n`. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the standard output device (like the console). Since no variables are modified or checked, their values remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
