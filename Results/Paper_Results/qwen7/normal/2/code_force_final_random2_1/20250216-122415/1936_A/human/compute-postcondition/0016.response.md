Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `mak` is 2
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - The input received is less than 0

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must increment to 3.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` will now be 3).

Given these points, we need to update the state of `i` to 3 and ensure that `n` is still greater than 2.

**Final State**:
State: **`mak` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, and the input received is less than 0**
