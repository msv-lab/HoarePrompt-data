Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `i` is the length of `pans` plus (number of iterations + 1) plus 2.
   - `mak` is equal to `i`.
   - `n` is the input integer greater than 0.
   - `s` is the new input string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

From the initial state:
- `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
- `i` is calculated as the length of `pans` plus (number of iterations + 1) plus 2.
- `mak` is set to the value of `i`.

Therefore, `mak` and `mak2` will have the same value, which is `i`.

The print statement will output:
- `'?'` (a literal string)
- `mak` (which is `i`)
- `mak2` (which is also `i`)

So, the output will be:
Output: **'? [i] [i]' (where i is the length of pans plus (number of iterations + 1) plus 2)**
