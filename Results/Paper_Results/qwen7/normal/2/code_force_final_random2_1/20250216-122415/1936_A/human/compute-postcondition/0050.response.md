Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `s` is an input string (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `pans` is a list containing the element 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head)

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to `2`.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `s` is an input string (unchanged)
   - `pans` is a list containing the element 1 (unchanged)

Therefore, the final state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an input string, and `pans` is a list containing the element 1**
