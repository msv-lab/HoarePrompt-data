Output State: **`mak2` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `n-1`, and `pans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `pans`. This does not affect the values of `mak2`, `mak`, `num_iterations`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values.
