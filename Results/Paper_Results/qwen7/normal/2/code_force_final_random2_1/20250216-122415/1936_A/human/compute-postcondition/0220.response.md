Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing `n-2`, `s` is an input string from user**.

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `mak` is now equal to `i`, while `mak2`, `num_iterations`, `i`, `pans`, and `s` retain their original values.
