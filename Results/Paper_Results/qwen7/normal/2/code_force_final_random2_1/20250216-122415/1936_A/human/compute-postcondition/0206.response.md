Output State: **`mak` is `n-2`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `n-2`, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is an input string, and the current value of `s` is `<`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is `n-2`) to `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
