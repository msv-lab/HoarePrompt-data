Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `mak` is 1.
   - `mak2` is `n-1`.
   - `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Evaluating the Print Statement**:
   - `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 1, `pans[mak]` refers to the second element of the list `pans`. Given that `pans` is `[n-2, n-1]`, `pans[mak]` is `n-1`.
   - `pans[mak]`: This is the same as above, so it is also `n-1`.
   - `pans[i]`: Since `i` is 3, `pans[i]` would refer to the element at index 3 of the list `pans`. However, `pans` only contains two elements, so this would result in an `IndexError` if the code were to run as-is. But since the question asks us to determine what would be printed based on the given information, we should consider the valid indices available in `pans`.

Given that `pans` only has two elements, the valid indices are 0 and 1. Therefore, `pans[i]` where `i` is 3 does not apply here, and we should assume the print statement is meant to use the valid indices.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output: `'?' followed by the second element of `pans` twice, and the first element of `pans` twice.
   - So, the output will be: `'?, n-1, n-1, n-2, n-2'`.

Output: **?, n-1, n-1, n-2, n-2**
