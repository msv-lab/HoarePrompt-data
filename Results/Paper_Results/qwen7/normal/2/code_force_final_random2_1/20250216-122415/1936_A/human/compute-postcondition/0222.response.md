Output State: **`mak2` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing `n-2` and `n-1`, `s` is an input string from user.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `i` (which is `n-1`) to the list `pans`. Initially, `pans` contains the value `n-2`. After appending `n-1` to `pans`, the list `pans` now contains both `n-2` and `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
