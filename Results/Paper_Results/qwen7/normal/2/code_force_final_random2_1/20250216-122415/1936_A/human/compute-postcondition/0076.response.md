Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(pans) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is `i`
   - `i` is `n`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `s` is the input string '>'
   - `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`

4. **Determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `len(pans) - 1`, if the current value of `i` is within this range, it will increment by 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `len(pans)`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `n` and `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to continue, `i` (which is `n`) must be less than `len(pans)`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `mak` remains unchanged as `i` because the postcondition states that `mak` remains unchanged if the input string is '>'.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same as `i` because `i` is `n`.
   - `s` remains the input string '>'.
   - `pans` remains the same list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`mak` is `i + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`**
