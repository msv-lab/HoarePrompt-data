Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `len(pans)`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted based on the loop conditions.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(pans) - 1` (since `range(1, len(pans))` starts at 1 and goes up to `len(pans) - 1`). Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(pans)` for the loop to continue executing.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `mak + 1`
   - `mak` is now equal to `i`
   - `len(pans)` must be greater than `mak + 1`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently `mak + 1`, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - After incrementing `i`, it becomes `mak + 2`.
   - `mak` is updated to `i`, so `mak` becomes `mak + 1`.
   - `len(pans)` must still be greater than `mak + 1`, which means `len(pans)` must be greater than `(mak + 1) + 1 = mak + 2`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` becomes `mak + 2`
   - `mak` becomes `mak + 1`
   - `len(pans)` must still be greater than `mak + 2`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `mak + 2`, `mak` is `mak + 1`, `len(pans)` must be greater than `mak + 2***.
