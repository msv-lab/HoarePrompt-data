Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `1`, `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`, `len(pans)` is at least `2`.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed data is actually outputted. Since no variables are assigned new values or modified, the initial state remains unchanged.
