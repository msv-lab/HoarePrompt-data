Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(n)`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: 
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 2.
   - `mak` is equal to `i`.
   - `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input.
   - `s` is the new input string.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `length of pans + (number of iterations + 1) + 2`.
   - Since `n` is the input integer, it remains unchanged.
   - `mak2` and `mak` will both be updated to the new value of `i`.
   - `s` will remain unchanged or become the new input string, but since we are only concerned with the loop head, we do not need to update `s` here.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `mak2` will be equal to `mak`.
   - `i` will be the length of `pans` + (number of iterations + 1) + 2.
   - `mak` will be equal to `i`.
   - `n` will remain the same.
   - `s` will remain unchanged or become the new input string, but we do not need to specify this explicitly for the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations + 1) + 2, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input, and `s` is the new input string.**
