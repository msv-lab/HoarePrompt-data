Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. The key variables here are the input value used to determine the number of iterations and the loop counter (which is `_` in this case, but we don't need to worry about it since it's an underscore).

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `mak` is equal to `len(pans) - 1`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed in each iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as the input value (let's call it `num_iterations`) is greater than 0. After each iteration, `mak` is updated to `len(pans) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The input value (`num_iterations`) determines how many times the loop will run.
   - Since `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed in each iteration, it doesn't affect the state variables directly but ensures that the output is flushed after each iteration.
   - `mak` is updated to `len(pans) - 1` at the end of each iteration.

Given that the loop continues based on the input value, and assuming the input value is decremented or remains the same after each iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value (`num_iterations`). 

Since the exact value of `num_iterations` is not given, we can represent it as a variable that decreases with each iteration until it reaches 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the input value (`num_iterations`) is decremented by 1 from its previous value.

**State:**
- `mak` is equal to `len(pans) - 1`
- `num_iterations` is decreased by 1 from its previous value

If we denote the previous value of `num_iterations` as `prev_num_iterations`, then the new value would be `prev_num_iterations - 1`.

So, the final state can be represented as:

State: **`mak` is equal to `len(pans) - 1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`**
