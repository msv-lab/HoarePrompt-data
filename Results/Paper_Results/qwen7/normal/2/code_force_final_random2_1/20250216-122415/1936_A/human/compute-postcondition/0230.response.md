Output State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `n-2`, `pans` is a list containing either `[i]` or `[n-2, n-1]` depending on whether `s` equals `'<'` or `'='`, respectively, and `s` is an input string from the user, and `s` is assigned the value of the input string.**

This output state reflects that the variable `s` has been updated to the input string provided by the user, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
