Output State: **`freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` contains the total count of numbers that meet the specified conditions across all iterations, `freq` holds the count of numbers that have specific `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs as their remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from `case['params']`, and `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` must contain at least one more element.**

The code initializes `freq` as an empty dictionary. This means that all other variables retain their previous values, including `beautiful_count`, `freq`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the structure of `results`. The only change is that `freq` is now an empty dictionary.
