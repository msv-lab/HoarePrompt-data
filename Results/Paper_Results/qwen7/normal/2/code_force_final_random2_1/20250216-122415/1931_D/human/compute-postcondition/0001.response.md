State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of triples (n, x, y, a) where n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, x and y are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `results` is an empty list, `case` is the first element in `test_cases`**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop iterates over each element in `test_cases`. Therefore, the variable `case` is the one being adjusted in each iteration.
2. **Initial state of `case`**: Since `case` is being assigned the first element from `test_cases` at the start of the loop, it must be set to the first element of `test_cases`.
3. **Other variables**: The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, and `results`) are not directly involved in the loop's condition or assignment within the loop body, so they remain as given in the initial state.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `case` is the first element in `test_cases`, while the other variables retain their initial values.
