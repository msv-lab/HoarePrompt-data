Output State: **`beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] + 1`, `mod_y` is now the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `a` must have at least one element, `mod_x` is now the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.**

Explanation: The code increases `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
