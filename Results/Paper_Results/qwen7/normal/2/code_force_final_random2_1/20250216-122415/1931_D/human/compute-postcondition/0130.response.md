Output State: **`beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` + 1, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `a` must have at least one element, `mod_x` is now the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is updated to its original value plus 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_x` as the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
