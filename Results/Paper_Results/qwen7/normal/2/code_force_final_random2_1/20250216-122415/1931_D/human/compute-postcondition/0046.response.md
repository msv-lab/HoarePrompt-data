Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` to 0. This does not affect the values of `beautiful_count`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, or `required_mod_y`. The value of `beautiful_count` remains incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, and the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` remain as they were before the code was executed.
