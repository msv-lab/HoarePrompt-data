Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` values. According to the problem description, a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). However, the program uses modulo operations to find these conditions, which is not appropriate.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input: \(t = 1\), \(n = 6\), \(x = 5\), \(y = 2\), \(a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]\)

The program will produce incorrect results because it does not correctly check the conditions \(a_i + a_j \mod x = 0\) and \(a_i - a_j \mod y = 0\).

To fix this, the program should directly check if the sums and differences of the elements satisfy the divisibility conditions without using modulo operations in the way they are currently used.
