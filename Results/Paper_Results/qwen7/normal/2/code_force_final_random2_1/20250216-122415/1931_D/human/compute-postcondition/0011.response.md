Output State: **`a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `num` is the first element of `a`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. No other changes are made to the variables `a`, `num`, or `required_mod_x`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions except for the new assignment to `required_mod_y`.
