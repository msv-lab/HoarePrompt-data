Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step and compare it with the problem statement.

1. **Input Processing**: The function `func_1` correctly processes each test case, extracting `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.

2. **Frequency Tracking**: A dictionary `freq` is used to track the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs. This is necessary to count the number of beautiful pairs efficiently.

3. **Beautiful Pair Calculation**:
   - For each element `num` in the array `a`, the program calculates `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
   - It then computes the required `mod_x` and `mod_y` values that would make the pair beautiful.
   - If the required `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.

4. **Output**: The function correctly appends the count of beautiful pairs to the `results` list and returns it at the end.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs. The approach of using modulo operations and frequency tracking ensures that all conditions for a beautiful pair are checked efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
