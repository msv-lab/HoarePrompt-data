Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each element of the array and calculating its modulus with respect to \(x\) and \(y\).
2. It then checks if there are any previously seen numbers that would form a "beautiful pair" with the current number based on the given conditions.
3. However, there are a few issues with the logic:
   - The calculation of `required_mod_x` should be based on the condition that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\), which means \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\). This is not correctly implemented.
   - The calculation of `required_mod_y` should be based on the condition that \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\), which means \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\). This is also not correctly implemented.
   - The program does not correctly implement the conditions for forming beautiful pairs.
4. Given the example inputs and outputs, the provided program does not seem to correctly calculate the number of beautiful pairs. For instance, in the first example, the program outputs 2, but the correct answer should be 2 based on the provided problem statement and examples.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs based on the given conditions.
