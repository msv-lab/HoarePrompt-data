Output State: **`a` is an empty array, `beautiful_count` contains the total count of numbers that meet the specified conditions across all iterations, `freq` holds the count of numbers that have specific `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs as their remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, and `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(beautiful_count)` appends the current value of `beautiful_count` to the list `results`. Since `beautiful_count` was calculated during the loop iterations, it now becomes the last element in the `results` list. The other variables (`a`, `freq`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
