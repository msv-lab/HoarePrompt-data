Postcondition: `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, then `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 0.
