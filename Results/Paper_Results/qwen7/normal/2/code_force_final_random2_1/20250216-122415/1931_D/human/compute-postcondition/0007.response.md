Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `num` which iterates over the elements of the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `num` will take each value from the list `a` one by one during the loop execution.

3. **Initial state before the loop**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `test_cases` is a list of triples \((n, x, y, a)\).
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `n` is the first element of `case['params']`.
   - `x` is the second element of `case['params']`.
   - `y` is the third element of `case['params']`.
   - `case` is now the second element in `test_cases`.
   - `a` is the array from the second element in `test_cases`.
   - `freq` is an empty dictionary.
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop iterates over the elements of `a`, the only relevant variable here is `num`, which will take the values from the list `a`.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the list `a` and the variable `num` which will take its values one by one during the loop iterations.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `num` is the first element of `a`**.
