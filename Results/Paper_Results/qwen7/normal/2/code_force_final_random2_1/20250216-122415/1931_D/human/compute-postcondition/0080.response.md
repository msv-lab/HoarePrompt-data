Output State: **`a` is a non-empty array with at least one element (excluding the first element), `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `mod_y = num % y` updates the value of `mod_y` to be the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. The other variables (`a`, `required_mod_y`, and `freq`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
