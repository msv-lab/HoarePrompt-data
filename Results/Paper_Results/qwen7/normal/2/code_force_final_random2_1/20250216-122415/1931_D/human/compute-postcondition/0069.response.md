Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty array with at least one element, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.
