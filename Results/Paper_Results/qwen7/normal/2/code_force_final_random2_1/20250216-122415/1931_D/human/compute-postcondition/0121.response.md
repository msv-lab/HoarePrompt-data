Postcondition: `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `a` must have at least one element, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is present in `freq`.
