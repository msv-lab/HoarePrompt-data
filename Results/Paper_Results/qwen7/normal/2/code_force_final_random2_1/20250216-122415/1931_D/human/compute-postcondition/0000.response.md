Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of triples (n, x, y, a), where n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, x and y are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i; `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the values of `t` or `test_cases`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while updating the new state of `results`.
