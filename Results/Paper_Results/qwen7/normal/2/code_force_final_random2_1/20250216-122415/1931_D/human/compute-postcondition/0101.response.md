Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty array with at least one less element (excluding the first element), `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is incremented by 1, and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is set to 0.
