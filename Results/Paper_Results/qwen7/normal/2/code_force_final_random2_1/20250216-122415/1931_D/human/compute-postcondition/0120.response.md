Output State: **`beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `a` must have at least one element, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is present in `freq`.**

Explanation: The line `beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` increments the value of `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
