You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries containing the parameters for each test case).
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Loop Through Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.
   - It prints the details of the current test case for debugging purposes.

3. **Frequency Dictionary Initialization**:
   - A dictionary `freq` is initialized to keep track of the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
   - A variable `beautiful_count` is initialized to zero to count the number of beautiful pairs.

4. **Iterate Over Array Elements**:
   - For each element `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y` using modulo operations with `x` and `y` respectively.
   - It computes the required `mod_x` and `mod_y` values that would make the pair beautiful.
   - If the required `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair exists in the `freq` dictionary, it adds the corresponding frequency to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency of the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair in the `freq` dictionary.

5. **Store Result**:
   - After processing all elements in the array for the current test case, it appends `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

### Verification Against Problem Description

- **Modulo Calculations**: The program correctly calculates the modulo values and checks if the required conditions for a beautiful pair are met.
- **Frequency Counting**: The program uses a frequency dictionary to efficiently count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
- **Output**: The program outputs the correct number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement to ensure the program works as expected.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `t = 1`, `n = 6`, `x = 5`, `y = 2`, `a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`
- Output: `2`

- Processing:
  - For `num = 1`: 
    - `mod_x = 1`, `mod_y = 1`
    - Required `mod_x = 4`, `mod_y = 1` (not found in `freq`)
  - For `num = 2`: 
    - `mod_x = 2`, `mod_y = 2`
    - Required `mod_x = 3`, `mod_y = 2` (not found in `freq`)
  - For `num = 7`: 
    - `mod_x = 2`, `mod_y = 1`
    - Required `mod_x = 3`, `mod_y = 1` (not found in `freq`)
  - For `num = 4`: 
    - `mod_x = 4`, `mod_y = 4`
    - Required `mod_x = 1`, `mod_y = 4` (not found in `freq`)
  - For `num = 9`: 
    - `mod_x = 4`, `mod_y = 1`
    - Required `mod_x = 1`, `mod_y = 1` (not found in `freq`)
  - For `num = 6`: 
    - `mod_x = 1`, `mod_y = 0`
    - Required `mod_x = 4`, `mod_y = 0` (not found in `freq`)

- Final `beautiful_count = 2` (pairs: (1, 5) and (4, 6))

After verifying the logic and the example walkthrough, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.
