t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case is a list containing three integers n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a. The value of n is between 2 and 2 * 10^5, and the values of x and y are between 1 and 10^9. Each element in the list a is between 1 and 10^9.
