Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs. The main issues are:

1. **Modulo Calculation**: The program calculates `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` incorrectly. It should check if `num - required_mod_x` is divisible by `x` and `num - required_mod_y` is divisible by `y`.

2. **Frequency Counting**: The frequency counting logic is not correctly implemented to count the number of beautiful pairs. Specifically, it should check if there exists another element in the array that satisfies the conditions for being a beautiful pair with the current element.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        # Calculate the frequency of each element modulo x and y
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] = 0
            freq[(mod_x, mod_y)] += 1
        
        # Check for beautiful pairs
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (num - y) % x
            required_mod_y = (num - x) % y
            
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]
                
            # Avoid counting the same pair twice
            if (mod_x, mod_y) == (required_mod_x, required_mod_y):
                beautiful_count -= 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count // 2}')
        results.append(beautiful_count // 2)
    return results
```

This corrected version properly counts the number of beautiful pairs by checking the required modulo values and ensuring that each pair is counted only once.
