Output State: **`a` is a non-empty array (at least one element); `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to the variable `mod_y`. The initial values of `a` and `mod_x` remain unchanged. The variable `mod_x` is no longer relevant since it was defined in terms of `num` and `x`, but now `mod_y` is defined in terms of `num` and `y`.
