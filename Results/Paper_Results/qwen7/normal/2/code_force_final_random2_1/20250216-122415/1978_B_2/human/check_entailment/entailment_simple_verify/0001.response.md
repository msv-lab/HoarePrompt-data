### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Understanding the Problem
- We need to maximize the profit from selling `n` buns.
- The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins each.
- The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
- We need to find the value of `k` that maximizes the total profit.

#### Function `func_1`
- This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
- The formula used is:
  \[
  \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
  \]
- This formula correctly sums up the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining buns.

#### Function `func_2`
- This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
- It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of `n` and `b`.
- It iteratively narrows down the range of `k` using binary search.
- For each `mid`, it calculates the profit using `func_1` and compares it with the profit for `mid + 1`.
- It updates `max_profit` with the higher of the two profits and adjusts the search range accordingly.

#### Binary Search Logic
- The logic in `func_2` is correct. It uses binary search to efficiently find the optimal `k`.
- The condition `if profit_next > profit_mid:` ensures that we move towards the higher profit region.
- The condition `else:` ensures that we move towards the lower profit region.

#### Detailed Evaluation
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to `min(n, b)`. This ensures that the search space is valid.
   
2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the midpoint of the current search range.
   - `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are calculated using `func_1`.
   - `max_profit` is updated with the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
   - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1` to search in the upper half.
   - Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` to search in the lower half.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`.
   - At this point, `max_profit` holds the maximum profit found during the search.

#### Edge Cases
- When `k = 0`, the program correctly sets `max_profit` to `n * a`.
- When `k = n`, the program correctly sets `max_profit` to the sum of the modified prices from `b` to `b - n + 1`.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit, and the `func_1` function correctly calculates the profit for a given `k`.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
