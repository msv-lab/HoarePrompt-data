Output State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `low` is `mid + 1`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is unchanged, `profit_mid` is unchanged, `profit_next` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. The other variables (`max_profit`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, and `profit_next`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
