The loop condition is `low <= high`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must still hold true.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has checked whether `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid` and adjusted the search range accordingly. The variables involved in the loop condition are `low` and `high`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, both `low` and `high` must still satisfy the condition `low <= high`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `low` is still less than or equal to `high`.

State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and the profit calculated from the binary search process, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
