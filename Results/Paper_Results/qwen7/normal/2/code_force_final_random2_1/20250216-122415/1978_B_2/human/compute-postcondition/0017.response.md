Output State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)` updates `max_profit` to be the maximum value between its current value and `profit_mid`. All other variables (`low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, and `profit_next`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
