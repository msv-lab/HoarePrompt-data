Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can make by choosing an optimal number of buns to sell at a modified price. The modified price for the first \( k \) buns is \( b - (i-1) \) for the \( i \)-th bun, and the remaining buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Function 1 Analysis**: 
   - The function `func_1(k, n, a, b)` calculates the profit for selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n-k \) buns at the usual price.
   - The formula used is \( k \times b - k \times (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) \times a \).
     - \( k \times b \): Total revenue from the first \( k \) buns.
     - \( - k \times (k - 1) // 2 \): Adjustment for the decreasing price of the first \( k \) buns.
     - \( (n - k) \times a \): Revenue from the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2(n, a, b)` uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - It iteratively calculates the profit for the middle point `mid` and the next point `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater, it updates `low` to `mid + 1`; otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.

4. **Binary Search Correctness**:
   - The binary search correctly narrows down the optimal \( k \) by comparing the profits of two consecutive points.
   - The initial range \( [0, \min(n, b)] \) covers all possible values of \( k \).
   - The termination condition ensures that the search completes, and the final `max_profit` holds the highest profit found.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where \( k = 0 \) (all buns sold at the usual price) and \( k = \min(n, b) \) (first \( k \) buns sold at the modified price).

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit.

Correctness: **True**
