Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided solution uses binary search to find the optimal value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit. The function `func_1` calculates the profit for a given \( k \). The main function `func_2` performs a binary search between 0 and \(\min(n, b)\) to find the \( k \) that gives the maximum profit. This approach is efficient and correctly implements the logic to maximize the profit based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
