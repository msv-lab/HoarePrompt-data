Output State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`; `low` must be less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is (low + high) // 2; `high` is `mid - 1`; `profit_mid` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The code `high = mid - 1` updates the value of `high` to be one less than the current value of `mid`. All other variables (`max_profit`, `low`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, and `profit_next`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
