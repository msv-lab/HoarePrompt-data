Output State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and the profit calculated from the binary search process, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `profit_mid` to be the result of calling `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. This does not affect the values of `max_profit`, `low`, or `high`, nor does it change the value of `mid`. The only new variable introduced is `profit_mid`, which holds the result of the function call.
