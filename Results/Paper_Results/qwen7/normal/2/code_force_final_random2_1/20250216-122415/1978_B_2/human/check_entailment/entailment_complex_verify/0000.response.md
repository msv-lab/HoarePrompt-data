### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1` calculates the profit for a given `k` value. The formula used is:
\[ \text{Profit} = k \times b - k \times (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) \times a \]

This formula breaks down as follows:
- \( k \times b \): The total revenue from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price.
- \( - k \times (k - 1) // 2 \): This term adjusts the revenue from the first \( k \) buns to account for the decreasing price (i.e., the \( i \)-th bun is sold for \( b - i + 1 \) coins).
- \( (n - k) \times a \): The total revenue from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).

The formula is mathematically sound and correctly reflects the profit calculation for a given `k`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal `k` value that maximizes the profit. Here's the breakdown of the binary search logic:
1. Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of `n` and `b`.
2. Perform a binary search to find the optimal `k`:
   - Calculate the midpoint `mid`.
   - Compute the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1`.
   - Update `low` and `high` based on the comparison between the profits of `mid` and `mid + 1`.

The binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently. The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.

#### Overall Program Analysis:
1. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it calls `func_2` with the appropriate parameters.
3. `func_2` returns the maximum profit, which is printed.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case.

#### Annotations and Validation:
The annotations provided align with the program's logic and confirm that:
- `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for a given `k`.
- `func_2` correctly uses binary search to find the optimal `k` and returns the maximum profit.

The original assessment is accurate because:
- The program correctly implements the required logic.
- The binary search approach ensures efficient computation of the optimal `k`.
- The profit calculations are correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules.
