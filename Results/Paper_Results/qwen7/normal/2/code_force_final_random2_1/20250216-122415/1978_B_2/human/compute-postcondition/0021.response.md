Postcondition: **`max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.**
