Output State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and the profit calculated from the binary search process, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the profit for the next index (`mid + 1`) using the function `func_1`. The variables `max_profit`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `profit_mid` remain unchanged. The new variable `profit_next` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
