Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`.
- `b` is a string that is the sorted version of `s`.
- `c` is a string that is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order.
- `s` is updated to the input string.
- `a` is created as a set of unique characters from the input string `s`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
