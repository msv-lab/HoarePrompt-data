Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, `b` is a string that is the sorted version of `s`, `c` is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order, `s` is updated to the input string, `a` is created as a set of unique characters from the input string `s`, `b` is the sorted version of the input string `s`, `c` is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts because neither part changes the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `s` beyond what is already described in the precondition. Therefore, the overall postcondition is identical to the precondition.
