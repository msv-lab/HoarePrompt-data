You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking for Single Character Repetition:**
   - It converts the string `s` into a set `a`. A set removes duplicate characters.
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same, making it impossible to rearrange `s` to form a different string `r`.
     - In this case, it prints "NO".

3. **Generating a Different String `r`:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are at least two different characters in `s`.
     - It sorts the string `s` in both ascending (`b`) and descending (`c`) order.
     - If the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`, it means sorting in ascending order did not change the string, so it sorts in descending order (`c`) and prints it.
     - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string in ascending order (`b`).

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Sorting and Rearranging:**
   - The logic to generate a different string `r` by sorting in ascending and descending order does not always produce a valid different string `r`. For example, for the input `"aaa"`, both sorting methods will result in `"aaa"`, which is the same as the original string.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program fails to handle cases where the string `s` has more than one distinct character but cannot be rearranged to form a different string `r`. For example, for the input `"abab"`, the program will incorrectly print "NO" because it checks if the sorted string is the same as the original, which is true for both ascending and descending sorts.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that we can always generate a different string `r` if possible. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            # Find the first character that appears more than once
            for char in s:
                if s.count(char) > 1:
                    # Swap the first occurrence of this character with the next occurrence
                    for j in range(1, len(s)):
                        if s[j] == char:
                            s = s[:j] + s[0] + s[1:j] + s[j+1:]
                            break
                    break
            print(s)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not always generate a valid different string `r`. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
