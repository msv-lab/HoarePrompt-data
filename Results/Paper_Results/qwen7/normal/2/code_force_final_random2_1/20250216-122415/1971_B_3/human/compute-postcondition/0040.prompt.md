Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of the set `a` is 1, no changes occur. Otherwise, `b` is a sorted string of `s`, and `c` is a string consisting of the characters of `s` sorted in descending order. No changes occur in either case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, `b` is a string that is the sorted version of `s`, and `c` is a string that is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, `b` is a string that is the sorted version of `s`, `c` is a string that is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order, `s` is updated to the input string, `a` is created as a set of unique characters from the input string `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
