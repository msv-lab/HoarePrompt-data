Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 999\); `s` is a positive integer within this range, and if the length of `s` is 1, `s` remains unchanged; otherwise, `s` is rotated by one character to the left; `s2` is a random permutation of the characters in `s`, and after the if-else block executes, if `s` equals `s2`, then `s2` is the string obtained by rotating `s` one character to the left. Otherwise, `s2` remains a random permutation of the characters in `s`.
