Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the string `s`.

2. **Generating a New String:**
   - The program generates a new string `s2` by shuffling the characters of `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))`.
   - This ensures that `s2` is a permutation of `s`.

3. **Checking for Equality:**
   - The program checks if `s` is not equal to `s2` using `if s != s2:`.
   - If they are not equal, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`.
   - If they are equal, it prints "No".

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs "Yes" and the new string `s2` when `s` and `s2` are different.
   - It outputs "No" when `s` and `s2` are the same.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles strings of length up to 10, which is within the specified limit.
   - For strings with all identical characters (like "aaaaa"), the generated `s2` will be the same as `s`, leading to "No" being printed.

6. **Randomness and Permutations:**
   - Using `random.sample` ensures that `s2` is a random permutation of `s`.
   - This approach guarantees that `s` and `s2` are different unless `s` has all identical characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to generate a new string `s2` that is a permutation of `s` and checks if `s` is not equal to `s2`. It handles all edge cases appropriately and follows the problem constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
