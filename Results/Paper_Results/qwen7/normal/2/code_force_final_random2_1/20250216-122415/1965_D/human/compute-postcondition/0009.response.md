Output State: `bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed, and `smallList` is a list of integers with its last three elements removed.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, both `bigList` and `smallList` will have had their respective last two and three elements removed, respectively, based on the conditions provided in the loop.
