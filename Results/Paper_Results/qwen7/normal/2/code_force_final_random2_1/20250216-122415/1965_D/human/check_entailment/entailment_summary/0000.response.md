Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem statement and the provided execution summaries of the functions. Let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing and Preprocessing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the subarray sums `subarraySums`.
   - The subarray sums are sorted.

2. **Identifying Missing Sum**:
   - The program uses the `func_2` function to identify unique sums.
   - Depending on the count of unique sums, it either directly identifies the missing sum or uses additional functions to calculate it.

3. **Recovering the Palindrome Array**:
   - The program uses `func_3` to recover the palindrome array from the unique sums.
   - This function ensures that the resulting array is symmetric by setting elements based on the unique sums.

4. **Validation and Output**:
   - The program ensures that the recovered array is a palindrome and prints it.

Let's analyze the correctness of each part:

- **Function `func_1`**: This function computes the cumulative sums of the subarray sums. This is necessary to find the unique sums later.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function filters out duplicate sums, ensuring that only unique sums are considered.
- **Function `func_3`**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array using the unique sums. It correctly handles the symmetry requirement by setting elements based on the unique sums.
- **Function `func_4`**: This function helps in removing redundant elements from the lists during the recovery process.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summaries, the logic seems sound and should work as intended. The program correctly identifies the missing sum and reconstructs the palindrome array.

Correctness: **True**
