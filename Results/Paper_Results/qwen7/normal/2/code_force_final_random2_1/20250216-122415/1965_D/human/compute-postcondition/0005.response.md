Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, and `smallList` is a list of integers with the last two elements removed.**

Explanation: The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Since both `bigList` and `smallList` initially had their last element removed, after executing the code, `smallList` will have its last two elements removed in total.
