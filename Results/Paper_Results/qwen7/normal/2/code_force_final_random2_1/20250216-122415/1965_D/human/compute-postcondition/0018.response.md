Output State: **`x` is the second element of the list `odds`, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd, `prev` is equal to the first element of the list `odds`, `idx` is decremented by 1, `a[idx]` is updated to \((x - prev) // 2\), `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to \((x - prev) // 2\)**.

Explanation: The code updates the element at index `n - 1 - idx` in the list `a` to the value \((x - prev) // 2\). The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `idx` is decremented by 1, and the value of `a[idx]` is also updated to \((x - prev) // 2\). The value of `a[n - 1 - idx]` is now \((x - prev) // 2\).
