Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, and `smallList` is a list of integers with the last element removed**.

Explanation: The code `bigList.pop()` removes the last element from `bigList`. Since the initial state mentions that `bigList`'s last element matches the last element of `smallList`, removing the last element from `bigList` maintains the condition that `bigList`'s new last element matches `smallList`'s last element. Additionally, the problem statement also mentions that `smallList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, which remains unchanged by the code.
