Output State: The variable `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is `len(a) + 1`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `a` as they are added to `sm`.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` remains unchanged as it was set initially to the length of `a` and does not change within the loop. The variable `j` increments by 1 in each iteration but will always be `len(a) + 1` after the loop since the loop condition `j < len(a)` will no longer be satisfied once `j` reaches `len(a)`. The variable `sm` accumulates the sum of all elements in `a` during the loop iterations. The list `cts` contains the cumulative sums at each step, starting from 0 (since `sm` starts at 0) and ending with the total sum of `a`.
