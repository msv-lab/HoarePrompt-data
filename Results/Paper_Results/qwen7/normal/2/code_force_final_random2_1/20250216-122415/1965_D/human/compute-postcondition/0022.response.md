Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in odds:`. This means the variable `x` is being iterated over the list `odds`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is the second element of the list `odds`.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd.
   - `prev` is equal to `x`.
   - `idx` is `idx - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `odds` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is being assigned the next element from the list `odds`, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the list.
   - `prev` will be the value of `x` from the previous iteration.
   - `idx` will be decremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `x` will be the third element of the list `odds` (since it was the second element before and now moves to the next).
- `prev` will be the value of `x` from the previous iteration, which is the second element of the list `odds`.
- `idx` will be `idx - 1` from its previous value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`x` is the third element of the list `odds`, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd, `prev` is equal to the second element of the list `odds`, `idx` is `idx - 1`**.
