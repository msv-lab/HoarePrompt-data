Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is `len(a) + 1`, `sm` is an error or undefined because `a[j]` refers to an index that is out of range, `cts` is a list containing `sm` and `sm` appended to it, `sm` is an error or undefined because `a[j]` refers to an index that is out of range.**

Explanation: The code attempts to add `a[j]` to `sm`. However, since `j` is `len(a) + 1`, it refers to an index that is out of range for the list `a`. Therefore, `sm` remains an error or undefined, and `cts` still contains `sm` twice.
