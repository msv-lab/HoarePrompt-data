You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
    cts.sort()
    return cts

#Function 2:
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
    return odds

#Function 3:
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        prev = x
        idx = idx - 1
    return a

#Function 4:
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        smallList.pop()
    return bigList[-1]



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function accepts two lists, `bigList` and `smallList`. It removes the last two elements from `bigList` and the last three elements from `smallList` if the last elements of both lists are equal. Finally, it returns the second last element of the original `bigList`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly recovers a possible palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - This function computes all subarray sums of the input array `a`.
   - It iterates through all possible subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of the array.
   - It appends the sum of each subarray to the list `cts`.
   - Finally, it sorts the list `cts`.

2. **Function `func_2(cts)`**:
   - This function aims to identify the unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - It iterates through the sorted list `cts` and maintains a list `odds` of unique sums.
   - If the current sum `ct` is the same as the last element in `odds`, it removes the last element (to remove the duplicate).
   - Otherwise, it appends the current sum to `odds`.

3. **Function `func_3(odds, n)`**:
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It sets the middle element (if `n` is odd) or the two middle elements (if `n` is even) based on the unique sums.
   - It fills the remaining elements symmetrically around the middle.

4. **Function `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**:
   - This function is not used in the provided solution and seems unnecessary for the problem at hand.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - This function correctly computes all subarray sums and sorts them. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_2(cts)`**:
   - This function attempts to find unique subarray sums by removing duplicates. However, it does not account for the fact that some sums might appear more than twice (e.g., `[1, 1, 2]` has a subarray sum of 2 appearing three times). This function will incorrectly remove these duplicates, leading to an incomplete set of unique sums.

3. **Function `func_3(odds, n)`**:
   - This function tries to reconstruct the palindrome array using the unique subarray sums. However, without the correct set of unique sums, the reconstruction may not be accurate. The function assumes that the unique sums are sufficient to reconstruct the palindrome, which is not always true due to the issues in `func_2`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program has logical flaws, particularly in how it handles the unique subarray sums. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: **False**
