You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 1000000000 500000000 500000000 1000000000

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
    cts.sort()
    return cts

#Function 2:
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
    return odds

#Function 3:
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        prev = x
        idx = idx - 1
    return a

#Function 4:
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        smallList.pop()
    return bigList[-1]



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function accepts two lists, `bigList` and `smallList`. It removes the last two elements from `bigList` and the last three elements from `smallList` if the last elements of both lists are equal. Finally, it returns the second last element of the original `bigList`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Let's consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  4
  10 12 14 16 8 12 14
  ```

- Expected output:
  ```
  2 4 4 2
  ```

However, running the provided functions with the input will not produce the correct result. Here’s why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all subarray sums and sorts them. It works correctly in generating the subarray sums.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to remove duplicate subarray sums. However, it does not handle the case where the last element of the sorted list is a duplicate. For the given input, the sorted list of subarray sums would be `[8, 10, 12, 12, 14, 14, 16]`. After removing duplicates, the list becomes `[8, 10, 12, 14, 16]`. The last element `16` is not removed, which means the last subarray sum is not correctly handled.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array from the unique subarray sums. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the last subarray sum is not correctly removed. As a result, the reconstructed array may not be a valid palindrome.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the solution and is irrelevant to the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly recover the palindrome array for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
