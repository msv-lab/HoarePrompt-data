Output State: `bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed, and `smallList` is a list of integers with its last three elements removed.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, both `bigList` and `smallList` will have had their last two and three elements, respectively, removed. This means that `bigList` will have been shortened by two elements from its original length, and `smallList` will have been shortened by three elements from its original length.
