### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the annotated code and the original assessment. We need to ensure that the program correctly recovers a palindrome array from the given subarray sums.

#### Function `func_1`
This function generates all subarray sums and sorts them. It works correctly in generating the subarray sums.

#### Function `func_2`
This function removes duplicate subarray sums. However, the original assessment pointed out an issue with handling the last element of the sorted list. Let's verify this:

- Given the sorted list `[8, 10, 12, 12, 14, 14, 16]`, `func_2` should remove duplicates and leave `[8, 10, 12, 14, 16]`. The last element `16` is not a duplicate, so it should remain.

#### Function `func_3`
This function reconstructs the palindrome array from the unique subarray sums. The logic in `func_3` is as follows:
- Initialize an array `a` of size `n` with zeros.
- Use the unique subarray sums to fill in the values symmetrically around the center.
- Ensure that the array is symmetric by setting `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` to the same value when `idx` is not the middle index.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how `func_3` works:
- `a` is initialized to all zeros.
- `prev` keeps track of the previous value in `odds`.
- `idx` is set to the middle index of the array.
- For each unique subarray sum `x` in `odds`:
  - If `idx` is the middle index, set `a[idx]` to `x`.
  - Otherwise, set both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` to `(x - prev) // 2`.
  - Update `prev` to `x`.
  - Decrement `idx`.

This ensures that the array is symmetric and correctly filled based on the unique subarray sums.

#### Function `func_4`
This function is not used in the main logic and is irrelevant to the problem.

### Re-evaluation of the Original Assessment

The original assessment correctly identified that `func_2` might not handle the last element correctly. However, upon closer inspection, `func_2` does handle the last element correctly by removing duplicates. The issue lies in the subsequent steps where the palindrome array is reconstructed.

Given the correct logic in `func_3` and the proper handling of subarray sums, the program should work as intended. The original assessment might have overlooked the correct implementation of `func_3`.

### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the program and the annotated code, we find that the program correctly recovers a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. The original assessment was overly critical of `func_2` without considering the overall correctness of the reconstruction process in `func_3`.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
