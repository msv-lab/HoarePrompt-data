You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array, and the length of a is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) where \(n\) is the size of the unknown palindrome array a.
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is `len(a) + 1`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `a` as they are added to `sm`.
    #
    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` remains unchanged as it was set initially to the length of `a` and does not change within the loop. The variable `j` increments by 1 in each iteration but will always be `len(a) + 1` after the loop since the loop condition `j < len(a)` will no longer be satisfied once `j` reaches `len(a)`. The variable `sm` accumulates the sum of all elements in `a` during the loop iterations. The list `cts` contains the cumulative sums at each step, starting from 0 (since `sm` starts at 0) and ending with the total sum of `a`.
    cts.sort()
    return cts
    #The program returns a sorted list of cumulative sums of all elements in list 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list 'a' containing integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array. The length of 'a' is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\), where \(n\) is the size of the unknown palindrome array. The function returns a sorted list of cumulative sums of all elements in list 'a'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a sorted list of cumulative sums of all elements in list 'a'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
