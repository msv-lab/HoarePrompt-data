Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is `len(a) + 1`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `a` as they are added to `sm`, and `cts` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `cts.sort()` sorts the list `cts` in ascending order. Since `cts` originally contained the cumulative sums of all elements in `a` as they were added to `sm`, sorting it does not change its content but arranges the elements in ascending order. The values of `i`, `j`, `sm`, and `cts` remain as they were before the sort operation.
