Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cts` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array, and the length of `a` is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    sm = 0
    for j in range(i, len(a)):
        sm = sm + a[j]
        cts.append(sm)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The list `a` must have at least one element, `i` is a non-negative integer and less than the length of `a`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, and `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of these elements as they are added to `sm`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `sm` will hold the total sum of all elements in `a` starting from index `i` to the last element of the list, and `cts` will contain each intermediate sum accumulated during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is one past the last index of `a`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `a` as they are added to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is `len(a) + 1`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `a` as they are added to `sm`.

In this final state, `i` remains unchanged as it was set initially to the length of `a` and does not change within the loop. The variable `j` increments by 1 in each iteration but will always be `len(a) + 1` after the loop since the loop condition `j < len(a)` will no longer be satisfied once `j` reaches `len(a)`. The variable `sm` accumulates the sum of all elements in `a` during the loop iterations. The list `cts` contains the cumulative sums at each step, starting from 0 and ending with the total sum of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
