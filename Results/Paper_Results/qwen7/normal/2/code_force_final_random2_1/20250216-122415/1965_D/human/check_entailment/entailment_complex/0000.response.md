Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the cumulative sums of all subarray sums and returns them sorted. This part is correctly implemented and ensures that we get a sorted list of cumulative sums.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function identifies unique subarray sums by removing duplicates. This is done by checking if the current element is the same as the last element in the `odds` list before appending it. This ensures that each unique subarray sum is only included once.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array from the unique subarray sums. It correctly handles the symmetry of the palindrome by setting elements symmetrically around the center. This function is crucial for generating a valid palindrome array.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function removes the last two elements from `bigList` and the last three elements from `smallList` if they are equal. It then returns the second last element of the original `bigList`. This function is used to find the missing subarray sum.

Given the problem constraints and the provided functions, the overall logic of the main program seems sound. Here's how it works:

- It sorts the subarray sums and identifies unique ones.
- It uses these unique sums to reconstruct a potential palindrome array.
- It finds the missing subarray sum using the relationship between the cumulative sums and the unique sums.
- It ensures the palindrome property by constructing the array symmetrically.

Since the problem guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution and the provided functions seem to correctly implement the necessary steps to solve the problem, the program should be correct under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
