Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in odds:`. The variables involved here are `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is the first element of the list `odds`.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd.
   - `prev` is equal to `x`.
   - `idx` is decreased by 1.
   - `a` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand what happens in each iteration**:
   - In the current iteration, `x` takes the value of the first element of the list `odds`.
   - After the iteration, `x` will take the next element from the list `odds`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is now set to the next element in the list `odds`, the new value of `x` will be the second element of the list `odds`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `prev` will now be equal to the new value of `x` (which was the first element in the previous iteration).
   - `idx` is decreased by 1, so it will be decremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `a` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `x` will be the second element of the list `odds`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `prev` will be the first element of the list `odds` (since `x` was the first element in the previous iteration).
   - `idx` will be decremented by 1.
   - `a` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`x` is the second element of the list `odds`, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd, `prev` is equal to the first element of the list `odds`, `idx` is decremented by 1, `a` remains unchanged**.
