Output State: **`x` is the third element of the list `odds`, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd, `prev` is equal to `x`, `idx` is `idx - 1`, and either `a[idx]` is assigned the value of `x`, or `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to \((x - prev) // 2`, `idx` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `idx = idx - 1` simply decreases the value of `idx` by 1. All other variables (`x`, `n`, `prev`, `a[idx]`, and `a[n - 1 - idx]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
