Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `mexsize` is incremented for each element in the list `a` that matches its current value of `mexsize`.
   - The final value of `mexsize` will be one more than the last element in the list `a` if all elements in `a` match their respective `mexsize` values during the loop iterations.
   - The list `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `sz` will be the last element of the list `a` after the loop completes.
   - `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the value of `mexsize`:

- If all elements in `a` match their respective `mexsize` values, then `mexsize` will be incremented until it becomes one more than the last element in `a`.
- Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, let's assume the last element of `a` is `sz`. Therefore, the final value of `mexsize` will be `sz + 1`.

Now, let's evaluate the expression `mexsize % 2 == 1`:
- If `mexsize` is odd, the expression evaluates to `True`, and the print statement will output `'Alice'`.
- If `mexsize` is even, the expression evaluates to `False`, and the print statement will output `'Bob'`.

Since `mexsize` is defined as `sz + 1` and `sz` is the last element of the list `a`, `mexsize` will always be an odd number because `sz` is an integer and adding 1 to an integer results in an odd number.

Therefore, the expression `mexsize % 2 == 1` will always evaluate to `True`.

Output: **Alice**
