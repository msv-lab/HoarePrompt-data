Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `mexsize` is one more than the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `sz` is the last element of the list `a`, which means `sz` is equal to `maxsize` since `a` is sorted.
   - `tc` is `t - 1`, but this variable is not used in the print statement.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.

2. **Given Information:**
   - The current value of `mexsize` is greater than the current value of `maxsize`.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement checks if `mexsize` is even (`mexsize % 2 == 0`) and prints "Alice" if it is, otherwise it prints "Bob".

4. **Determine the Value of `mexsize`:**
   - Since `mexsize` is one more than the maximum value in the list `a`, and it is stated that `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, `mexsize` must be an odd number (because if it were even, it wouldn't be greater than `maxsize`).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `mexsize` is odd, `mexsize % 2 == 0` evaluates to `False`.
   - Therefore, the print statement will print "Bob".

Output: **Bob**
