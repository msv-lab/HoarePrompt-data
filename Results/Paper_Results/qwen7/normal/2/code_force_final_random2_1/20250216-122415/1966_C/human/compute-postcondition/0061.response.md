Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `sz` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. The variable `sz` takes on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration.

3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The list `a` is already given as a sorted list of integers.
   - The variable `sz` will take on the value of each element in `a` during the loop iterations.
   - The variable `mexsize` is initially set to 1 and is supposed to be updated based on the loop iterations.
   - The variable `tc` is given as `t - 1`.
   - The variable `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `sz` will take on the value of each element in `a` during the loop, we need to ensure that `a` is non-empty (i.e., it has at least one element).
   - The variable `mexsize` is not directly set in the loop head but is updated during the loop iterations. However, we need to ensure that the loop can run at least once to update `mexsize`.
   - The variables `tc` and `maxsize` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they don't need to be adjusted here.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the list `a` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `mexsize` is 1, `sz` is the first element of the list `a`, `tc` is `t - 1`, and `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`**.
