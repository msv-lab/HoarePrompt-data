Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers. It iterates through a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given conditions, without exceeding a total n value of 2⋅10^5 across all test cases.**
