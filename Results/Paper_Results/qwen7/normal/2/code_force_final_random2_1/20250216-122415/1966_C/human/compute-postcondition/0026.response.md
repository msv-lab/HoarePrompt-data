Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `a` will still be a sorted list of integers, and `mexsize` will be incremented each time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`. The final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in `a`. If the current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, `mexsize` remains as the smallest positive integer not present in `a`. Otherwise, `mexsize` will be less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
