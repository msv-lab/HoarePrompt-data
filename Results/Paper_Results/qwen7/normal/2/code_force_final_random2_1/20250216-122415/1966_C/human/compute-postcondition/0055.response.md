Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `mexsize` is incremented for each element in the list `a` that matches its current value of `mexsize`. The final value of `mexsize` is one more than the last element in the list `a` if all elements in `a` match their respective `mexsize` values during the loop iterations. The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers, and `sz` is the last element of the list `a`. Whether `mexsize` is greater than or less than or equal to `maxsize`, the above conditions hold true. `tc` is `t - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`mexsize`, `a`, `sz`, `tc`, and `maxsize`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
