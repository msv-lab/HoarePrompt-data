Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 1**.

The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `mexsize`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `maxsize`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions from the initial state.
