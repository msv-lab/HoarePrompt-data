Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` remains as the smallest positive integer not present in `a`, `tc` is equal to the previous value of `tc` + 1, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. All other variables (`maxsize`, `mexsize`, `tc`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `a` is now a sorted list, while the other variables retain their original values.
