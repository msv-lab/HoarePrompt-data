Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `mexsize` is incremented each time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`.
- The final value of `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in `a`.
- The current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

Given this information, we need to determine whether `mexsize % 2 == 0` is true or false to decide what will be printed.

Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the sorted list `a`, and it is greater than `maxsize`, it means `mexsize` is a positive integer not found in `a`. The value of `mexsize` could be any positive integer, but it doesn't affect the condition `mexsize % 2 == 0` directly. The condition only depends on whether `mexsize` is even or odd.

Without knowing the exact value of `mexsize`, we can't definitively say if it's even or odd. However, the problem does not require us to know the exact value, just the result of the condition.

Therefore, the output will depend on whether `mexsize` is even or odd. If `mexsize` is even, "Alice" will be printed; if `mexsize` is odd, "Bob" will be printed.

Output: **Alice** or **Bob** (depending on whether `mexsize` is even or odd)
