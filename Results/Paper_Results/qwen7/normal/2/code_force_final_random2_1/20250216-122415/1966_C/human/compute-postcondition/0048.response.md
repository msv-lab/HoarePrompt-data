Postcondition: **`mexsize` is incremented for each element in the list `a` that matches its current value of `mexsize`. The final value of `mexsize` is one more than the last element in the list `a` if all elements in `a` match their respective `mexsize` values during the loop iterations. The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers, and `sz` is the last element of the list `a`. The current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.**
