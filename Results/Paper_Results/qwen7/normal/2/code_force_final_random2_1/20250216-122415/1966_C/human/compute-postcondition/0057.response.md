Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `mexsize` is incremented for each element in the list `a` that matches its current value of `mexsize`, the final value of `mexsize` is one more than the last element in the list `a` if all elements in `a` match their respective `mexsize` values during the loop iterations, the list `a` remains a sorted list of integers, `sz` is the last element of the list `a`, and `tc` is `t - 1`; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**

This output state reflects that the `maxsize` variable is now set to the maximum value found in the list `a`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
