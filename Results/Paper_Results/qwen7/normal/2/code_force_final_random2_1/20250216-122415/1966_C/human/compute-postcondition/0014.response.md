Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element; `mexsize` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `a` must contain at least one element. The code snippet increments `mexsize` by 1. Since the value of `mexsize` was not specified initially, we only know that it has been increased by 1. The condition for `a` remains unchanged.
