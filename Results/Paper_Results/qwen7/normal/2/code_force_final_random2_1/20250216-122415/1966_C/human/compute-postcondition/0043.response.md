Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `mexsize` is increased by 1 if `sz` equals `mexsize`. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged.
   - `sz` is still the second element in the list `a`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `sz` in the list `a`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `sz` and `a`.
   - Since `sz` is the second element in the list `a` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `sz` will be the third element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` remains the same unless the loop modifies it, but since no such modification is mentioned, `a` stays as a sorted list of integers.

4. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `mexsize` remains unchanged from the previous iteration unless `sz` equals `mexsize` in this new iteration.
   - `sz` becomes the third element in the list `a`.
   - `a` remains a sorted list of integers.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

**State: **`mexsize` remains unchanged, `sz` is the third element in the list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers**.
