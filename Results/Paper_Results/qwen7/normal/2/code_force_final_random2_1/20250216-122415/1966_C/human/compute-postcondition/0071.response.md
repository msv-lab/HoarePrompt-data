Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `mexsize` is 4, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`, `tc` is `t - 1`, and `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code increments `mexsize` by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
