Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `sz` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `sz` in the list `a`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element.
   - `mexsize` is 3.
   - `sz` is the next element in the list `a`.
   - `tc` is `t - 1`.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `sz` is the next element in the list `a`, after processing the current `sz`, the next `sz` will be the subsequent element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged as the loop simply iterates through its elements.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `sz` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `a` remains the same list.
   - `mexsize`, `tc`, and `maxsize` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `mexsize` is 3, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`, `tc` is `t - 1`, and `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`**.
