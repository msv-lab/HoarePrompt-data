Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `sz` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `a`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `a` must contain at least one element, and `mexsize` is increased by 1 if `sz` equals `mexsize`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `a` still contains at least one element.
   - If `sz` equals `mexsize` during the current iteration, `mexsize` should be incremented.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `a` still contains at least one element, and `mexsize` is increased by 1 if `sz` equals `mexsize`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must contain at least one element, and `mexsize` is increased by 1 if `sz` equals `mexsize`**
