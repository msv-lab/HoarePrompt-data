Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` is 1, the final value of `mexsize` is one more than the last element in the list `a` if all elements in `a` match their respective `mexsize` values during the loop iterations, `sz` is the last element of the list `a`, and `tc` is `t - 1`; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code sets `mexsize` to 1. This initializes `mexsize` to 1 regardless of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
