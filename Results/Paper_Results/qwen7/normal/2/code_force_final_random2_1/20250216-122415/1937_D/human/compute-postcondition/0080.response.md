Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**.

This means that the variable `zeroInd` has been assigned the value of `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`. The values of `ol` (which is `totalOne`) and `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
