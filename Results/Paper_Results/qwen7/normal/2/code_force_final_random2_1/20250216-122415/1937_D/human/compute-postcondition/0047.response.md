Output State: **`totalOne` is `len(pre) - 1`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-5`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr), ans[i] is zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi**.

Explanation: The line `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. The value of `i` is decremented by 1 (from `n-4` to `n-5`). All other variables remain unchanged. The function `func_1` is called with arguments `preOne, zr + 1` and `preOne, zr`, and the difference between these two calls is used to calculate `oneInd`.
