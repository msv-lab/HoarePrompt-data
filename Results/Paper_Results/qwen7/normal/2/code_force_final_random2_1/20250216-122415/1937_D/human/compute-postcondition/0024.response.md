Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and 1 (since `suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)` and initially `suffZero` contains 0, and `i` is `n-2`), `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1` and is not '>'**.

This means that the list `suffZero` now contains two elements: 0 and 1. All other variables remain unchanged except for `i`, which is decremented by 1, and `suffZero` which has been updated.
