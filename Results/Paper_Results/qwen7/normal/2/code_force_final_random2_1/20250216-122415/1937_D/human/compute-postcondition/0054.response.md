Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and appended with `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is 2 * `func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` to `oneInd`. Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `oneInd`, but we know it is twice the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
