Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `el` is '>', `totalOne` remains the same, `s1`, `pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `el` becomes the character at index `n-1` in `s1`. If `el` is not '>', `totalOne` remains the same, `s1`, `pre`, `preOne`, and `suffZero` remain unchanged, `i` decreases by 1, `el` becomes the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, and `ans[i]` is calculated based on the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` as specified in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 2 if the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>', otherwise it is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1. `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `pre` is a list of integers where each integer `i + 1` is added to the list if the character at index `i` in `s1` is '>'. `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element. `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and appended with `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise it remains as a list containing 0. `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`. `i` is `n-4` if the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>', otherwise it is `n-3`. `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`. `ol` is `totalOne` if the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>', otherwise it is `totalOne`. `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `ans[i]` is calculated based on the following conditions: if `el == '>'`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` where `zeroInd` is 2 times the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise it is 2 times the last element of `suffZero`; `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` minus `func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `fi` is the difference between `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` and `func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `el != '>'`, then `zeroInd` is either `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` or `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, and `oneInd` is either `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` or `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` or `zeroInd - oneInd`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
