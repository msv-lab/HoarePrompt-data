Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_2` accurately calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query based on the rules provided.

1. **Initialization and Preprocessing**:
   - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
   - `totalOne` is the count of these indices.
   - `preOne` is the prefix sum of `pre`.
   - `suffZero` is initialized to `[0]`.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - For each index `i` from `n-1` to `0`, the code checks if the character at `i` is '>'.
     - If true, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid considering the counts of '>' and '<' to the left and right of `i`.
     - If false, it updates `suffZero` and recalculates the time similarly but considering the counts of '<' and '>' to the left and right of `i`.

3. **Calculations**:
   - The calculations involve using the prefix sums (`preOne`) and suffix sums (`suffZero`) to determine the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - These calculations ensure that the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters are correctly accounted for.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the count of '>' or '<' to the left or right is less than or equal to the other, ensuring the correct time is calculated.
   - The complex calculations involving cumulative sums handle more intricate scenarios where both conditions are not met.

Given the detailed and structured approach in `func_2`, it appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The preprocessing steps and the main loop correctly account for the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters.

Correctness: **True**
