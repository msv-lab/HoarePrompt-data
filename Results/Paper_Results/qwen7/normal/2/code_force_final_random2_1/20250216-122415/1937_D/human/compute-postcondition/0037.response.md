Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i`, `el`, `ol`, and `zr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs in reverse order from `n-1` to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, and `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is running in reverse, the next value of `i` would be `n-3`.
   - `el` remains the same as it is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`.
   - `ol` (which is `totalOne`) remains the same.
   - `zr` remains the same as it is derived from `suffZero`.

Given these points, let's update the states accordingly.

**Step-by-Step Adjustment**:
- `i` decreases by 1 from `n-2` to `n-3`.
- `el` remains the same.
- `ol` remains the same.
- `zr` remains the same.

**Final State**:
State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1**.
