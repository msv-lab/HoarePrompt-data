Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement Duration**: The function `func_2` attempts to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid based on the direction of the arrows ('<' or '>') and their changes. However, the logic inside the function is flawed and does not accurately reflect the movement rules described in the problem statement.

2. **Misuse of Accumulate Function**: The `accumulate` function is used incorrectly. The purpose of `accumulate` is to compute the cumulative sum of a sequence, but in this context, it is being used to manage indices and counts in a way that does not align with the problem requirements.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Directions and Indices**: The logic for determining the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is overly complex and does not properly account for the inversion of directions and the movement rules. Specifically, the conditions for calculating `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are not correctly implemented and do not reflect the actual movement of the pinball.

4. **Output of Zeros**: The final output is a list of zeros, which indicates that the program is not correctly calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
