The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`. It calculates and prints a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element is determined based on the positions of '>' and '<' in `s1`. Specifically, for each position `i` in `s1`, the value in `ans[i]` is computed using the counts of '>' and '<' characters to the left and right of position `i`. If the count of '>' characters to the left is less than or equal to the count of '<' characters to the right, or vice versa, the value in `ans[i]` is calculated accordingly. If neither condition is met, a more complex calculation involving cumulative sums is performed. After processing all positions in `s1`, the function prints a list of zeros of length `n`.
