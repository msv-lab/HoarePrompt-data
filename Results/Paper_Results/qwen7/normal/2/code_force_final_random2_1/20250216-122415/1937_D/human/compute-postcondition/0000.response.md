Output State: **`s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>'**.

This means that the variable `pre` now contains a list of positions (indices + 1) in the string `s1` where the character is '>'. All other variables remain in their initial state, specifically, `s1` remains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
