You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^5).

    pre = [(i + 1) for i, el in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
    totalOne = len(pre)

    suffZero = [0]
    ans = [0] * n

            totalOne -= 1
        else:

            if zr <= ol:
                zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)

    #State: Output State: `totalOne` is equal to 0, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer `i + 1` is added to the list if the character at index `i` in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without any elements (since `totalOne` is 0), `suffZero` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all indices `i + 1` for each character '<' in `s1` from the end to the beginning, `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`, and `i` is -1 (indicating the loop has completed all its iterations).
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `totalOne` will be 0 because it is decremented in each iteration until it reaches 0. The `pre` list will be modified according to the characters in `s1`, and `preOne` will be a list of cumulative sums of `pre` but will be empty since `totalOne` is 0. The `suffZero` list will contain the cumulative sum of all indices `i + 1` for each character '<' in `s1` from the end to the beginning, and `ans` will be a list of zeros of length `n` because no value is assigned to any index in `ans` during the loop's execution. The variable `i` will be -1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: 0 0 0 ... 0 (n times)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`.
