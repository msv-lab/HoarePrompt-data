Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the character at index `i` (which is `n-1`) in `s1` to the variable `el`. Since `i` was initially `n-1`, after executing `el = s1[i]`, `i` is decremented by 1, making it `n-2`. The value of `el` is now the character at index `n-1` in `s1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
