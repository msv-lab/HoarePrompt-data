Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the current value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the current length of `suffZero` minus 1 to `zr`. Since `suffZero` contains only one element (0), `zr` is calculated as 0 - 1, which results in -1. However, since the length of a list cannot be negative, `zr` is effectively 0. The values of `totalOne`, `s1`, `pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, and `ol` remain unchanged.
