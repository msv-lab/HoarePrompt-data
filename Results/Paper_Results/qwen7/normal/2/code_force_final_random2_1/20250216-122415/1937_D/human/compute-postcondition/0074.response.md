Output State: **`totalOne` is now equal to the length of `pre` minus 3 if the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>', otherwise it is equal to the length of `pre` minus 2; `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers where each integer `i + 1` is added to the list if the character at index `i` in `s1` is '>'; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element (last element removed); `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and appended with `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise it remains as a list containing 0; `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`; `i` is `n-5` if the character at index `n-1` in `s1` is '>', otherwise it is `n-4`; `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`; `ol` is now `totalOne`; `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`; if `ol <= zr`, `zeroInd` is 2 times the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, otherwise `zeroInd` is 2 times the last element of `suffZero`; `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` minus `func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is the difference between `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` and `func_1(preOne, zr)`; `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.**

Explanation: The line `totalOne -= 1` decreases the value of `totalOne` by 1. The conditions and calculations for the other variables remain unchanged.
