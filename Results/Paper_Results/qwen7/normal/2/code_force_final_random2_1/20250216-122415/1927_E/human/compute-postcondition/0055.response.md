Output State: `i` is 2, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 * (k/2) + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`, and `len(permutation)` is at least `k * (k/2) + 1`.

**Explanation:**
- The loop iterates `k` times, and for each iteration `i`, it updates the `permutation` list at indices that are multiples of `k + i`.
- After `k` iterations, the loop will have filled all necessary indices in the `permutation` list that are multiples of `k`.
- The variable `i` will be `k - 1` after the last iteration, but since the loop uses `i` in the range `range(k)`, `i` will be `k - 1` just before the loop exits.
- `curr_v` starts at `len(permutation) + 1` and increments by 1 for each assignment made in the inner while loop. Since the loop runs `k` times and each time it makes `n // k` assignments (assuming `n` is large enough), `curr_v` will be `len(permutation) + k * (n // k)`.
- Given that `k` is even and the loop runs `k` times, the total number of assignments is `k * (n // k)`, leading to `curr_v` being `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 * (k/2) + 1` if we assume the worst-case scenario where `n` is just enough to fill all required indices.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `len(permutation)` because the loop exits when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than `len(permutation)`.
- `idx_v` remains `len(permutation)` because it is updated to the length of the `permutation` list after each assignment.
- `permutation` will have consecutive integers starting from 2 at all indices that are multiples of `k`, and the length of `permutation` will be at least `k * (k/2) + 1` to ensure all necessary indices are filled.
