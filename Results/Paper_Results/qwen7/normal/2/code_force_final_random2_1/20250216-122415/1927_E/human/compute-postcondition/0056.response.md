Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 * (k/2) + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`, and `result` is a string containing space-separated integers from the `permutation` list.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `k` times, updating the `permutation` list at indices that are multiples of `k + i`. After the loop, `i` is `k - 1`.
- `curr_v` is calculated as `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 * (k/2) + 1`, which means it is the length of the `permutation` list plus twice three times half of `k` plus one.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is equal to `len(permutation)` because the loop exits when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than `len(permutation)`.
- `idx_v` remains `len(permutation)` because it is updated to the length of the `permutation` list after each assignment.
- `permutation` contains consecutive integers starting from 2 at all indices that are multiples of `k`.
- `result` is a string created by joining the elements of the `permutation` list with spaces.
