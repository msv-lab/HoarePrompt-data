Output State: **`len(permutation)` is greater than 4; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is equal to `curr_v + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and the relationship between `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` and `curr_v` remain the same as the initial state.
