State right before the while loop: `t` is an input integer, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and `k` is even.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. The only variable in the loop head is `t`.
3. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is described as "an input integer," and for each test case, `t` should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
