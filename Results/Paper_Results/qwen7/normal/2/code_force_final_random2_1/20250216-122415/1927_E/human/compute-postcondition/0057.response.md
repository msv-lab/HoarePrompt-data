Let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. `i` is `k - 1`.
2. `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`.
3. `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2.
4. `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`.
5. `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 * (k/2) + 1`.
6. `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`.
7. `result` is a string containing space-separated integers from the `permutation` list.

Given these details, let's determine the contents of the `permutation` list and the `result` string:

- Since `k` is an even integer and `k < n`, let's assume `k = 4` (a common small even number for simplicity).
- The indices that are multiples of `k` (which is 4) will be filled with consecutive integers starting from 2.
- If `n` is greater than 4, the `permutation` list will have at least the indices 0, 4, 8, etc., filled with 2, 3, 4, etc.

For example, if `n = 10`, the `permutation` list might look like this: `[_, _, _, 2, _, _, _, 3, _, _, 4]`.

- `idx_v` is the length of the `permutation` list.
- `curr_v` is calculated as `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 * (k/2) + 1`. For `k = 4`, this becomes `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 * (4/2) + 1 = len(permutation) + 13`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is the same as `len(permutation)`.

Given that `i = k - 1`, for `k = 4`, `i = 3`.

The `result` string contains space-separated integers from the `permutation` list. Since the only filled indices are multiples of `k`, the `result` will contain the integers 2, 3, 4, etc., depending on the length of the `permutation` list.

Assuming `n = 10` for simplicity, the `permutation` list would be `[_, _, _, 2, _, _, _, 3, _, _, 4]`, and the `result` would be `"2 3 4"`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(result)` statement will be:

Output: **2 3 4**
