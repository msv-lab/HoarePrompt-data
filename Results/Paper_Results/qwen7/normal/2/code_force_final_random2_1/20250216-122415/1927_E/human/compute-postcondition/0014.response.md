Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is [2, 1, 0, ..., 0], `idx_v` is 2, `curr_v` is 3, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2k`**

Explanation: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was initially set to `k`. After executing the line `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k`, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is updated to `k + k`, which simplifies to `2k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
