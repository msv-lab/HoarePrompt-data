Output State: **`len(permutation)` is greater than 4; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is equal to `curr_v`**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` from `curr_v + 1` to `curr_v`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is now directly equal to `curr_v`.
