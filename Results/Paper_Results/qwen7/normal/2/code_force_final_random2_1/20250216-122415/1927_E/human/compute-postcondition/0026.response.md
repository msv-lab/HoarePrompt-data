Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2, `len(permutation)` must be at least 2**.

Explanation: The code `curr_v += 1` increments the value of `curr_v` by 1. Initially, `curr_v` was equal to `len(permutation) + 1`. After the increment, `curr_v` becomes `len(permutation) + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
