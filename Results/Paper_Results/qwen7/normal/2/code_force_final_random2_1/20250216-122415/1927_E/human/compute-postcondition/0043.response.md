Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 2, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 9, `len(permutation)` is at least 10, `permutation[7]` is 13**

Explanation: The code `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Given that `k` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which was initially 7) is updated to 9. All other variables remain unchanged.
