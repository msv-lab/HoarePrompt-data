Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 3 * k`, `len(permutation)` is at least `4 + 2*k`**.

Explanation: The code `multiples_of_k_plus_i = i` changes the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to the current value of `i`, which is 2. However, since `i` is updated to 1 in the assignment, the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
