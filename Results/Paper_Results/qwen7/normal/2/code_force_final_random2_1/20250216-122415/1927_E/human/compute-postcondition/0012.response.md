Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even. It does not return anything explicitly but processes the input and performs operations based on the given constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. The function checks if `k` is within the specified range and is even, and then processes these values according to the given constraints.
