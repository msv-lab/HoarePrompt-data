Output State: `i` is 0, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where every index that is a multiple of `k` (starting from `k`) is filled with consecutive integers starting from 2 up to `n`, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `n + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2k`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `permutation` list will have been filled such that every index that is a multiple of `k` (starting from `k`) contains consecutive integers starting from 2 up to `n`. The variable `idx_v` will be equal to the length of the `permutation` list, indicating that no more elements can be added. The `curr_v` will be `n + 1`, as it increments by 1 each time an element is placed in the `permutation` list. The `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `2k`, indicating that the loop condition was met exactly twice (since it increments by `k` each iteration).
