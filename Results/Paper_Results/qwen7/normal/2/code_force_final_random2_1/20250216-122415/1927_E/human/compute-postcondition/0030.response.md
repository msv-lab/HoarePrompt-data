Output State: **`len(permutation)` is greater than 4; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is equal to `curr_v + 1`**

Explanation: The code increments `curr_v` by 1. Since `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` was previously assigned the value of `curr_v`, it now gets updated to `curr_v + 1`. The length of the permutation and the condition that it is greater than 4 remain unchanged.
