Output State: `i` is 99, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2 * 99 + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`, `len(permutation)` is at least 198.

**Explanation:**
- The loop runs from `i` = 0 to `i` = 99, which means it executes 100 times.
- Each iteration of the loop fills the `permutation` list at indices that are multiples of `k` with consecutive integers starting from 2.
- After 100 iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `len(permutation)` because the loop exits when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than `len(permutation)`.
- Initially, `curr_v` is set to `len(permutation) + 1`. After 100 iterations, `curr_v` will be incremented by 100, making it `len(permutation) + 100 + 1` or `len(permutation) + 101`.
- Therefore, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 101` and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`, indicating that all relevant indices have been processed.

Since `k` is even and `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`, and considering the loop runs 100 times, `len(permutation)` must be at least `100k`. Given the constraints, if `k` is the maximum possible value (200,000), `len(permutation)` would still need to accommodate the loop running 100 times, ensuring `len(permutation)` is sufficiently large to hold all the values. Thus, `len(permutation)` is at least 198, considering the smallest possible `k` value (2) and the fact that the loop runs 100 times.
