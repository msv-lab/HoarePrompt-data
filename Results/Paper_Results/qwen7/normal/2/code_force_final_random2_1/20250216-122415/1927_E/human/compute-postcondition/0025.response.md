Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2, `len(permutation)` must be at least 2**

Explanation: The code updates `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` with `curr_v`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 1`, and `len(permutation)` is at least 2, `permutation[1]` (since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1) is set to `len(permutation) + 1`. Since `len(permutation)` is at least 2, `permutation[1]` is set to 3 (as `len(permutation) + 1` would be 3). All other variables remain unchanged.
