Output State: **`permutation'` is updated such that the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, all other variables retain their previous states.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `curr_v` by 1. The element at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the list `permutation` is updated to the new value of `curr_v`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
