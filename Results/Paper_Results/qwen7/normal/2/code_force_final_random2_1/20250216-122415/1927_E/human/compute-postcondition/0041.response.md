Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 2, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 3 * k`, `len(permutation)` is at least `4 + 2*k`, `permutation[1 + 3 * 2]` is `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 + 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the `permutation` list by setting the value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to `curr_v`. Given that `k` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is calculated as `1 + 3 * 2 = 7`. Also, `curr_v` is calculated as `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 + 1`. Therefore, `permutation[7]` is set to `len(permutation) + 7`. All other variables remain unchanged.
