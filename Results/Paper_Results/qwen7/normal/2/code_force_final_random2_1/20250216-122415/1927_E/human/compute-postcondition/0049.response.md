Output State: **`permutation'` is updated such that the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < len(permutation)`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`.**

This means that the element in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been set to `curr_v + 1`. The value of `curr_v` has been incremented by 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been increased by `k`. Additionally, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < len(permutation)` must still hold true.
