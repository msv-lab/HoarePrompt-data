Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `len(permutation)` is greater than 4.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k` (let's assume `k` is some integer).
   - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is equal to `curr_v + 1`.

3. **Check the loop condition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Given that `len(permutation)` is greater than 4, the loop can potentially execute again as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than `len(permutation)`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k` during each iteration, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is still less than `len(permutation)` for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)` at the start of the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to ensure it is less than `len(permutation)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`len(permutation)` is greater than 4; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is equal to `curr_v + 1`**
