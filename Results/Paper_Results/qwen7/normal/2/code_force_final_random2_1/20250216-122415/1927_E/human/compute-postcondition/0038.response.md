Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State Analysis
At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`
- `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2
- `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`
- `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`
- `len(permutation)` is at least `4 + 2*k`

### Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of `permutation`.

### Loop Body
- After each iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` increases by `k`.
- `curr_v` increases by 1.

Given that the loop executed 3 times:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 1 and increases by `k` each time.
- After 3 iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `1 + 3 * k`.
- Since the loop exits when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` equals the length of `permutation`, we can say `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is exactly `len(permutation)`.

### Adjusting States for Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`
   - `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2
   - `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`
   - `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`
   - `len(permutation)` is at least `4 + 2*k`

2. **After 3 Iterations:**
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`
   - To continue the loop, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`, so `i` must be incremented by 1.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will start at `1 + 3 * k` and increase by `k` in the next iteration.
   - `curr_v` will start at `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1` and increment by 1 in the next iteration.

### Final State for Next Iteration
- `i` will be 2
- `k` remains an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`
- `permutation` remains the same
- `idx_v` remains `len(permutation)`
- `curr_v` remains `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at `1 + 3 * k`
- `len(permutation)` remains at least `4 + 2*k`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 3 * k`, `len(permutation)` is at least `4 + 2*k`**
