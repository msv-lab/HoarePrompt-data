Output State: **The `letters` list is sorted in ascending order, the `digits` list remains sorted in ascending order, `i` is equal to `len(digits)`, and `sortedPassword` is a string formed by concatenating the `digits` list followed by the `letters` list.**

Explanation: The code snippet concatenates the `digits` list and the `letters` list into a single string `sortedPassword`. Since the lists were already sorted and the conditions were met, the concatenation results in a new string where all elements from `digits` are followed by all elements from `letters`. The values of `letters`, `digits`, and `i` remain unchanged as the operation does not affect them.
