Output State: **`password` is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and the first character of `password` is a lowercase Latin letter; `letters` is a list with one additional element `char`.**

Explanation: The code appends a character (`char`) to the list `letters`. Since `password` is initially a string of length between 1 and 20, and the first character is a lowercase Latin letter, appending a character does not change these properties. The length of `password` remains between 1 and 20, and the first character remains a lowercase Latin letter. The only change is that `letters` now contains one more element, which is `char`.
