Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `letters` list is sorted in ascending order. The `digits` list remains sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(digits)):
    if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
        return False
    if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
        return False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The `letters` list is sorted in ascending order, the `digits` list remains sorted in ascending order, `i` is 0, `len(digits)` is greater than 0, and either `i` is not less than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is not greater than `digits[i + 1]`, and `digits[-1] is less than or equal to letters[i]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is an integer, and the function returns False if `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1` and `digits[-1]` is greater than `letters[i]`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is an integer that is less than `len(digits)`. If `i` is less than `len(digits) - 1` and the digit at index `i` is greater than the digit at index `i + 1`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything specific under the given conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
