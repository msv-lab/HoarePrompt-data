You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: All characters from the `password` string have been processed, and `digits` and `letters` lists contain all the digits and lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string, respectively.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The `letters` list is sorted in ascending order, the `digits` list remains sorted in ascending order, `i` is equal to `len(digits)`, and for every `i` in the range of `len(digits)`, the conditions `i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]` are false, and `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the `digits` list. Additionally, the loop has checked that no two consecutive elements in the `digits` list are out of order (i.e., each element is not greater than the next one), and the last element of the `digits` list is not greater than any element in the `letters` list. If any of these conditions were violated during the loop's execution, the function would have returned `False` at the point of violation. Since the function did not return `False`, it implies that all checks passed successfully.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `password`, which is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function returns `True` only if the password meets specific conditions (which are not detailed here), otherwise it returns `False`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns False

Case_2: The program returns False

Case_3: The program returns False

Case_4: The program returns False

Case_5: The program returns False

Case_6: The program returns False

Case_7: The program returns True

Case_8: The program returns False


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
