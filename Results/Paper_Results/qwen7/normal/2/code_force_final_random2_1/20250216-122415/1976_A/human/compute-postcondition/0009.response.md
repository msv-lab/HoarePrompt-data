Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for char in password:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `char` and `password`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the `password` string.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `password` is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - `char` is the first character of `password`.
   - If the first character is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password`.
   - If the first character is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` is a list with one additional element `char`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `char` would have been set to the first character of `password`.
   - For the loop to continue, `password` must still contain characters. Therefore, `password` should now be the substring of the original `password` starting from the second character.
   - Depending on the value of `char`, either `digits` or `letters` will be updated. However, since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we don't need to explicitly state the contents of `digits` or `letters` unless they change.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `password` becomes the substring of the original `password` starting from the second character.
   - `char` becomes the first character of the new `password`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`password` is a string of length between 0 and 19 (inclusive), consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the first character of `password`**.
