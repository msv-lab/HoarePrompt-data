Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.
3. It then calls `func_1(password)` to check if the password meets the criteria for being a strong password.
4. In `func_1(password)`, the program separates the password into digits and letters, sorts them, and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement.
5. The conditions checked are:
   - No digit comes after a letter.
   - All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
6. After sorting and checking the conditions, the program constructs a new password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
7. It then compares this new password with the original password. If they match, the password is considered strong; otherwise, it is not.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
