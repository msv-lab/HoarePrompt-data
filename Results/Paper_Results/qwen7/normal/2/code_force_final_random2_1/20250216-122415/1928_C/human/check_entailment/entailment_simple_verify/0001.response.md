### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculating the Range for `k`:**
   - The key observation is that the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - To find valid `k`, we need to check the range where `k` can fit within the given constraints.
   - The expression `y = n + x` is used, and it is checked if `y` is even. If not, no valid `k` exists, and `0` is printed.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates possible values of `k` using the formula `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`.
   - It checks for divisors of these values and adds them to the list `M` if they meet certain conditions (`i >= x - 1`).

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case when `n >= 3 * x - 2` by adding additional valid `k` values from the second part of the range.

5. **Output:**
   - The final result is the count of unique valid `k` values found.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - When `y` is odd, the program correctly prints `0`.
   - When `y` is even, the program correctly calculates the range and checks for valid `k` values.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound. It correctly identifies potential `k` values by checking divisors.
   - The condition `i >= x - 1` ensures that only relevant divisors are considered.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the count of valid `k` values.

### Specific Points to Verify:

- **Divisor Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
  - The use of `math.sqrt(q)` to find potential divisors is efficient and correct.

- **Range Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the range for `k` by considering both parts of the settling pattern: `2k - 2` and `3k - 2`.

- **Set Conversion:**
  - Converting the list `L1` to a set ensures that only unique values are counted, which is important for the final output.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears to be logically correct and handles all specified cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
