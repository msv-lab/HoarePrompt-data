Output State: **`factor` is the first prime factor of `n`, `primes` is a list containing the prime factors of `n`, `nn` is 1, `factors` contains the complete prime factorization of `n` with the exponent of `nn` incremented by 1, the generator yields `factor`.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor` yields the value of `factor`, which is the first prime factor of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
