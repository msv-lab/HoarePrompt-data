Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit the "first-k-th" settling pattern.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and number \( x \) must satisfy certain conditions related to the divisors of \( q = n + x - 2 \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function calculates the divisors of \( q = (n + x - 2) \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It correctly handles the case where \( w = \sqrt{q} \) is an integer and includes \( w \) in the list if \( w \geq x - 1 \).
   - The loop iterates through potential divisors, adding them to the list if they meet the criteria.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the length of the resulting list.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases appropriately, such as when \( n \geq 3x - 2 \).

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
