Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**:
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`. However, according to the problem, the formula should be `y = n + 2 * (x - 1)` to account for the offset due to the settling pattern.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`. However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1` is unnecessary and incorrect. Also, the logic for adding divisors is not properly handled.

3. **Set Operations**:
   - Using `set` to remove duplicates is not necessary and can be simplified. The list `L1` should directly contain unique values without converting to a set.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` is very close to `3 * x - 2`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    y = n + 2 * (x - 1)
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    y //= 2
    ans = 0
    for k in range(x - 1, y + 1):
        if (y - k) % k == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version directly calculates the range of possible `k` values and checks if they satisfy the conditions, ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient.
