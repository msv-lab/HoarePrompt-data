Postcondition: `i` is 1, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n), and `w` must be greater than 1. If `q` is divisible by `i` and `i` is 1 with `q // i` being greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the values `i` and `q // i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.
