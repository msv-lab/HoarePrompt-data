Output State: **`factor` is yielded, `primes` is a list containing the first three prime factors of `n`, `nn` is 1, `factors` contains the complete prime factorization of `n` with the exponent of `nn` incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor` causes the value of `factor` to be yielded (returned) from the generator. The other variables (`primes`, `nn`, and `factors`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
