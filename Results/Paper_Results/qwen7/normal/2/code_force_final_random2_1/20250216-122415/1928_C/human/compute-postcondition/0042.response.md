Output State: `i` is `w`, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n), `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and `M` is a list containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

This output state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` reaching the value of `w`, which is the square root of `q`. The list `M` now contains all integers from the range `[x-1, w]` that divide `q` without leaving a remainder.
