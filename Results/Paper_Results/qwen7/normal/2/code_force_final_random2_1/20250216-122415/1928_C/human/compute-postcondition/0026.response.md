Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n), `w` must be greater than 2, and `M` is a list containing the values 2 and `q // i`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [q // i]` appends the value of `q // i` to the list `M`. Given the initial state, `M` initially contains the value 2. After executing the code, `M` will contain the value 2 and the new value `q // i`. The other variables (`i`, `q`, `x`, `w`) remain unchanged.
