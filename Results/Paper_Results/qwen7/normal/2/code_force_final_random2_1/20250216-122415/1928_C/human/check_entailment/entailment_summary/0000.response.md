Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining how many values of \( k \) satisfy the conditions given Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling process.

2. **Key Observations from the Execution Summary**:
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` calculates all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The main logic in the main program involves calculating `y = n + x` and checking if it is even.
   - If `y` is even, the program uses `func_1` to find possible values of \( k \).

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The main program correctly checks if `y` is even. If not, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
   - The calculation of `L1` involves finding divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and possibly adding more divisors based on `n` and `x`.
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Validation**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly identifies valid \( k \) values.
   - The main program correctly applies this logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case.

Given the detailed analysis, the code appears to be correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
