Output State: **The program returns the absolute value of the difference between the difference between the length of the string 'expression' and the total number of '+' characters in it, and the total number of '+' characters in it.**

To break it down:
- `length` is the length of the string `expression`.
- `count` is the total number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.
- `sub` is the difference between `length` and `count`, i.e., `sub = length - count`.
- The code returns `abs(sub - count)`, which simplifies to `abs((length - count) - count) = abs(length - 2 * count)`.

So, the program returns the absolute value of the difference between the length of the string `expression` and twice the total number of '+' characters in it.
