Output State: **`count` is 0, `expression` is a string of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is an integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. The initial state of `expression` and `length` remains unchanged. Therefore, `count` is set to 0, while `expression` and `length` retain their original values.
