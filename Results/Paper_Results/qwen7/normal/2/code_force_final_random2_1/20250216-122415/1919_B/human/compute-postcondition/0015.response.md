Output State: **`length` is the length of the string `expression`, `count` is the total number of '+' characters in the string `expression`, and `sub` is the difference between `length` and `count`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the number of characters in the string `expression` (stored in `length`) and subtracts the number of '+' characters found in the string (stored in `count`). The result of this subtraction is stored in the variable `sub`. The initial values of `length` and `count` remain unchanged, but `sub` is now defined as `length - count`.
