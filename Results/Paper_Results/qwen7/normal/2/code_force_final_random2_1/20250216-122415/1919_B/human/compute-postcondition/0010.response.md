Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `char` and `expression`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `expression`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is either 1 or 2.
   - `expression` is a non-empty string.
   - `char` is the second character in the string `expression`.
   - If `char` is '+', then `count` becomes 2. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `expression`.
   - After the previous iteration, `char` is the second character in `expression`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating through each character in `expression`, the next character to be processed will be the third character.
   - Therefore, `char` will be the third character in `expression`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `count` will remain the same unless the new `char` (which is the third character) is '+'.
   - `expression` will still be the same string, but now it will have one less character since the first two characters have already been processed.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `count` is either 1 or 2.
- `expression` is a non-empty string (since it still has characters left).
- `char` is the third character in the string `expression`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`count` is either 1 or 2, `expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the third character in the string `expression`**.
