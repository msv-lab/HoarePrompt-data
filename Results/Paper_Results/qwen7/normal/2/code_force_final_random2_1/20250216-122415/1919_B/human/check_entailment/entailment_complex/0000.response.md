Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array \(a\) derived from the string \(s\).
2. The penalty for a single array is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
3. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply calculates the absolute difference between the count of '+' and '-' in the string, which does not necessarily lead to the optimal split.

Let's analyze the given code:
- The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.
- It then calculates the number of '-' characters as `length - count`.
- Finally, it returns the absolute value of the difference between these two counts, i.e., `abs(length - 2 * count)`.

This approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty because:
- It does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
- For example, in the third test case (`--+++++++-`), the function would incorrectly return 0, but the optimal split would yield a penalty of 8.

To solve this problem correctly, one should use dynamic programming or a greedy approach to find the optimal splits. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Correctness: **False**
