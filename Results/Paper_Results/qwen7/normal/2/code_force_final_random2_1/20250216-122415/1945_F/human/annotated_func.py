#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, v is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and p is a permutation of n integers from 1 to n.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the decorating_function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `fillvalue` and returns a `decorating_function`. This indicates that the primary action of the function is to create and return a decorator function that will replace the original function call with `fillvalue` when used recursively.
