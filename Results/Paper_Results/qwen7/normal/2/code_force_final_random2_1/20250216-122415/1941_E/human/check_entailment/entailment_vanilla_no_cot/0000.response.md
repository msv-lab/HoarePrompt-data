Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges over the river. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It ensures that the first and last supports are installed at the river banks (cost 1).
   - For other supports, it calculates the minimum cost considering the constraint that the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It then reads the depths of the river cells for each row.
   - It uses `func_1` to compute the cost for each row.
   - It then iterates through the list of costs for the rows, calculating the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among these sets.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program correctly computes the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges over the river, ensuring the distance constraint between supports is met.
