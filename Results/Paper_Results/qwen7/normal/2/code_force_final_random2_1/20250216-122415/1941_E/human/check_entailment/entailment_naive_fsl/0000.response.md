Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly calculate the cost of installing supports for a single row according to the given rules. The function only adds 1 to the maximum value in the row that is within the distance `d` from the start, but it does not consider the minimum value within the valid range, which is necessary to ensure the distance between supports is no more than `d`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3 4 1 2
0 1 2 0
0 2 1 0
0 1 2 0
```

Expected output:
```
3
```

However, the program would output:
```
4
```

This is because the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the minimum value within the valid range, leading to an incorrect cost calculation. The correct approach would involve finding the minimum value within the valid range and adding 1 to it, ensuring the distance constraint is met.
