### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided Python program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to build \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at both ends (columns 1 and \( m \)).
   - The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than \( d \).
   - We need to minimize the total cost of installing these supports.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the cost of placing supports in a single row.
   - It ensures that the cost of placing a support in each cell is minimized while maintaining the required distance between supports.
   - The logic seems to correctly place supports starting from the leftmost end and propagating the minimum cost to the right.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the entire input and computes the total cost for building \( k \) bridges.
   - It reads the dimensions and the grid from input.
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to get the minimum cost for that row.
   - It then iterates over possible starting rows for the bridges and sums the costs for each set of \( k \) consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly handles the placement of supports with the given constraints.
   - It uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum cost for placing supports in the current row.
   - The logic seems sound and should work as intended.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function reads the input correctly and processes each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of \( k \) consecutive rows.
   - The logic to find the minimum total cost is correct and follows the problem statement.

### Key Points to Verify:

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly initializes the cost for the first and last columns.
  - The sliding window approach ensures that the minimum cost is propagated correctly.
  - The function returns the total cost for the row, which is used in the next step.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The function correctly reads the input dimensions and grid.
  - The function applies `func_1` to each row to get the minimum cost for that row.
  - The function iterates over possible starting rows for the bridges and sums the costs for each set of \( k \) consecutive rows.
  - The function finds the minimum total cost and prints it.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code and the annotated version, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for placing supports and calculating the total cost appears to be accurate.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
