Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements of the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single row of the river and calculates the cost of placing supports under certain constraints.
   - It increments the last element by 2, increments all other elements by 1, and then increments the first `d-2` elements by 1 again.
   - This function seems to correctly calculate the cost for a single row based on the given constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the entire grid and calculates the minimum cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
   - It reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It then reads the grid into a list of rows.
   - For each row, it calls `func_1` to get the cost of placing supports.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, let's verify if the functions work as intended:

- The `func_1` function correctly computes the cost for a single row according to the problem constraints.
- The `func_2` function correctly computes the cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum cost.

Based on the problem statement and the execution summaries, the given code appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
