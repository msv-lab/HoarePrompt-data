Output State: **`total_costs` is an empty list, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers converted from the input split by spaces, and `costs` is a list of `n` elements, each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `total_costs`. No changes are made to the `rows` or `costs` lists, so they retain their initial states. The `total_costs` list is now an empty list.
