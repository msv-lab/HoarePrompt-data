### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Input and Initial State:**
   - `row` is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of river cells in a row.
   - `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports.

2. **First Loop:**
   - For the first `d-1` elements, each element is incremented by 1.
   - This ensures that the first `d-1` elements are at least 1, which helps in the subsequent calculations.

3. **Second Loop:**
   - For the rest of the elements, each element is incremented by 1 plus the minimum value of the previous `d` elements.
   - This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

4. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns the last element of the modified `row`, which represents the total cost of installing supports in that row.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input and Initial State:**
   - `(n, m, k, d)` are integers such that `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100`, `3 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5`, and `1 ≤ d ≤ m`.
   - `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells.

2. **Processing Each Row:**
   - `costs` is a list of the total costs for each row, calculated using `func_1`.

3. **Calculating Total Costs:**
   - `total_costs` is a list of the sums of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - This is done to find the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

4. **Finding Minimum Total Cost:**
   - The minimum value in `total_costs` is printed, which gives the optimal solution.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly handles the placement of supports with the given constraints.
   - The logic for ensuring the distance between supports is no more than `d` is sound.
   - The function correctly calculates the total cost for each row.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function reads the input correctly and processes each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - The logic to find the minimum total cost is correct and follows the problem statement.

#### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for placing supports and calculating the total cost appears to be accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
