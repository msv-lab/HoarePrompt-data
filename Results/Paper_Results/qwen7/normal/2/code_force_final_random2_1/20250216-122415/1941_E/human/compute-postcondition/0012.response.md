Output State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, including the sum of the last `k` elements if they are available. `rows` remains a list of `n` lists, and `costs` remains a list of `n` elements. The variable `i` is set to `len(costs) - k`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `total_costs` will contain sums of all possible consecutive groups of `k` elements from the `costs` list, starting from the beginning and moving towards the end. If the `costs` list has fewer than `k` elements remaining at the end of the loop, those elements will be summed as well. The `rows` and `costs` lists remain unchanged, and `i` is set to the index just after the last group of `k` elements considered.
