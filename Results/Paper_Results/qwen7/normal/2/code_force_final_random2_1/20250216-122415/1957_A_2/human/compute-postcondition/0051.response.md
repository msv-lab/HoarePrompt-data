Output State: `shapes` is the total number of elements in `palka` that have a count of occurrences greater than or equal to 3 in `palka`. The variable `pl` contains all unique elements from `palka`, and the dictionary `d` keeps track of the count of each element in `palka`. After the loop has executed all its iterations, `shapes` will hold the final count of such elements.
