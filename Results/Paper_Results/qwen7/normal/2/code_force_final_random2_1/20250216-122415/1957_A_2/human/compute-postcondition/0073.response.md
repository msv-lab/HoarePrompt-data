Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the list `palka` and `i` is one of those elements.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is not in `d`, then `d` now contains the key-value pair `{i: 1}`. If `i` is already in `d`, then `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the first element of `palka`, removing `i` from `palka` will ensure that the loop continues if `palka` still contains elements.
   - After removing `i` from `palka`, the next element in `palka` becomes the new value of `i`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `palka` will be the remaining elements of the original `palka` list after removing the first element (which is `i`).
   - `i` will be the first element of the updated `palka` list.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `palka` list, and `d` is a dictionary. If the second element of the original `palka` is not in `d`, then `d` now contains the key-value pair `{second_element_of_palka: 1}`. If the second element of the original `palka` is already in `d`, then `d[second_element_of_palka]` is incremented by 1.**
