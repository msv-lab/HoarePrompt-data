Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `palka` list, and `d` is a dictionary with the key-value pair `{second_element_of_palka: 1}` if the second element of the original `palka` was not in `d`, otherwise `d[second_element_of_palka]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The initial state of `palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `palka` list. The dictionary `d` is initially empty or does not contain the second element of the original `palka` list. The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `i` is the second element of the original `palka` list, if this element was not already a key in `d`, it is added with a value of 1. If it was already a key, its value is incremented by 1. The first element of `palka` remains unchanged.
