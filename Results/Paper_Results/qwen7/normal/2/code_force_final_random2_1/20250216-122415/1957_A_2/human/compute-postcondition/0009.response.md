Output State: The dictionary `freq` will contain each unique stick length from the list `arr` as keys, and their respective counts as values.

In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop, the `freq` dictionary will have been populated with each distinct stick length found in the original list `arr`, and the value for each key will represent how many times that particular stick length appeared in the list.
