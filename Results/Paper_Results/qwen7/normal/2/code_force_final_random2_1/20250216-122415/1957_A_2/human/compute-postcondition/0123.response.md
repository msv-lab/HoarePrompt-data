Postcondition: `palka` has at least one element, `d` is a dictionary. If the key `i` is not initially in `palka`, then after executing the if statement, `i` will be added to `palka` and the value associated with key `i` in `d` will be incremented by 1. If the key `i` is already in `palka`, the function does nothing.
