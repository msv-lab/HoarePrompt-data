Output State: **`palka` has at least one element, `d` is a dictionary, and the key `i` is now in `palka`; the value associated with key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `palka`. Since `i` was not previously in `palka`, after executing this line, `i` will be added to `palka`. The dictionary `d` remains unchanged except that the value associated with key `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial postcondition.
