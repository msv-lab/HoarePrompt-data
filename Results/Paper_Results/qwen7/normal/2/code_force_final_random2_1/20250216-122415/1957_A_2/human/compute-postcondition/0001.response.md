Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `n` and the iterable `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. Each element in `arr` is an integer representing the length of a stick.

3. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: Since `n` is being used as an iterator over the elements of `arr`, the initial value of `n` should be the first element of `arr`.

4. **Determine the state of `arr`**: The list `arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Based on the above points, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element and that `n` is set to the first element of `arr`.

Given these considerations, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

**State: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `n` is the first element of `arr`**.
