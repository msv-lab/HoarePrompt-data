Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `j` and the list `pl`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more indices in `pl` that have not been processed.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `d[j]` is an integer.
   - `shapes` is either the same as the previous value or increased by 1 if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `j` is the next index in `pl`.

4. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be the next index in `pl`.
   - Since `j` is the next index, it means `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `d[j]` remains an integer because the loop body does not change this property.
   - `shapes` will be the same as the previous value unless `d[j+1]` (the new value of `d[j]` in the next iteration) is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 to become `j + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`d[j+1]` is an integer, `shapes` is either the same as the previous value or increased by 1 if `d[j+1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is the next index in `pl` (which is `j + 1`)**.
