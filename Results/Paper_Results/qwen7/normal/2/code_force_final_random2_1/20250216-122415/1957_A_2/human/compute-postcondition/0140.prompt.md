Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers created from the input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, the final value of `shapes` is determined by the number of elements in `palka` for which the condition `d[j] >= 3` is true.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `palka` has at least one element, `d` is a dictionary. If the key `i` is not initially in `palka`, then after executing the if statement, `i` will be added to `palka` and the value associated with key `i` in `d` will be incremented by 1. If the key `i` is already in `palka`, the function does nothing.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `palka` has at least one element, `d` is a dictionary, and if the key `i` is not in `d`, then `d[i]` remains unchanged. If the key `i` is in `d` and `d[i]` is not `None`, then `d[i]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `palka` has at least one element remaining, `d` is a dictionary. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `d[i]` is set to `1`. If `i` is already in `pl`, then `d[i]` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
