Output State: **`palka` has at least one element (second element), `i` is the second element in `palka`; `pl` now contains the element `i`; `d[i]` is either `1` or incremented by `1` depending on its previous value.**

Explanation: 
- The code appends the second element of `palka` to `pl`. So, `pl` now contains the element `i`.
- If `d[i]` was `None`, it is set to `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by `1`. The exact value of `d[i]` depends on its previous state, but it will be either `1` or incremented from its previous value.
