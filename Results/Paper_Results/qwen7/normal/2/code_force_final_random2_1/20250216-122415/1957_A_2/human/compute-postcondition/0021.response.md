Output State: **`palka` has at least one element (second element), `i` is the second element in `palka`, `d[i]` is 1, `pl` and `d` will be adjusted based on whether `i` is in `pl`.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The value of `i` is the second element in the list `palka`. The states of `palka` and `i` remain unchanged, and the adjustment of `pl` and `d` based on whether `i` is in `pl` is noted.
