Output State: **`freq[n]` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The line of code updates the frequency of `n` in the dictionary `freq`. If `n` already exists in `freq`, its value is incremented by 1. If `n` does not exist, it is added to `freq` with a value of 1. In both cases, the output state reflects that `freq[n]` has been updated accordingly.
