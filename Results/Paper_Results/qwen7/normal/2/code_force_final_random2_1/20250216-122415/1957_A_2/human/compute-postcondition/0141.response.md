Output State: **`shapes` is 0**.

The variable `shapes` is assigned the value 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `palka`, `d`, or `pl`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions where `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with counts of elements in `palka`, and `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka`. The only change is that `shapes` is now explicitly set to 0.
