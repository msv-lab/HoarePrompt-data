Reasoning:
The provided program aims to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks. The logic in the `func_1` function correctly calculates the frequency of each stick length and then determines how many complete polygons can be formed by dividing the frequency of each length by 4 (since each polygon requires 4 sides).

Here's a breakdown of the steps:
1. The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` as input.
2. It initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each stick length.
3. It iterates through the list `arr`, updating the frequency of each stick length in the dictionary.
4. Finally, it returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4, which gives the maximum number of complete polygons that can be formed.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function appears to be correct. However, there is a small issue with the problem statement and the expected output. According to the problem, no stick should be used in more than one polygon. This means that if a stick length is used to form a polygon, it should not be considered for forming another polygon. The current implementation does not account for this constraint.

Despite this, the provided solution correctly implements the logic for forming polygons based on the given frequencies, assuming that the same stick can be reused across different polygons, which is not aligned with the problem's constraints but is technically correct under that assumption.

Therefore, based on the provided execution summary and the logic implemented, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

This is because the program does not respect the constraint that no stick should be used in more than one polygon. If the constraint is strictly enforced, the solution would need to be adjusted to ensure that once a stick is used in a polygon, it is not considered again.
