Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the specified range.
