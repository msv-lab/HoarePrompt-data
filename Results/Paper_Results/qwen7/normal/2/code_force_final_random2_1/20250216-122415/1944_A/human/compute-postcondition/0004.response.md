Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). The values of `n` and `k` are set to the integers input by the user.
