To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The expression `n if n - k <= 1 else 1` is a conditional expression that evaluates to `n` if the condition `n - k <= 1` is true, otherwise it evaluates to `1`.
   - We need to consider two cases:
     - Case 1: If `n - k <= 1` is true, then the expression evaluates to `n`.
     - Case 2: If `n - k <= 1` is false, then the expression evaluates to `1`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The output depends on the values of `n` and `k`. If `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, the output will be `n`. Otherwise, the output will be `1`.

Given this analysis, the output will be either `n` or `1` depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **n if n - k <= 1 else 1**
