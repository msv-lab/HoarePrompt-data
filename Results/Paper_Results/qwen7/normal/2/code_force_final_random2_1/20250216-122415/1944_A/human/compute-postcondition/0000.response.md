Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as the input value is a non-negative integer.
   - Since `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), the input value must be within this range for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range for the loop to execute.
   - The initial state mentions that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This means that the input value must be within this range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value, which must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
