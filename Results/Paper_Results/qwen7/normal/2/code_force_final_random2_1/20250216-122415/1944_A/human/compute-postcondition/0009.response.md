Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are inputs provided through `input()`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and for each iteration, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer provided by the user. The final output will consist of the results of the `print` statements for each input pair `(n, k)` processed during the loop executions.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). For each input pair `(n, k)`, the value of `n` will be printed if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, `1` will be printed.
