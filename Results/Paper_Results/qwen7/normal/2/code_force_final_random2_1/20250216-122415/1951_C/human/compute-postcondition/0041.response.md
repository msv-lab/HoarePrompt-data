Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `k` is `k - n * s`, where `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
- `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`.

The `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer value of `c`.

To break it down further:
- `c` is the cumulative sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`.
- Since `i` is equal to `n` after the loop, the loop has already been executed with `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
- Therefore, `c` is the final value of the cumulative sum after the loop has completed.

Given this, the output will be the integer value of `c`.

Output: **int(c)**
