Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `k` is `k - n * s`, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to integer values from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list `l` from these integers. The values of `i`, `k`, `c`, `n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged from their previous values.
