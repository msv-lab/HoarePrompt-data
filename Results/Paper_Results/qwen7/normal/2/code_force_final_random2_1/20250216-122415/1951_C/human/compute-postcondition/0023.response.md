Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
