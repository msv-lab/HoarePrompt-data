Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9). a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l.sort()
    t = 0
    s = 0
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s = min(m, k)
        c += s * (l[i] + t)
        t += s
        k -= s
    print(int(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is increased by `s * (l[n-1] + t)`, `t` is increased by `s`, `k` is decreased by `s`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that all iterations from `0` to `n-1` have been completed. The variable `n` must have been greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute at least 3 times as observed. The variable `s` remains the minimum value between `m` and `k`. The variable `c` is updated by adding `s * (l[n-1] + t)` to its current value, where `n-1` is the last index of the list `l` that was processed. The variable `t` is increased by `s`, and `k` is decreased by `s` after each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `c` will be the sum of `s * (l[j] + t + cumulative increase from previous s)` for each iteration where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, `t` will be equal to the total cumulative sum of `s` from all iterations, and `k` will be the remaining value after subtracting `s` for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `k - (n-1) * min(m, k) - t`, `c` is `c + sum(min(m, k) * (l[i] + t) for i in range(n))`, `t` is `t + (n-1) * min(m, k)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
