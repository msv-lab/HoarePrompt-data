Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is increased by `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `k` is `k` minus `s`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 (assuming `i` starts from 0).
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `c` remains unchanged because it was updated outside the loop head.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `k` remains unchanged because the subtraction operation is also outside the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`c` is increased by `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `i` is less than `n`, `k` is `k` minus `s`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, since we only need to adjust the states of the loop head variables (`i` and `n`), the final answer is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.

So, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
