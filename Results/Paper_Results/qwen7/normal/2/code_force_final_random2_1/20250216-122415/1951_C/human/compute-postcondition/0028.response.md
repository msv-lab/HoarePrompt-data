Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.**

Explanation: The code `s = min(m, k)` assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to `s`. The variables `i` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` remains 0 and `n` must still be greater than 0. The value of `s` is now determined by the minimum of `m` and `k`.
