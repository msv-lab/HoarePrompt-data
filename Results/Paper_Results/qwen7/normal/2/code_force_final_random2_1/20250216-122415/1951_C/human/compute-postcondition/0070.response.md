Output State: **`i` is `n`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `k - 2 * min(m, k) - s`, `c` is `c + min(m, k) * (l[n] + t) + s * (l[i] + t)`, `t` is `t + 2 * min(m, k) + s**.

Explanation: The code `k -= s` subtracts the value of `s` from `k`. From the initial state, we know that `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`. Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - s`, which simplifies to `k - 2 * min(m, k)` since `s` is `min(m, k)`. The other variables (`i`, `c`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
