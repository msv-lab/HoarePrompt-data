Output State: **`i` is less than `n`; `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.**

Explanation: The code `s = min(m, k)` assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to `s`. The variables `i` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` remains less than `n`, and `s` takes on the smaller value between `m` and `k`.
