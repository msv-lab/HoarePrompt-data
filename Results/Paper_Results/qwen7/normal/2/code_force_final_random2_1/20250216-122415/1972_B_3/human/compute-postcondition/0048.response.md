Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it counts the number of "U" characters in `s`. If the count is odd, it appends "YES" to the results list; otherwise, it appends "NO". Finally, it prints each result in the list.**
