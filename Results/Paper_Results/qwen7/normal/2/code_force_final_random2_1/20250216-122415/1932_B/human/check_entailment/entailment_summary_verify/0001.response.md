### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Mismatch**: The provided program indeed does not match the problem description. The problem description talks about the Chaya tribe and the periodic occurrences of signs leading to an apocalypse. However, the code provided deals with a different problem involving paths and dynamic programming.

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1` is defined to handle a path with characters `@` and `*`, where `@` might indicate a valid path segment and `*` indicates an invalid one. It calculates the maximum valid path length using dynamic programming.
   - `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

3. **Expected Solution**:
   - The expected solution should calculate the year when the nth sign occurs based on the periodicity of each sign.
   - The logic involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities, as this will be the year when all signs occur sequentially.

4. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary for `func_2` correctly describes that it processes test cases and calls `func_1` to determine the LCM of the given periodicities. This aligns with the expected solution.
   - However, `func_1` is incorrectly designed for the problem. It should be designed to find the LCM of the periodicities rather than handling paths.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, `func_1` should be modified to compute the LCM of the periodicities.
   - The LCM can be computed iteratively using the formula: `lcm(a, b) = abs(a*b) // gcd(a, b)`.
   - Given the periodicities, the LCM of all periodicities would give the year when the nth sign occurs.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - While the function summary suggests that `func_2` is correctly designed to process the test cases and call `func_1`, the actual implementation of `func_1` is incorrect.
   - Therefore, the overall program is still incorrect because `func_1` does not perform the required computation.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The provided program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly compute the LCM of the periodicities, which is essential for determining the year when the nth sign occurs.
