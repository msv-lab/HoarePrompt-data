Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be designed to handle a different problem, possibly related to some kind of path or sequence analysis with special characters ('@' and '*'), rather than finding the year when all signs of the apocalypse occur sequentially based on their periodicities.

To solve the given problem correctly, you should implement a function that calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs. The LCM will give the year in which all signs will occur together, assuming they start occurring in the first year. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_apocalypse_year(periods):
    current_year = 1
    for period in periods:
        current_year = lcm(current_year, period)
    return current_year

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[1])
        periods = list(map(int, data[2:n+2]))
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
solve()
```

This solution correctly computes the year in which all signs will occur sequentially based on their periodicities.
