Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list using the variable `result`.
   - The key variables involved in the loop head are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more element in the `results` list.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `results` is a non-empty list.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `results` is non-empty, it means there is at least one element in the list.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element.
   - After processing one element from `results`, `results` will have one less element than before.

5. **Update the State:**
   - `results` must now be a non-empty list with one less element than before.
   - The `result` variable will hold the current element being processed.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`results` is a non-empty list with one less element than before, and `result` holds the current element being processed.**

Since we don't know the exact number of elements in the list or the specific value of `result`, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`results` is a non-empty list, and `result` holds the current element being processed.**
