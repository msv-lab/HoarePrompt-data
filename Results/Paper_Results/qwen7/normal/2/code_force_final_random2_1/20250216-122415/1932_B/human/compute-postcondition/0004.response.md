Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, each line consisting of `n` space-separated integers, and `index` is 1.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `data`, or `index`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
