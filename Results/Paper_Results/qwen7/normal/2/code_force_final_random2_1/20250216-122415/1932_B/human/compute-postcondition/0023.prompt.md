Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, each line consisting of `n` space-separated integers, and `index` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    path = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(path))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is now a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)`, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 4, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, `path` is the string from the fourth line of the `data` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is now a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)`, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus 1, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 6, `path` is the string from the 6th line of the `data` list, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, and `results` has been appended with the return value of `func_1(path)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous elements, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus 2, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 8, `path` is the string from the 6th line of the `data` list, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list converted to an integer, and `path` is now assigned to the value of `data[7]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
