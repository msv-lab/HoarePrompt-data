Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 4, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, `path` is the string from the fourth line of the `data` list.**

The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 3, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 4. The other variables (`results`, `t`, `data`, `n`, and `path`) remain unchanged.
