Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be greater than 3; `dp[i]` is negative infinity**

The code assigns `-float('inf')` to `dp[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 3, `dp[i]` is updated to negative infinity. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid.
