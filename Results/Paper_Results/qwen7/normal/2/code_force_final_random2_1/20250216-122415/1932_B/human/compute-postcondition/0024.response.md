Output State: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(path)` for all iterations, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus the total number of iterations (which is `t`), `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is `2 * t + 2`, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, and `path` is the string from the `2 * t + 3`rd line of the `data` list.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `results` will contain the output of `func_1(path)` for each iteration. The variable `t` will be reduced by the number of iterations, `index` will point to the position right after the last path value in the `data` list, `n` will still hold the integer from the second line, and `path` will hold the last path value from the `data` list.
