Output State: **`results` is now a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)`, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus 1, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 5, `path` is the string from the 6th line of the `data` list, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, `n` is converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `path`. Given that `index` is 5, `path` becomes the string from the 6th line of the `data` list. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
