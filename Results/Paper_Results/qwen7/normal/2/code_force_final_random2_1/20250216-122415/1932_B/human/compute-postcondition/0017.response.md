Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)`.
   - `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus 1.
   - `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines.
   - `index` is 6.
   - `path` is the string from the 6th line of the `data` list.
   - `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list.
   - `results` has been appended with the return value of `func_1(path)`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, and `t` is the integer value from the first line of `data` minus 1, the loop will continue as long as `t > 0`.
   - After each iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 because the loop runs `t` times initially and then decreases `t` by 1 after each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `results` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `t` is now `t - 1`.
- `data` remains unchanged.
- `index` remains unchanged.
- `path` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.

So, the new state is:

State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)`, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus 2, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 6, `path` is the string from the 6th line of the `data` list, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, and `results` has been appended with the return value of `func_1(path)`**.
