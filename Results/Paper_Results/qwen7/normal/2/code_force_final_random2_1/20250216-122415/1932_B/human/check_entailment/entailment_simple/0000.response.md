### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires determining the year when all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially, given their periodicities. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities, but the provided code does not seem to solve this problem correctly. Instead, it appears to be solving a different problem related to a sequence of valid and invalid signs.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is supposed to process a string `path` consisting of `@` and `*` characters, where `@` represents a valid sign and `*` represents an invalid sign. It calculates a dynamic programming array `dp` to determine the "validity" of each position in the string. However, the logic inside the function does not align with the problem statement. It seems to be calculating something related to the longest valid subsequence rather than the LCM of periodicities.
   
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads input from stdin, processes it using `func_1`, and prints the results. The input format suggests that it expects a series of test cases, each with a number of signs and their periodicities, followed by a string indicating the validity of each sign. However, since `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic, the output will not be meaningful for the given problem.

3. **Expected Solution**:
   - The correct approach would involve computing the LCM of the periodicities of the signs. The LCM will give the year when all signs will occur together for the first time.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that `func_1` does not implement the required logic for the problem, and `func_2` relies on `func_1`, the overall program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
