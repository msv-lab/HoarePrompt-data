Output State: **`results` is now a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)`, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 4, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, `path` is the string from the fourth line of the `data` list.**

Explanation: The code appends the return value of `func_1(path)` to the `results` list. The other variables (`t`, `data`, `index`, `n`, and `path`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
