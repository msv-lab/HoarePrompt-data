Output State: **`i` is 4; `dp[4]` is the maximum of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]` plus 1 if `path[4]` is not '*', otherwise `dp[4]` is negative infinity.**

Explanation: The code updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@', or negative infinity if `path[i]` is '*'. Given that `i` is 4, `dp[4]` is updated based on the values of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]`. The condition for `dp[4]` remains the same as the precondition, just updated with the new value. The value of `n` is not directly used in the calculation and remains greater than 4 as per the precondition.
