You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where '@' represents a valid sign and '*' represents an invalid sign. The length of path is at least 0 and at most 1000.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where '@' represents a valid sign and '*' represents an invalid sign; `n` is the length of the string `path`, and `n` is not equal to 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if (path[0] == '@') :
        dp[0] = 1
    else :
        if (path[0] == '*') :
            dp[0] = -float('inf')
        #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where '@' represents a valid sign and '*' represents an invalid sign; `n` is the length of the string `path`, and `n` is not equal to 0; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the first character of `path` is '*', the first element of `dp` is set to -inf.
    #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where '@' represents a valid sign and '*' represents an invalid sign; `n` is the length of the string `path`, and `n` is not equal to 0; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the first character of `path` is '@', the first element of `dp` is 1. If the first character of `path` is '*', the first element of `dp` is set to -inf.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where the first character is either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of the string `path`, with `n` being greater than 1; `dp` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is set to -inf if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise it is set to 1. The second element of `dp` is `dp[0] + 1` if the first character of `path` is '@', and `dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)` if the first character of `path` is '*'.
    #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where the first character is either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of the string `path`, with `n` being greater than 1; `dp` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is set to -inf if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise it is set to 1. If the first character of `path` is '@', the second element of `dp` is `dp[0] + 1`. If the first character of `path` is '*', the second element of `dp` is `dp[0] + 1` if the second character of `path` is '@', and `dp[0] + 0` if the second character of `path` is '*'.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. For every index `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `dp[j]` is set as follows:
    #- If `path[j]` is '*', then `dp[j]` is `-float('inf')`.
    #- If `path[j]` is '@', then `dp[j]` is the maximum of `dp[j-1]` and `dp[j-2]` plus 1.
    #- If `path[j]` is '*', and `path[j+1]` is '@', then `dp[j]` is the maximum of `dp[j-1]` and `dp[j-2]`.
    #
    #All other variables remain in their initial or updated states according to the loop's execution.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value among the elements in the dp list that are greater than negative infinity.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter path, which is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where '@' represents a valid sign and '*' represents an invalid sign. The length of path is at least 0 and at most 1000. The function returns 0 if no elements in the dp list are greater than negative infinity. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value among the elements in the dp list that are greater than negative infinity.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value among the elements in the dp list that are greater than negative infinity.
