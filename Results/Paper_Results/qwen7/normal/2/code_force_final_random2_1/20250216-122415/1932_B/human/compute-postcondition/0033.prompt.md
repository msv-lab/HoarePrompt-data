You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs. The following line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(path)` for all iterations, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus the total number of iterations (which is `t`), `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is `2 * t + 2`, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, and `path` is the string from the `2 * t + 3`rd line of the `data` list.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `results` will contain the output of `func_1(path)` for each iteration. The variable `t` will be reduced by the number of iterations, `index` will point to the position right after the last path value in the `data` list, `n` will still hold the integer from the second line, and `path` will hold the last path value from the `data` list.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(path)` for all iterations, `t` is reduced to 0, `data` remains a list of strings with the length equal to the initial `t` times 2 plus the number of lines in `path`, `index` points to the position right after the last path value in the `data` list, `n` still holds the integer from the second line, and `path` holds the last path value from the `data` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t sets of data. Each set consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. For each set, the function determines and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of the given periodicities a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
