Output State: **`results` is now a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)`, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus 1, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 4, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, `n` is converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` takes the value at the `index` position in the `data` list, which is the second line (since indexing starts at 0), and converts it to an integer. This integer value is assigned to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
