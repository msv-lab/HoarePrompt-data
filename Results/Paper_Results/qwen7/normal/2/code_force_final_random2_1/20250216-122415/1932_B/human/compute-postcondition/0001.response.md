Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `data` is a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, each line consists of `n` space-separated integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `data` now holds the split input for the first test case. Each subsequent test case would follow similarly, but since only the first line is processed here, `data` contains the split version of the first line of input.
