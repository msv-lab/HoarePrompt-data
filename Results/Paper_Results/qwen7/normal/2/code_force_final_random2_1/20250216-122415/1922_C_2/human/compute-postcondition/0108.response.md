Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list with at least 7 elements.
- `u` is `False`.
- `c` is the first return value from function `r()`, and `d` is the second return value from function `r()`.
- `c` is less than `d`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `b` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it must be another list.
- `c` and `d` are the return values from the function `r()`, and `c < d`.

Let's break down the expression inside the print statement:
- `(d - 1) * 2` calculates an index for the list `b`.
- `(c - 1) * 2` also calculates an index for the list `b`.

Since `c` and `d` are the return values from `r()` and `c < d`, both `c` and `d` are valid indices for the list `b` (assuming they are within the bounds of `b`).

The expression `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` subtracts the element at index `(c - 1) * 2` from the element at index `(d - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between these two elements.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]**
