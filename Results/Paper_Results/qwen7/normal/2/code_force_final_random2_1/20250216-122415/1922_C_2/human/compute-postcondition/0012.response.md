Output State: **`a` must have at least 5 elements, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are the next set of consecutive elements from `a`, `v` is equal to `y - x`.**

This means that the value of `v` is calculated as the difference between `y` and `x`, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
