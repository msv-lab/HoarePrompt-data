Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. These are derived from the `zip` function applied to the list `a`.

2. **Understand the initial state**:
   - `v` is `y - x`.
   - `t` is `t - 2`.
   - `a` is a list with at least 4 elements.
   - `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v]`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are enough elements in `a` to form tuples `(w, x, y, z)`.

4. **Analyze the current state**:
   - Since `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, the first tuple `(w, x, y, z)` was formed using the first four elements of `a`.
   - For the loop to continue, the next tuple `(w, x, y, z)` must be formed using the next four elements of `a`.

5. **Update the states for the next iteration**:
   - `w` will be the next element in `a` after the current `w`.
   - `x` will be the next element in `a` after the current `x`.
   - `y` will be the next element in `a` after the current `y`.
   - `z` will be the next element in `a` after the current `z`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `v` remains unchanged because it is defined based on the values of `y` and `x`, which will change but the relationship `v = y - x` will still hold.
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is defined based on the value of `t`, which does not change within the loop.
   - `a` will now have at least 4 elements minus 4 (since we are moving to the next 4 elements).
   - `b` will remain unchanged because it is defined based on the value of `b[-2] + v`, which does not change within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`v` is `y - x`, `t` is `t - 2`, `a` is a list with at least 0 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v]`**

However, since `a` must have at least 4 elements to form the tuple `(w, x, y, z)`, the correct state should reflect that `a` has at least 4 elements remaining:

State: **`v` is `y - x`, `t` is `t - 2`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v]`**
