Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `u` is `False`.
   - `c` is the first return value from the function `r()`.
   - `d` is the second return value from the function `r()`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The function `r()` returns two values, which are assigned to `c` and `d`.
   - The expression `c * 2 - 1` calculates an index for the list `b`.
   - Similarly, `d * 2 - 1` calculates another index for the list `b`.
   - The difference between the elements at these indices is then printed.

4. **Determine the Values**:
   - Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not specified, we need to consider their possible values. However, the problem does not specify any constraints on `c` and `d` other than they are the return values of `r()`.
   - Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` without knowing the contents of `b`.

Given this analysis, the precise values of `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` cannot be determined from the initial state alone. However, we know that these are elements from the list `b` indexed by `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1`.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]** (where `c` and `d` are the return values of the function `r()`)
