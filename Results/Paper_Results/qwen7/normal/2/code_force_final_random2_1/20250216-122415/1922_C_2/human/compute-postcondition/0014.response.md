Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])`. The variables involved in the loop head are `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are at least 4 consecutive elements in `a` to unpack into `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` must have at least 5 elements.
   - `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are the next set of consecutive elements from `a`.
   - `v` is equal to `y - x`.
   - `b` is updated to include `b[-2] + v`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over consecutive elements, each iteration consumes one element from the beginning of the sequence defined by `a[1:]`, `a[2:]`, and `a[3:]`.
   - Therefore, after the previous iteration, `a` must have at least 6 elements to ensure that there are still 4 consecutive elements left for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` must now have at least 6 elements.
   - `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be the next set of consecutive elements from the updated `a`.
   - `v` will be updated to `y - x` based on the new values of `y` and `x`.
   - `b` will be updated to include `b[-2] + v` based on the new value of `v`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` must have at least 6 elements, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are the next set of consecutive elements from `a`, `v` is equal to `y - x`, `b` is updated to include `b[-2] + v**.
