Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `v` is `y - x`
- `t` is `t - 2`
- `a` is a list with at least 4 elements
- `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v]`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the following variables:
   - `w`
   - `x`
   - `y`
   - `z`

2. **Determine the Source of These Variables**:
   - `w` comes from `a[i]`
   - `x` comes from `a[i+1]`
   - `y` comes from `a[i+2]`
   - `z` comes from `a[i+3]`

3. **Update `a` for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop advances by 4 elements each time, the next set of values for `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be taken from the next 4 consecutive elements in the list `a`.

4. **Ensure `a` Has at Least 4 Elements**:
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must still have at least 4 elements. If it doesn't, the loop will terminate.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `v` and `t` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.
   - `a` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to continue.
   - `b` is not directly involved in the loop head, so its state remains unchanged.

### Final State for the Next Iteration
- `v` remains `y - x`
- `t` remains `t - 2`
- `a` must have at least 5 elements (since the next set of values will be taken from `a[4]`).
- `b` remains `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v]`

### Final Answer
State: **`v` is `y - x`, `t` is `t - 2`, `a` must have at least 5 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v]`**
