Output State: **`v` is `y - x`, `t` is `t - 2`, `a` must have at least 5 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v]`**

Explanation: The code `v = y - x` does not change the value of `v` since it is already defined as `y - x` in the initial state. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
