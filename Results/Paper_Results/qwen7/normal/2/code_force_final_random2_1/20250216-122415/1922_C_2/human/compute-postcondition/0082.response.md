Postcondition: **`v` is `y - x`, `t` is `t - 4`, `a` has at least 5 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v, b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v), b[-1] + v + (v > z - y) * (b[-1] + v), b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-1] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v))], `c` is the return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`, `u` is false, `c` and `d` are the return values of function `r()`**.

This means that regardless of whether the condition `c < d` is true or false, the values of `v`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `u` remain unchanged from their preconditions. The function `r()` is called twice, and its return values are stored in `c` and `d`. The variable `u` remains false.
