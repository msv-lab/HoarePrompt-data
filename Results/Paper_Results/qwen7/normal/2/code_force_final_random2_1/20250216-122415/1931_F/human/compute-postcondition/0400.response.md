Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `n-2`, meaning it increments `i` by 1 each iteration until `i` is less than `n-1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p1` is either 0 or 1
   - `p2` is either 0 or 1
   - `i` is 1 (indicating the current iteration)
   - `idx1` is either 0 or 1
   - `idx2` is either 0 or 1
   - If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged.
   - If the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` is true, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to 1.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next iteration will increment `i` to 2.
   - We need to check the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` with `i = 2`.
   - If the condition is true, then `idx1` and `idx2` will both be set to 1.
   - If the condition is false, then `idx1` and `idx2` will remain unchanged.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in the next iteration, the new value of `i` will be 2. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and the conditions involving `idx1` and `idx2`.

### Step-by-step adjustment:
- `i` will be incremented to 2.
- `idx1` and `idx2` will remain unchanged unless the condition `l1[2 + p1] == a2 and l2[2 + p2] == a1` is true.

### Final state:
- `i` will be 2.
- `idx1` and `idx2` will remain either 0 or 1 depending on the condition.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `idx1` is either 0 or 1, `idx2` is either 0 or 1**
