Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `a3` and `l3` from the tuple `(a3, l3)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more tuples in the list `val`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` is 3.
   - `val` is a list containing exactly 3 tuples, each tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).

4. **Analyze the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, the loop does not change the state of `m` or `val` directly. It checks if `l3` is not equal to a list created by iterating through `l` and including only elements that are not equal to `a3`. If this condition holds, the state remains unchanged.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop does not modify `m` or `val` directly, and the condition for continuing the loop is based on the remaining tuples in `val`, the number of tuples in `val` will decrease by one after each iteration.
   - After the previous iteration, `val` had 3 tuples. For the next iteration, `val` must have 2 tuples left.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `val` now contains 2 tuples.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` is 3, `val` is a list containing exactly 2 tuples, each tuple is (`a3`, `l3`)**
