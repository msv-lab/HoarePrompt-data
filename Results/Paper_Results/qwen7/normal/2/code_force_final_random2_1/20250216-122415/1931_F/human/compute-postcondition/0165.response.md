Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `val` will hold the history of all pairs (`a3`, `l3`) from each iteration, and the final output will be 'yes' if the condition is met for all iterations, otherwise 'no'.**

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them by whitespace, converting them to integers and assigning them to `n` and `m` respectively. The variable `val` remains unchanged and still holds the history of all pairs (`a3`, `l3`) from each iteration. The final output condition for `val` also remains the same.
