Output State: **`idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `val` is an empty list, and the value of `a2` has been inserted into `val` at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` does not affect any of the variables listed in the initial state. It only assigns `l2` to `l`, but since no variable named `l` or `l2` was mentioned in the initial state, this assignment does not change any existing variables. Therefore, all the variables remain in their initial states.
