Output State: **p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n-2, idx1 is n-2, the current value of idx2 is n-2, and val is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `n - 2` to `idx2`. Since `n - 2` is already the current value of `idx2`, no change occurs. All other variables remain unchanged.
