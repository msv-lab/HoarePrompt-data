Output State: **`a2` is the first element of the input split into an integer, `l2` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split into integers, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `val` will hold the history of all pairs (`a3`, `l3`) from each iteration, `a1` is the first element of the input split into integers, `l1` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split into integers, `l11` is a list containing elements of `l1` excluding `a2`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` which contains all elements of `l1` except for `a2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
