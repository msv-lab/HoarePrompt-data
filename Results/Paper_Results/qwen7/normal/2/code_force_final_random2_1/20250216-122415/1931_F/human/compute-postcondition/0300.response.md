Postcondition: `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `val` is a list containing either one tuple `(a3, l3)` where `l3` is either `l1` with `a1` inserted at index `n-2` or `l2` with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` (where `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`), and `m` is `n-1` minus 1, or `val` is an empty list if `idx1 <= idx2`.

This postcondition states that after executing the if-else block, `idx1` remains either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` remains `n-2`, `p1` and `p2` remain 1, `i` remains `n-1`, `n` remains greater than 1, and `val` contains either the tuple `(a3, l3)` as described or is an empty list if the condition `idx1 < idx2` is false.
