Output State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 1, `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to both `idx1` and `idx2`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition about breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains the same.
