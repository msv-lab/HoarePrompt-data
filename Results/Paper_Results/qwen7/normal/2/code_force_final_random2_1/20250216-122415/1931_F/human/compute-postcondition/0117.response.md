Output: **yes**

Explanation: The print statement simply outputs the string "yes". According to the initial state, none of the variables or objects involved in the print statement are relevant to its content. The values of `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` do not affect the output of the print statement, which is solely the string "yes".
