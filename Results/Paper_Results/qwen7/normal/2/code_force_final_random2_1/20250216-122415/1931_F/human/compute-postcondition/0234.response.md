Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1 to become `k+2`, `idx1` is equal to `i`, `idx2` is either equal to `i` or remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `n` remains greater than 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the condition is met and no further changes occur.
