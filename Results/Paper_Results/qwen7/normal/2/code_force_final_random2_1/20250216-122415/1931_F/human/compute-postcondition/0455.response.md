Output State: **`m` must be at least 3, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a3` while the rest are collected into a list `l3`. The precondition that `m` must be at least 3 remains unchanged.
