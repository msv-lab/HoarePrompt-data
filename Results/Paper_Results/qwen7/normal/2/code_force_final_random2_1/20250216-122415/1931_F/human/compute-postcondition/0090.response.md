Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the total number of integers from input, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is `m + (n - 1)`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input excluding `a1`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either 2, 1, or -1, `idx2` is either 2, 1, or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n - 1`. The variable `m` increments by 1 for each iteration of the loop, so it will be `m + (n - 1)` after `n - 1` iterations. The values of `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` depend on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, `idx1` and `idx2` are updated based on whether certain elements in `l1` and `l2` match `a2` and `a1`, respectively. If such matches are found, `idx1` and `idx2` are set to specific indices; otherwise, they may remain -1, 1, or 2 depending on the loop's execution path.
