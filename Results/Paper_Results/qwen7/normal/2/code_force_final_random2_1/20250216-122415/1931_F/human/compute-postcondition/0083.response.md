Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is 3 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx1` is 2, 1, or -1 and `p1` is 1 or 0.
