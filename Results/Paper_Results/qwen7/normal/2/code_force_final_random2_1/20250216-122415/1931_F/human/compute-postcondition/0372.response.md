Output State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, `idx2` is 0, the elements at index `i + p1` in list `l1` are not equal to the elements at index `i + p2` in list `l2`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The code `idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `idx2`. All other variables (`p1`, `p2`, and the conditions involving `l1` and `l2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
