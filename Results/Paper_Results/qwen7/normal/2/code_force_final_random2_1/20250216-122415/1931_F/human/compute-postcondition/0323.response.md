Postcondition: **`val` contains `m - 2` tuples, `a3` and `l3` are the values from the next tuple in `val`, and either `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension excluding `a3` from `l`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no else part and the values remain as they were checked.**
