Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split, `val` is a list containing a tuple of (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. The values of `a3` and `l3` remain unchanged, but now `val` contains the tuple formed by `a3` and `l3`.
