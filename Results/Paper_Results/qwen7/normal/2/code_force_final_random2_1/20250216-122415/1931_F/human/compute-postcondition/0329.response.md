Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `val` will contain `m - 2` tuples, each representing the values of `a3` and `l3` from each iteration of the loop. The variable `m` will be set to 2, indicating that the loop ran `m - 2` times.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the list `val` will hold a total of `m - 2` tuples, where each tuple consists of the values of `a3` and `l3` from each respective iteration. The variable `m` will be reduced to 2, signifying that the loop executed `m - 2` times. The loop checks if `l3` (from the current tuple in `val`) is not equal to a list comprehension that excludes `a3` from the original list `l`. If this condition is met, the loop breaks; otherwise, it continues to the next iteration. Once all iterations are complete, the final state of `val` and `m` reflects the outcomes of these checks.
