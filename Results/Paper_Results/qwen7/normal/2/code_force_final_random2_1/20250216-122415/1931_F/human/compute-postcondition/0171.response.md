Output State: **`a2` is the first element of the input split into an integer, `l2` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split into integers, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `val` will hold the history of all pairs (`a3`, `l3`) from each iteration, `a1` is the first element of the input split into integers, and `l1` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string into a tuple where `a2` is the first element and `l2` is a list of the remaining elements. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state and were not affected by the code. The variables `a1` and `l1` also remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state and were not affected by the code. The variable `val` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
