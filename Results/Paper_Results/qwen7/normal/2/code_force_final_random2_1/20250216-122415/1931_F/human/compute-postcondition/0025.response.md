Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is `m-2 + 3 = m`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, and `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`. The current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22`, and the loop continues indefinitely because the `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop body and starts the next iteration.**
