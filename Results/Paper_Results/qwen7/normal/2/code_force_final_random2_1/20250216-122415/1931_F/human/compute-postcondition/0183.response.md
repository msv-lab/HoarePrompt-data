Output State: **`m` is at least 5, and the loop will have executed `m - 5` times. Each input taken during the loop iterations is not stored in any variable, and the other variables retain their initial or previous values.**

In this case, the `continue` statement is used inside a loop, which skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one. Since no specific changes are made to any variables within the loop, and the loop's behavior is already described by the initial state and the condition `m - 2` iterations, the `continue` statement does not alter the number of iterations or the values of the variables. Therefore, the loop continues to execute until it has completed `m - 5` iterations, and the value of `m` remains at least 5.
