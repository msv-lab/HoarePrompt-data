Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `n`, `l1[i + p1]`, and `l2[i + p2]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
