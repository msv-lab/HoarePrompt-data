Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `idx1` and `idx2` are integers.
- `p1` and `p2` are non-negative integers.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, then:
  - `idx1` and `idx2` are set to either `i` and `-1`, or `-1` and `i`.
  - `p1` and `p2` are set to either `1` and `0`, or `0` and `1`.
  - If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is in the loop head.
   - The loop condition depends on `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop is `for i in range(n - 1)`, the loop will iterate from `0` to `n-2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `0 <= k < n-2`).

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `k+1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

### New State:
- `idx1` and `idx2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
- `p1` and `p2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains greater than 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` and `p2` are non-negative integers, `n` is greater than 1.**

This is the final answer based on the given conditions and the loop structure.
