Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` and `p2` are non-negative integers, `n` is greater than 1. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, then:

- `idx1` and `idx2` are set to either `i` and `-1`, or `-1` and `i`.
- `p1` and `p2` are set to either `1` and `0`, or `0` and `1`.
- If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1 to become `k+2`, `idx1` is equal to `i`, `idx2` is either equal to `i` or remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `n` remains greater than 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the condition is met and no further changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `k+3`, `idx1` is either `i` or `k+3`, `idx2` is either `k+3` or `i`, `p1` is either 1 or remains the same, `p2` is either 1 or remains the same, and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
