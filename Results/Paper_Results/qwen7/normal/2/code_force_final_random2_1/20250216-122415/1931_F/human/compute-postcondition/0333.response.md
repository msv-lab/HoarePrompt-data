Output: **yes**

Explanation:
- The initial state indicates that `val` contains a single tuple.
- `m` is explicitly given as 1.
- `t` must be at least 1, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer, but it is not used in the print statement.
- The print statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'yes'` without referencing any variables whose values need to be computed, the output is simply `'yes'`.
