Output State: **p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n-2, idx1 is n-2, idx2 is either 0, 1, ..., n-3 or -1, and val is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `idx1 = n - 2` updates the value of `idx1` to `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `idx1` is `n - 2`, while `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx2`, and `val` retain their original values.
