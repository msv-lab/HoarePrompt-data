Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head uses `_` as the loop variable, but this is just a placeholder and does not affect the state. The key information comes from the range function, which depends on the value of `m`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the condition `m - 2` must be non-negative. This means `m` must be at least 2.

3. **List the relevant states to be adjusted**: Based on the given states and the loop condition, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 2. The other states (`a2`, `l2`, `n`, `m`, `val`, `a1`, `l1`, `l11`, `l22`) do not directly affect the loop execution condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `m` being greater than or equal to 2.

**State:**
**`m` must be greater than or equal to 2**
