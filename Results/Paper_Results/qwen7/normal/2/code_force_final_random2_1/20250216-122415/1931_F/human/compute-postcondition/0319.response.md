Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `a3` and `l3`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as the current value of `l3` is not equal to a list obtained by iterating over `l` and excluding all elements that are equal to `a3`. If this condition is met, the loop breaks.

3. **Determine the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, and for each tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, the condition mentioned above must hold true.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `val` must still contain `m - 2` tuples because the loop hasn't yet broken.
   - `a3` and `l3` will be the values from the next tuple in `val`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can continue to the next iteration without breaking based on the given condition.

**Step-by-Step Adjustment**:
- Since the loop hasn't broken, `val` still contains `m - 2` tuples.
- For the next iteration, `a3` and `l3` will be the values from the next tuple in `val`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next tuple in `val`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`val` contains `m - 2` tuples, `a3` and `l3` are the values from the next tuple in `val`**
