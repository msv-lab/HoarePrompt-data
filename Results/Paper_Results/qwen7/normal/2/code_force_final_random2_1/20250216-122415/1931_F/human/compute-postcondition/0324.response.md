Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is defined by the tuple `(a3, l3)` being iterated over from the iterable `val`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are tuples left in `val`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `val` contains `m - 2` tuples.
   - `a3` and `l3` are the values from the next tuple in `val`.
   - Either `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension excluding `a3` from `l`, in which case we break out of the loop, or the values remain as they were checked.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are tuples left in `val`, we need to check if there is another tuple in `val`.
   - If there is another tuple, `val` will now contain `m - 3` tuples (since one tuple was consumed in the previous iteration).
   - `a3` and `l3` will be updated to the values from the next tuple in `val`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `val` should now contain `m - 3` tuples.
   - `a3` and `l3` should be the values from the next tuple in `val`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`val` contains `m - 3` tuples, `a3` and `l3` are the values from the next tuple in `val`, and either `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension excluding `a3` from `l`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or if there is no else part and the values remain as they were checked.**
