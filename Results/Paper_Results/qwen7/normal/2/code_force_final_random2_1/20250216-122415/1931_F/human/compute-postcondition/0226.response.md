Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 to become `k+2`, `idx1` and `idx2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `n` remains greater than 1, and `idx2` is now equal to `i`.**

This means that `idx2` has been updated to the current value of `i`, which is `k+2` incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous states.
