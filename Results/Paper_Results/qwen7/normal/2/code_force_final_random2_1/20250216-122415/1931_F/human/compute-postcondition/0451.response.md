Output State: **`p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-3`, `idx1` is `n-2`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**.

The code `m -= 1` decrements the value of `m` by 1. Since `m` was not explicitly defined before the code snippet and its initial value is not given, we assume it refers to `i`, `idx1`, or `idx2`, which all have the same value of `n-2`. After decrementing, `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2` become `n-3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
