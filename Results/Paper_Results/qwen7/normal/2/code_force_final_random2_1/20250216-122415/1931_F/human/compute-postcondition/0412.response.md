Output State: **`p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `idx1` is either 0, 1, or 2, `idx2` is either 0, 1, or 2, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, or `idx2`. It only indicates that the program exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values, and the fact that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement is noted.
