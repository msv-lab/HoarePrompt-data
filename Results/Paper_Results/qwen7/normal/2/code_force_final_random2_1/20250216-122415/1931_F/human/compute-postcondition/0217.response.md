Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` and `p2` are non-negative integers, `n` is greater than 1. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, then either `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `-1`, or `idx1` is set to `-1` and `idx2` is set to `i`; `p1` is set to `1` and `p2` is set to `0`, or `p1` is set to `0` and `p2` is set to `1`. Additionally, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
