Output State: **`val` contains 1 tuple, `m` is at least 5, `t` must be at least 1, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers from the input (excluding any instances of `a2`), `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `idx1` and `idx2` to -1. This assignment does not affect any of the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `val`, `m`, `t`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, and `l22` remain unchanged from their initial states.
