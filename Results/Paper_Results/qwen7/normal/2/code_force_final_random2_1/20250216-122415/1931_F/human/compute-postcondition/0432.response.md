Output State: **p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n-2, idx1 is n-2, idx2 is n-2, val is an empty list, a1 is inserted into the list at index idx2.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value `a1` into the list `l1` at the index `idx2`. Since `idx2` is equal to `n-2`, `a1` is inserted into the list at position `n-2`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, and `val` remain unchanged.
