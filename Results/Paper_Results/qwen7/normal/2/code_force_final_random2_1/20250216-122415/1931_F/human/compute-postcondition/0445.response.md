Postcondition: `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is `n-2`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input, and the program continues the loop or iteration if `m` equals 2, otherwise, no change to the variables. The index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.
