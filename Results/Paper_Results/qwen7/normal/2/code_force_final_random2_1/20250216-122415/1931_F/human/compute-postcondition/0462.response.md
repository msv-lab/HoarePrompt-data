Output State: **`m` must be at least 3, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple: (`a3`, `l3`). After appending, `val` will contain two identical tuples: (`a3`, `l3`). All other variables remain unchanged.
