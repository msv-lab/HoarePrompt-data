Output State: **`i` is `k+3`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is either `k+3` or remains the same, `p1` and `p2` remain the same.**

Explanation: The code snippet `idx1 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is `k+3`) to `idx1`. The other variables (`idx2`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
