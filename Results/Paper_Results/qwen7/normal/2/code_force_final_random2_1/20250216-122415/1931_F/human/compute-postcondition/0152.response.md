Postcondition: `val` must contain at least one tuple, where `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` except for `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to such a list, then no specific action is taken as there is no else part provided.
