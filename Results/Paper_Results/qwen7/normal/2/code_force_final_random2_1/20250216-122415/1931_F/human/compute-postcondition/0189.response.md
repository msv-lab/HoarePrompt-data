Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional context is provided, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial values.
