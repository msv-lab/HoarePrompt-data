Postcondition: `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` is true, then `p1` is set to 0 and `idx1` is set to 0. Otherwise, `p1` is set to 1 and `idx1` is set to 0.
