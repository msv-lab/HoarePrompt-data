Output State: **`a2` is the first element of the input split into an integer, `l2` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split into integers excluding the element equal to `a1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `val` will hold the history of all pairs (`a3`, `l3`) from each iteration, `a1` is the first element of the input split into integers, `l1` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split into integers, `l11` is a list containing elements of `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding the element equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l22` which contains all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
