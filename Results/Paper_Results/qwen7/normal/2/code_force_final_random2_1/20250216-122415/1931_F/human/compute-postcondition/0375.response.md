Postcondition: `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, `idx1` is 0, the elements at index `i + p1` in list `l1` are equal to `a2`, the elements at index `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal to `a1`, or `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, `i` is 0, `idx2` is 0, the elements at index `i + p1` in list `l1` are not equal to the elements at index `i + p2` in list `l2`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.
