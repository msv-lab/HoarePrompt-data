Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` must contain at least one tuple.
- `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`.
- `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('no')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'`. Since there is no reference to `a3` or `l3` in this statement, they do not affect the output.

Output: **no**
