Output State: **`val` contains 1 tuple, `m` is 1, `t` must be at least 1, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers from the input, `a2` is an integer from the input, and `l2` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a2` and the rest to `l2`. The initial values of `val`, `m`, `t`, `a1`, and `l1` remain unchanged.
