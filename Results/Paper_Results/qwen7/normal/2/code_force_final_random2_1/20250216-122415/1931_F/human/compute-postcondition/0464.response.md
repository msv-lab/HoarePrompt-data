Output State: `m` must be exactly 3, `a3` is the first integer from each of the three inputs, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input, `val` is a list containing three tuples: each tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (3 times in this case), `m` will be exactly 3 because the loop runs `m-2` times. Each iteration of the loop appends a tuple consisting of `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. Since the loop runs 3 times, `val` will contain 3 such tuples.
