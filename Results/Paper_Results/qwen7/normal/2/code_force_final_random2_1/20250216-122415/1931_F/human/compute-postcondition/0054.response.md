Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 1 or -1, `idx2` is 1 or -1, `p1` is 1 or 0, `p2` is 1 or 0, and if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
