Postcondition: `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `idx1` is either 0, 1, or 2, `idx2` is either 0, 1, or 2, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[3] == a2` and `l2[3] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to 2. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` retain their original values of either 0 or 1.
