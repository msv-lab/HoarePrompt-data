Output State: **`p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is `n-2`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input, and the current value of `l3.index(a1)` is less than the current value of `l3.index(a2)`; `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.**

This means that the list `l1` now has the value `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`, while all other variables retain their original values and conditions.
