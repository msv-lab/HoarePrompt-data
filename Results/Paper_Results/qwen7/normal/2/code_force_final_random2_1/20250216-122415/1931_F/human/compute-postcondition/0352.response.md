State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `i < n - 1` must be true.
3. At the start of the loop, `i` is initialized to 0.
4. Therefore, `n - 1` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
5. This means `n` must be greater than 1.

Hence, the initial state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
