Postcondition: `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. Since the if condition `m == 2` is not specified to change any of these variables, and there is no else part to alter the state, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
