Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 to become `k+2`, `idx1` is now `i`, `idx2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` is now 1, `p2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `n` remains greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l1[i + p1] == a2`. Otherwise, `p2` is 1, `i` is `k+2`, `idx1` and `idx2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `n` remains greater than 1.**
