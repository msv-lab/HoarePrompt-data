Output State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, the elements at index `i + p1` in list `l1` are equal to `a2`, the elements at index `i + p2` in list `l2` are equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Since `i` was initially 0, both `idx1` and `idx2` are now also 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
