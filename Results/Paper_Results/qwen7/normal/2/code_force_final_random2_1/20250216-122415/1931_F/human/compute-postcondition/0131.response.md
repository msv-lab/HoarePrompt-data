Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l3` is a list containing the third integer from input and the rest of the integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**.

Explanation: The value of `m` is decremented by 1, so `m` is now `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
