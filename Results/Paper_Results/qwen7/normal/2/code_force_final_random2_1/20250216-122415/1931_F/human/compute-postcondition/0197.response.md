Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial values.
