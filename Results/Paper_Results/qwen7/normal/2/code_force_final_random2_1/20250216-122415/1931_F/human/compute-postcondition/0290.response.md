Postcondition: `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `val` is an empty list, and the input is split into `a3` and `l3` where `a3` is the first element and `l3` is a list of the remaining elements. Additionally, `l3.index(a1)` is greater than or equal to `l3.index(a2)`.
