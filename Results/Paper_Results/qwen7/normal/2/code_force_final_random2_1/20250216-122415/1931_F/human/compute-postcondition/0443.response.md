Output State: **`p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is `n-2`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input, and the current value of `l3.index(a1)` is less than the current value of `l3.index(a2)`; `l` is now equal to `l1`.**

The code `l = l1` assigns the value of `l1` to `l`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)` is still valid, and `l1` now holds the value of `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.
