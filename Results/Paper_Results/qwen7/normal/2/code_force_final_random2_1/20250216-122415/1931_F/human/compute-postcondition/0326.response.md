Output State: **`val` contains `m - 3` tuples, `a3` and `l3` are the values from the next tuple in `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of `val`, `a3`, or `l3`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values, and the only change is that we break out of the loop or if statement.
