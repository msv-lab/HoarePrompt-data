Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` must be greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22`, an additional input is taken.**

Explanation: The code `input()` reads an additional input from the user. This input could be of any type (string, integer, etc.), but since no specific type is mentioned, we assume it is a general input. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, and the condition regarding `l11` remain unchanged.
