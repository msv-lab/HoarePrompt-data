Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either 2, 1, or -1, `idx2` is either 2, 1, or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, then depending on the values of `l1[i + p1]` and `a2`, `idx1` is set to 3 and `idx2` is set to 2, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged and `idx2` is set to 3.
