Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head uses `_` as the loop variable and `m - 2` as the range. The loop variable `_` is typically an underscore, indicating that the value of `_` itself is not used within the loop body.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `m - 2` is a positive integer. This means `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Adjust the relevant states**: We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, and `l11`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

4. **Formulate the final state**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` to ensure it is greater than 2.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` must be greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22`**
