Output State: **`idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, `i` is 1, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` while `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The code sets both `idx1` and `idx2` to the value of `i`, which is initially 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
