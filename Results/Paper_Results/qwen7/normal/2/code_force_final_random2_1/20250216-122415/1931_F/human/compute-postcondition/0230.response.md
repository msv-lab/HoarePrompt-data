Output State: **We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `i` is `k+2`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` is 1, `p2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, and `n` remains greater than 1.**

This output state reflects that the `break` statement causes us to exit the loop or if statement. The values of `i`, `idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n` are updated according to the given conditions, while `idx2` retains its value from the end of the previous iteration.
