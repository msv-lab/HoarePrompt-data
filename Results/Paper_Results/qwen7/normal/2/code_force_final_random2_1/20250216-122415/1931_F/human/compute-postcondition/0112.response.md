Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `m` is `m + 9`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l1` is a list with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `val` is an empty list, and `l` is now equal to `l1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns the value of `l1` to `l`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `l` is updated to be equal to `l1`, while all other variables retain their initial conditions.
