Output State: **`idx1` is `n-2`, `idx2` is either `k+3` or `k+2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is `n-2`, `idx2` is not `-1`**.

Explanation: The code updates `idx1` to `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
