Output State: **`idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables or affect the conditions given. It simply moves the control to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, all the conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
