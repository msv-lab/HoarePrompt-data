Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 1 or -1, `idx2` is 1 or -1, `p1` is 1 or 0, `p2` is 1 or 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where the condition `if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` was being checked. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, and we simply break out of the loop or conditional block.
