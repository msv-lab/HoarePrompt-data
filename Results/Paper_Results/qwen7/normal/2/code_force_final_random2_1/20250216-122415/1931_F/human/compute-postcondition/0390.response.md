Output State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 1, `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `idx1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx2`, and the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement remain unchanged.
