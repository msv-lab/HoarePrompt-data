Postcondition: **`i` will be incremented by 1 to become `k+2`, `idx1` and `idx2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `n` remains greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
