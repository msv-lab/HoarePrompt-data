Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` contains `m - 2` tuples.
- `a3` and `l3` are the values from the next tuple in `val`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'no'`.

Since no variables or objects are being referenced in the print statement other than the literal string `'no'`, the output will be:

Output: **no**
