Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split, `val` is a list containing a tuple of (`a3`, `l3`), `m` must be greater than or equal to 3**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. The original values of `val` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, `val` remains a list containing a tuple of (`a3`, `l3`), and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 3.
