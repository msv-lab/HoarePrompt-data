Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `m` is 2, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l3` is a list containing the third integer from input and the rest of the integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `val` is an empty list, `l1` is a list with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**

Explanation: The code inserts `a1` into the list `l1` at index `idx2`. Since `idx2` is `n - 2`, the list `l1` now contains `a1` at the position `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
