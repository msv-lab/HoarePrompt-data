Output: **yes**

Explanation: The initial state does not provide specific values for `t` and `n`, but it states that `t` is an integer greater than 0 and `n` is an integer from input. Additionally, `m` is explicitly stated to be 1. The `print` statement simply outputs the string 'yes', regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`. Therefore, the output is exactly the string 'yes'.
