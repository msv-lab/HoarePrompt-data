Output State: **`m` is 3, `val` is a list containing exactly 3 tuples, each tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a block of code prematurely. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that the `break` statement is directly associated with, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `m`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` are preserved.
