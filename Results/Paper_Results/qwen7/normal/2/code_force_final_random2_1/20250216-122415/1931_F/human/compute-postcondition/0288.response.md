Output State: **`idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `val` is an empty list, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `n-2`, and the input is split into `a3` and `l3` where `a3` is the first element and `l3` is a list of the remaining elements.**

Explanation: The code inserts `a1` into `l1` at the index `idx2`, which is `n-2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
