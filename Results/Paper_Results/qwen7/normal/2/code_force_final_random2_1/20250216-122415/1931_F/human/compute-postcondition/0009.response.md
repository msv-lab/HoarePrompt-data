Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from input, and `l1` is a list of remaining integers from input.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input. It splits the input string into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a1` and the rest to `l1`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
