Postcondition: `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, `a3` and `l3` are the values from the current tuple in `val` during each iteration. If the current value of `l3` is not equal to a list obtained by iterating over `l` and excluding all elements that are equal to `a3`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.
