The function processes multiple test cases, each involving two lists of integers (screenshot representations) and determines if one list can be transformed into the other through a series of insertions. If such transformations are possible for all test cases, the function prints 'yes' for each; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
