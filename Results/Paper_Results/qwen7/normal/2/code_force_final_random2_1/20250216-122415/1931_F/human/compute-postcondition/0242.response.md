Output State: **`i` is `k+3`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is either `k+3` or remains the same, `p1` is 1, `p2` remains the same.**

The code assigns the value `1` to `p1`. Since `p1` was previously equal to `1` (based on the initial state), it remains unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `p2`) retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
