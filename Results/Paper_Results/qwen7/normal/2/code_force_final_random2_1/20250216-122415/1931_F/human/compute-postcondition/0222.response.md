Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 to become `k+2`, `idx1` is equal to `i`, `idx2` is equal to `i`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `n` remains greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that `i` has been incremented by 1 to become `k+2`, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to the new value of `i`, while `p1` and `p2` retain their values from the previous iteration, `n` remains greater than 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
