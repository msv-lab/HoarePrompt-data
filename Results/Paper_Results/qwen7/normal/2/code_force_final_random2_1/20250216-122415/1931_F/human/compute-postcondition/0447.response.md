Output State: **`p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is `n-2`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `idx1`, `l` is `l2`**.

The code `l = l2` simply assigns the reference of `l2` to `l`. No new values are calculated or assigned, so the values of `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged. The only change is that `l` now refers to the same list as `l2`.
