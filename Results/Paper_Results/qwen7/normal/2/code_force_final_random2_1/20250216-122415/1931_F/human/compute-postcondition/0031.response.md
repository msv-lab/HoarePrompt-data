Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and the current value of `i + max(p1, p2)` is equal to `n - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that was being executed. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, and the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` still holds true.
