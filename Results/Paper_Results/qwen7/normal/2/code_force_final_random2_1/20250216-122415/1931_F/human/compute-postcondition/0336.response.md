Output State: **`val` contains 1 tuple, `m` is 1, `t` must be at least 1, `a1` is an integer from the input, and `l1` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. It then assigns the first element to `a1` and the rest to `l1` as a list. The initial values of `val`, `m`, and `t` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise by the input. Since the input is not provided, we can only say that `a1` and `l1` are now populated with the split and converted values from the input.
