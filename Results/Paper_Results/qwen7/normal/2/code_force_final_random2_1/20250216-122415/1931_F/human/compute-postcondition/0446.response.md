Output State: **`p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is `n-2`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`. Since `idx1` is equal to `n-2`, `a2` is inserted at the position `n-2` in `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
