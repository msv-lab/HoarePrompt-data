Output State: **`i` is 1, `cases` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[0][0] + 96`.**

Explanation: The code updates `temp` by concatenating it with the character whose ASCII value is `info[i][j] + 96`. Initially, `i` is 0 and `j` is 0. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `temp` is updated to include the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[0][0] + 96`. The conditions on `cases` and the initial values of `j` and `temp` remain unchanged.
