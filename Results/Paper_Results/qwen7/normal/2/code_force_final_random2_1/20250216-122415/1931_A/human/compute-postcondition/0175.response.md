Output State: **`i` is 5, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is 'aaa', `j` is 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `temp` by appending a character to it. The character is derived from `info[i][j] + 96`. Given that `i` is 5 and `j` is 3, we need to know the value of `info[5][3]`. However, since its exact value is not provided, we cannot determine the exact character added. But we know that the character is derived from the ASCII value of a lowercase letter (since adding 96 to a number between 1 and 26 gives the corresponding lowercase letter's ASCII value). Assuming `info[5][3]` is a number between 1 and 26, the character is correctly appended to `temp`, changing it from 'aa' to 'aaa'. The other variables remain unchanged.
