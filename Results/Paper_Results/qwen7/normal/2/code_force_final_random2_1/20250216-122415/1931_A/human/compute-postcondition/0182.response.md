Output State: **`i` is 7, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `chr(info[6][j] + 96)`, `j` must be less than 3**

Explanation: The code updates the `temp` variable by concatenating it with the character obtained from `info[i][j] + 96`. Since `i` was initially 6 and `j` must be less than 3, `info[6][j]` is used to get the character, which is then converted using `chr()` and added to `temp`. After the operation, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 7. The conditions for `cases` and `j` remain unchanged.
