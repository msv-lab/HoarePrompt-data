Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer and is now 26, `arr` contains [26], `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code subtracts 26 from `lex`. Initially, `lex` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 52. After executing `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` becomes 26 (since 52 - 26 = 26). All other variables remain unchanged.
