Output State: **`i` is 3, `cases` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[3][2] + 96`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `i` from 2 to 3. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `temp` is updated by concatenating the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[3][2] + 96` to the existing value of `temp`. The precondition that `cases` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
