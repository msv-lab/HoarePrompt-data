Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive), meaning it will run twice.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `j` is 2 (which means the previous iteration was the last one).
   - `lex` is an integer.
   - `arr` is either `[1, 1]` or `[1, 26]` depending on the value of `lex`.
   - `info` is a list containing the list `[1, 26, 26, 26, 26]`.
   - `i` is 1 or 2.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 2, the loop has already completed its iterations. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the state of `j` for the next iteration because the loop will not execute again.
   - The other variables (`lex`, `arr`, `info`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and their values do not depend on the loop itself for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time since the loop has already completed its iterations.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is either [1, 1] or [1, 26] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1 or 2.**
