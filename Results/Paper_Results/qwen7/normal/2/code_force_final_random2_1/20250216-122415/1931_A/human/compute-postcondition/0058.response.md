Output State: **`j` is 0 or 1, `lex` is less than 28, `arr` contains the element 1**.

The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `arr`. Since the initial state does not provide the exact contents of `arr`, we only know that after executing this line, `arr` will contain the element 1. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
