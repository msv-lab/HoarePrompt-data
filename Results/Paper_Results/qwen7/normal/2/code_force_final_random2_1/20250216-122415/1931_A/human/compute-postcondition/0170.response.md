State: **`i` is 4, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is an empty string, `j` must be between 0 and 2 inclusive**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `j`, which is used in the `range(3)` function.
2. For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range specified by `range(3)`, which means `j` must be between 0 and 2 inclusive.
3. The other variables (`i`, `cases`, and `temp`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
