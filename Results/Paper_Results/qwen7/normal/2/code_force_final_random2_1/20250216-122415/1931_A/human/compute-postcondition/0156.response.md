Output State: `arr` is a sorted list of integers where the last element is `lex` and the rest of the elements are either 0 or 1, with the total count of 1s being equal to the number of cases. `j` is 1 for all sublists in `arr`. `info` is a list containing the results of all iterations, with each sublist sorted and having the same structure as described above. The length of `info` is equal to the value of `cases`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `arr` will contain a series of lists, each sorted, with the last element being the final value of `lex` for that iteration, and the preceding elements being either 0s or 1s based on the logic inside the loop. The `info` list will hold all these results, maintaining the order of the iterations.
