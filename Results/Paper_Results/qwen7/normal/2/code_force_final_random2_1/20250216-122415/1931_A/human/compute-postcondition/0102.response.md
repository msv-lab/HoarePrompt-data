Output State: **j is 1, lex is between -25 and 26 (inclusive), and arr is a list containing the elements 1, 26, 26, 26, 26.**

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Initially, `arr` contains the elements `[1, 26, 26, 26, lex]`. Since `lex` is between -25 and 26 (inclusive), the sorted list will be `[1, lex, 26, 26, 26]`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
