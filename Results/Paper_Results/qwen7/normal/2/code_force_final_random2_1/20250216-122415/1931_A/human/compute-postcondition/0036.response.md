Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `0` to `1` (inclusive), meaning it will run twice.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `lex` is either 0 or within the range [-26, 52]
   - `arr` is a list containing the elements 26, 26

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and goes up to 1, the loop will run twice.
   - After the first iteration (`j = 0`), `j` becomes 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` must be reset to 0 for the loop to execute again.
   - `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and their values do not depend on the loop variable `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 0, `lex` is either 0 or within the range [-26, 52], and `arr` is a list containing the elements 26, 26**
