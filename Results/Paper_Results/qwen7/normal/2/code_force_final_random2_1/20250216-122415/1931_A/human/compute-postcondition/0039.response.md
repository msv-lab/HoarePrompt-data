Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is either 0 or within the range [-26, 52]; `arr` is a list containing the elements 26, 26, 26**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the elements 26, 26. After appending 26, `arr` will contain the elements 26, 26, 26. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
