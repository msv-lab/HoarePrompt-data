Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(3)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the current state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` must be between 0 and 2 inclusive.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range of 0 to 2. Since `j` was between 0 and 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it means `j` could be 0, 1, or 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value. Therefore, if `j` was 0, 1, or 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be 1, 2, or 3 respectively.

Given these steps, let's update the state:

- `i` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `cases` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `temp` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so it will be 6 (since it was 5 at the end of the previous iteration).

However, since `j` must be between 0 and 2 inclusive, and it cannot exceed 2, the only valid value for `j` at the start of the next iteration is 2 (if it was 1 or 2 at the end of the previous iteration). If `j` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it would now be 1, but it still needs to be within the range of 0 to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 5, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is 'a', `j` must be 2**
