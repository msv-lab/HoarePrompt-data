Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is either [0, 0, 1, 1, lex] or [0, 0, 0, 1, lex] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26] followed by either [0, 0, 1, 1, lex] or [0, 0, 0, 1, lex], and `i` is 1 or 2.**

Explanation: The code `info.append(arr)` appends the list `arr` to the end of the list `info`. Since `arr` is either `[0, 0, 1, 1, lex]` or `[0, 0, 0, 1, lex]` depending on the value of `lex`, and `info` initially contains `[1, 26, 26, 26, 26]`, after appending `arr`, `info` will contain `[1, 26, 26, 26, 26]` followed by either `[0, 0, 1, 1, lex]` or `[0, 0, 0, 1, lex]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
