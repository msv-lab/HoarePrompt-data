Output State: **`i` is 2, `cases` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[0][1] + 96`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `temp` by concatenating it with the character whose ASCII value is `info[i][j] + 96`. Initially, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[0][0] + 96`. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `temp` is updated to include the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[0][1] + 96`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the condition that `cases` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
