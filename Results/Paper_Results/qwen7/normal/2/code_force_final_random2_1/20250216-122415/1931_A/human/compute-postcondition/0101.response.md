Output State: **j is 1, lex is between -25 and 26 (inclusive), and arr is a list containing the elements 1, 26, 26, 26, and lex.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the elements 1, 26, 26, and 26. After appending `lex`, `arr` will contain these elements plus the value of `lex`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
