Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is between 1 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is a list containing the elements 1, 26, 26, and 26**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the elements `[1, 26, 26]`. After appending `26` to the list, `arr` becomes `[1, 26, 26, 26]`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
