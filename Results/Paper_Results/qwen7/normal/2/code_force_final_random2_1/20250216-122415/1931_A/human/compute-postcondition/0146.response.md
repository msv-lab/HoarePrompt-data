Postcondition: `j` is 2, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is either [1, 1, 0] or [1, 0, 0] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1 or 2. If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, `arr` is updated to either [1, 1, 0] or [1, 0, 0] based on the value of `lex`.
