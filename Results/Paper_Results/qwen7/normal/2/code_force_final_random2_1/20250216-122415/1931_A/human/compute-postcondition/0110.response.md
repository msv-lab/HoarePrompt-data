Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer less than 28 - 1, `arr` is [1], `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. Since `lex` was initially an input integer less than 28, now it is an input integer less than 27. All other variables remain unchanged.
