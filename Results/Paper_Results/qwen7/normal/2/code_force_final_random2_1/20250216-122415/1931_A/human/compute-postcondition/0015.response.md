Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78; `arr` is a list containing the element 26.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. Since `j` and `lex` are not affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. The value of `lex` is specified to be between 52 and 78 (inclusive), and this condition is preserved.
