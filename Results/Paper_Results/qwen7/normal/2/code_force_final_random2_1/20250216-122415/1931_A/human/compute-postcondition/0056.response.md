Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` as the variable iterating over `range(2)`. This means `j` will take values from 0 to 1 during the loop execution.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The state before the loop starts indicates that `j` is currently 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate for `j` in the range from 0 to 1 (inclusive). Since `j` starts at 1, the first iteration will be when `j` is 1, and the second iteration will be when `j` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop executes, `j` must cover all values in the range specified by `range(2)`, which are 0 and 1. Given that `j` starts at 1, no adjustment is needed for `j` itself because the loop will still execute for both 0 and 1.

5. **Check other variables**: The other variables (`arr`, `lex`, `info`, and `i`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop will execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to ensure the loop can execute for both iterations.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` must be 0 or 1**
