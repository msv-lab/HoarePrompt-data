Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded values into the lexicographically smallest word. Here's why:

1. **Logic Error in Decoding**: The logic for decoding the value into letters is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the decoding process.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographical Order**: The program does not ensure that the decoded word is the lexicographically smallest possible.

Let's correct the program step-by-step:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Determine the first character
        first_char = max(1, lex - 2 * 26)  # Ensure it's within bounds
        lex -= first_char
        
        # Determine the second character
        second_char = max(1, lex - 26)  # Ensure it's within bounds
        lex -= second_char
        
        # The third character is whatever is left
        third_char = lex
        
        # Form the word
        word = chr(first_char + 96) + chr(second_char + 96) + chr(third_char + 96)
        print(word)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **First Character Calculation**: 
   - We start by determining the first character. This is calculated as `max(1, lex - 2 * 26)`, ensuring it is within the valid range of 1 to 26.
   - We then subtract this value from `lex` to get the remaining value for the next two characters.

2. **Second Character Calculation**:
   - Similarly, we determine the second character as `max(1, lex - 26)`.
   - Subtract this value from `lex` again.

3. **Third Character Calculation**:
   - The third character is simply the remaining value after the above steps.

4. **Forming the Word**:
   - Convert the numbers back to characters using `chr(char_index + 96)` and concatenate them to form the word.

This approach ensures that the word is formed in the lexicographically smallest order.
