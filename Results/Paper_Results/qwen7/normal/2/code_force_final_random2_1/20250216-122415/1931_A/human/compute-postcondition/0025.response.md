Output State: **`j` is 1; `lex` is either less than 26 or within the range [25, 77]; `arr` is a list containing the elements 26 and 1.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. Since `lex` was either less than 27 or within the range [26, 78], after decrementing by 1, `lex` will now be either less than 26 or within the range [25, 77]. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
