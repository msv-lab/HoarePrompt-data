Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases` and then processes each test case.
   - It correctly reads the encoded integer `lex` for each test case.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `lex` into a list of three integers representing the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
   - The logic for decoding seems flawed:
     - If `lex < 28`, it incorrectly sets the first letter to 'a' (position 1) and decrements `lex` by 1.
     - If `lex < 52`, it incorrectly sets the second letter to 'z' (position 26) and decrements `lex` by 26.
     - If `lex <= 78`, it again incorrectly sets the third letter to 'z' (position 26) and decrements `lex` by 26.
   - These conditions do not cover all possible values of `lex` and do not correctly map the encoded value back to the original letters.

3. **Sorting and Constructing the Word**:
   - The program sorts the list of decoded positions.
   - It constructs the word by converting the sorted positions back to characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed word for each test case.

### Correct Decoding Approach

To correctly decode the encoded integer `n` into the lexicographically smallest word, we need to consider the following:
- The smallest possible word is "aaa" (positions [1, 1, 1]).
- The largest possible word is "zzz" (positions [26, 26, 26]).
- We need to find the combination of three positions that sum up to `n` and form the smallest lexicographical order.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Find the smallest lexicographical word
        for a in range(1, 27):
            for b in range(1, 27):
                for c in range(1, 27):
                    if a + b + c == lex:
                        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))
                        break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            else:
                continue
            break

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed decoding logic. The corrected approach ensures that we find the lexicographically smallest word by iterating through all possible combinations of three letters that sum up to the given encoded value.

**Correctness: False**
