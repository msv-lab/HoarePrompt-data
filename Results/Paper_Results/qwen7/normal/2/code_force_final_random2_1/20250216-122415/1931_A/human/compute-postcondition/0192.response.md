Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on predefined constraints where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and for each test case, n is an integer between 3 and 78.**

This means the function does not take any direct input parameters but operates under the assumption that there are predefined values for `t` (a positive integer between 1 and 100) and `n` (an integer between 3 and 78) that are used within its logic. The function will return a value based on these constraints.
