Output State: **`i` is 5, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is 'aa', `j` must be 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `temp` by concatenating it with the character obtained from `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`. Given that `i` is 5 and `j` must be 2, `info[i][j]` refers to `info[5][2]`. Assuming `info[5][2]` is a valid index that returns a lowercase letter (which is represented by its position in the alphabet, e.g., 'a' for 1, 'b' for 2, etc.), the character is calculated as `chr(96 + 2)`, which is 'b'. Therefore, `temp` changes from 'a' to 'aa'. All other variables remain unchanged.
