Output State: `i` is 7, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is 'aaaa', `j` is 3.

Explanation: The loop runs for 3 iterations as specified. Initially, `i` is 4. After each iteration of the loop, `i` increments by 1 because the loop variable `j` ranges from 0 to 2, which means the loop runs exactly 3 times. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` becomes 7. The variable `temp` concatenates the character 'a' three times during these iterations, resulting in 'aaa'. Since the loop completes all its iterations without any conditions stopping it early, `j` remains 3 at the end. The value of `cases` remains greater than 0 as per the given conditions.
