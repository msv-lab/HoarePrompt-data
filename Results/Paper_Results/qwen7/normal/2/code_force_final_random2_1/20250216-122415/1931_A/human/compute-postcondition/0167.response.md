Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[3][2] + 96` for each iteration of the loop.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for 3 iterations since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to 2 (inclusive).
   - In each iteration, the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[3][2] + 96` is appended to `temp`.

3. **Determine the Value of `temp`**:
   - Since `i` is 3, the loop runs for 3 iterations.
   - `j` is 2, which means the value of `info[3][2]` is used in each iteration.
   - The ASCII value of `info[3][2] + 96` is the ASCII value of the character stored in `info[3][2]` plus 96.

4. **Output**:
   - The value of `temp` will be a string consisting of the same character repeated three times, where the character is determined by `info[3][2] + 96`.

Given this reasoning, the output will be a string with the character corresponding to `info[3][2] + 96` repeated three times.

Output: **"ccc" (assuming `info[3][2]` is 'c')**
