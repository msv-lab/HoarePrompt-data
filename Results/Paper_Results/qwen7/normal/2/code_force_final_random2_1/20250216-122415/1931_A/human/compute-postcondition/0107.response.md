State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], `i` is 1, `j` must be less than 2**

Explanation:
- The loop variable `j` is defined in the range function `range(2)`, which means `j` should be less than 2 for the loop to execute.
- The initial value of `j` is 1, which satisfies the condition `j < 2`.
- The other variables (`lex`, `arr`, `info`, and `i`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `j` is less than 2, which is already satisfied by the initial value of `j` being 1.
