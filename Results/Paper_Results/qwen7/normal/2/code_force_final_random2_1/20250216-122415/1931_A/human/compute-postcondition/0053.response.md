Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `cases - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `arr` is `[lex, 26]`
   - `j` is `1`
   - `lex` is either `0` or within the range `[-26, 52]`
   - `info` contains `[[lex, 26]]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` in the range `0` to `cases - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `cases`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` from the previous value.
   - `j` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `lex` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `info` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Given that `j` is `1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `1` (since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `1`
- `j` is `1`
- `lex` is either `0` or within the range `[-26, 52]`
- `info` contains `[[lex, 26]]`

So, the final state is:
State: **`arr` is [lex, 26], `j` is 1, `lex` is either 0 or within the range [-26, 52], `info` contains [[lex, 26]], `i` is 1**
