Output State: **`i` is 9, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is a string consisting of the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[8][4] + 96`, `j` is 5.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 9 because the loop runs for 3 iterations, and `i` starts from 0, so after 3 iterations, `i` will be incremented to 3, and then continue to increment by 1 for each subsequent iteration until it reaches 9. The variable `cases` must still be greater than 0 as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `temp` will be a string consisting of the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[8][4] + 96` because the loop runs for 3 iterations, and `j` will be 5 (the final value after the last iteration).
