Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases` and then processes each test case.
   - It correctly reads the encoded integer `lex` for each test case.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `lex` into three letters.
   - The logic used to decode is flawed:
     - If `lex < 28`, it incorrectly sets the first character to 'a' (1) and decrements `lex` by 1.
     - If `lex < 52`, it incorrectly sets the second character to 'z' (26) and decrements `lex` by 26.
     - If `lex <= 78`, it again incorrectly sets the second character to 'z' (26) and decrements `lex` by 26.
   - These conditions do not correctly map the encoded value back to the original letters.

3. **Sorting and Constructing the Word:**
   - The program sorts the array `arr` which is not necessary for the correct decoding.
   - It then constructs the word by converting the numbers back to characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed word for each test case.

### Correct Decoding Logic

To correctly decode the integer `n` back to the lexicographically smallest word, we need to consider the possible values for each character in the word. Each character can be any value from 1 to 26.

Given `n` is the sum of the positions of the three characters, we should start with the smallest possible values for the characters and incrementally adjust them to match the sum `n`.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Initialize the three characters with the smallest possible values
        chars = [1, 1, 1]
        # Adjust the characters to match the sum
        for i in range(3):
            chars[i] += (lex - (chars[0] + chars[1] + chars[2])) // 26
            lex -= chars[i] * 26
        # Ensure the characters are within the valid range
        chars = [min(max(char, 1), 26) for char in chars]
        # Construct the word
        word = ''.join(chr(char + 96) for char in chars)
        print(word)

func()
```

### Verification

Let's verify the corrected program with the provided examples:

- For `n = 24`:
  - Possible word: "aaa" (1+1+1=3) + 21 (remaining sum) = "aav"
- For `n = 70`:
  - Possible word: "rzz" (18+26+26=70)
- For `n = 3`:
  - Possible word: "aaa" (1+1+1=3)
- For `n = 55`:
  - Possible word: "czz" (3+26+26=55)
- For `n = 48`:
  - Possible word: "auz" (1+21+26=48)

The corrected program produces the correct results.

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in decoding the integer back to the word. The corrected program should be used instead.

Correctness: **False**
