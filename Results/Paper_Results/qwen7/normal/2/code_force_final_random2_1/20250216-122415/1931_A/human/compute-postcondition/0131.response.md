Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer - 26, `arr` is [1, 26], `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 26. Since the initial value of `lex` was an input integer, the new value of `lex` is now the original input integer minus 26. The values of `j`, `arr`, `info`, and `i` remain unchanged.
