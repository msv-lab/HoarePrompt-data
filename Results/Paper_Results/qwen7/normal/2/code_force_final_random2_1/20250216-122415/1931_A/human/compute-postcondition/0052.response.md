Output State: **`arr` is [lex, 26], `j` is 1, `lex` is either 0 or within the range [-26, 52], `info` contains [[lex, 26]]**

The code appends the list `arr` to the list `info`. Since the initial value of `arr` is `[lex, 26]`, after appending, `info` will contain this list. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
