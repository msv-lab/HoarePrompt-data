Output State: **`j` is either 0 or 1; `lex` is between 27 and 78 (inclusive); `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the element 26, and now the list also contains an additional element 26.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the element `26` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` originally contained either `1` or `26`, after appending `26`, it now contains both `1` and `26`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
