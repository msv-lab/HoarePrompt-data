Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the range function arguments. Since the range function is called with `range(2)`, the variable `j` will take values from 0 to 1 during the loop execution.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 0.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. Since `j` starts at 0, it will execute twice (for `j = 0` and `j = 1`).

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - `j`: It is initialized to 0.
   - The range function (`range(2)`) ensures that `j` will take values from 0 to 1, so no adjustment is needed for the range itself.
   - The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `arr`, and `lex`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are simply the initial value of `j`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 0**
