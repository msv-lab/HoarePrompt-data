Output: **chr(info[6][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][4] + 96)**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` is initially set to 7 and remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
- The variable `cases` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not needed for the output of the `print(temp)` statement.
- The variable `temp` is constructed by concatenating three character strings derived from the `info` list. Each character is obtained by adding 96 to the respective elements of `info[6][3]`, `info[7][3]`, and `info[7][4]`, and then converting these sums to their corresponding characters using the `chr()` function. The exact characters depend on the values in `info`, but the construction method is as described.
