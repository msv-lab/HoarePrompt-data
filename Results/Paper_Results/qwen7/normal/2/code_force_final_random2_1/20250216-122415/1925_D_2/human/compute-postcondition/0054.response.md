Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The initial values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, `j` is still 2 and `m` must still be greater than 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are the integers entered by the user.
