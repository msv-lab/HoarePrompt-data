Output State: All iterations of the loop have completed, with the following conditions:

- The variable `t` remains as its initial value, which is an integer between 1 and 50000.
- For each iteration `i` from 0 to `t-1`:
  - `n`, `m`, and `k` are the values read from the input for the current iteration.
  - `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input for the current iteration.
  - `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last values read from the input for the current iteration.
  - `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
  - `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, then reduced by dividing by the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
  - `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`, then reduced by dividing by the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
  - `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
  - The final output for each iteration is `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`.

All other variables not involved in the loop, such as `i`, `j`, and any external state variables, retain their values from the initial state or previous iterations.
