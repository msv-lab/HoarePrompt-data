Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `m`, `sum_f`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1, `sum_f` is updated to `sum_f + f`, and `j` remains 1.
