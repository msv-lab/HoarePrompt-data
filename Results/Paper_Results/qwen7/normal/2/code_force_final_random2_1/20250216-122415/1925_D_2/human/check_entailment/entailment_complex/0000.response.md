Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly parses the input and initializes necessary variables.
2. It calculates the total sum of friendship values (`sum_f`) for all given pairs of friends.
3. It computes the number of possible unique pairs of children (`cn2`), which is \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\).
4. The program then calculates `p` and `q` using the formulae provided in the problem statement.
5. It reduces `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (gcd) to ensure they are coprime.
6. Finally, it computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and multiplies it by `p`, taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the detailed annotations and the correctness of the steps involved, the program appears to follow the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
