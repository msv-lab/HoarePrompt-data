Output State: **`j` is equal to `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all input integers `f` from each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `m-1` because `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. The value of `m` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to run. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the most recent input integers from the last iteration, and `f` will be the last input integer from the final iteration. The variable `sum_f` will contain the sum of all the input integers `f` provided during the loop's iterations.
