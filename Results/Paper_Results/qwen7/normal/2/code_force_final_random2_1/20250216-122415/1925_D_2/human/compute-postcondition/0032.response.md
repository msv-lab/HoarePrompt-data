Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and `m`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j < m`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f` plus `f`.
   - `j` is `m`.
   - `a` is the first integer from the input.
   - `b` is the second integer from the input.
   - `f` is the third integer from the input.
   - `sum_f` is updated by adding `f` to its current value.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `m`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`.
   - Therefore, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j = m + 1`.

5. **Update the other variables**:
   - `a`, `b`, `f`, and `sum_f` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
   - `m` remains unchanged because it is not being modified within the loop.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f` plus `f`, `j` is `m + 1`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the third integer from the input, `sum_f` is updated by adding `f` to its current value.**
