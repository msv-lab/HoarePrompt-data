Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to `f`.**

The code `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by the value of `f`. Since `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` will now be the value of `f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
