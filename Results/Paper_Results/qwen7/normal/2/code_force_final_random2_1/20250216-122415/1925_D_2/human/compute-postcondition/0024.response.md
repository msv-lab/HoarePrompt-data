Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is the exact number of times the loop ran, `a` is the value from the last iteration, `b` is the value from the last iteration, `f` is the value from the last iteration, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered during the loop executions, `j` is `m-1` (the last iteration index), `p` is `p // gcd(p, q)`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` using the value of `n` from the last iteration, `q` is `2 * cn2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `q` is updated to `q // gcd`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from `map(int, input().split())`**.

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This changes the values of these three variables, but does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and the values of `i`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `sum_f`, `j`, `p`, `cn2`, `q`, `gcd`, and the updated `q` remain unchanged.
