Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of `f` for all iterations of the loop.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 0, `m` remains an integer obtained from the input, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last input integers obtained from the loop's final iteration, and `sum_f` contains the total sum of all `f` values input during the loop's iterations.
