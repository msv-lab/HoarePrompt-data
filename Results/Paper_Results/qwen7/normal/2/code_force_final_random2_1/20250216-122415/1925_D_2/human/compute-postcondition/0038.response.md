Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to the sum of all `f` values entered over all iterations, `j` is `m`, `f` is the last integer from the input in the final iteration, `a` is the first integer from the input in the final iteration, `b` is the second integer from the input in the final iteration, `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `p` using the formula `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, where `cn2` is already defined as `n * (n - 1) // 2`. However, since `k` is not defined in the initial state, its value remains unknown. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
