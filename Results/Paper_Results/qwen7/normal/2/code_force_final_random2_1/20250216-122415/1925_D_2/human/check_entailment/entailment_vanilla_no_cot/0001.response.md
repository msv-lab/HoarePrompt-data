Let's analyze the correctness of the provided solution step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The initial friendship value of a pair is given, and it can be increased up to `k` times.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The expected value of the friendship value for a pair of friends after `k` excursions is `k`.
   - This is because each excursion has an equal probability of choosing any pair, and the friendship value increases by 1 each time a pair is chosen.

3. **Summing Up the Expected Values:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value is `k`.
   - Since the friendship value starts at `f_i`, the expected value for each pair `(a, b)` with friendship value `f_i` is `f_i + k`.

4. **Calculating the Total Expected Value:**
   - Sum the expected values for all pairs of friends.
   - The formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=0}^{m} (f_i + k)
     \]

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The result needs to be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Review of the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the sum of the initial friendship values plus `k` for each pair of friends.
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Verification of the Code

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        # Each pair contributes f + k to the expected value
        result += (f + k) % MOD
    return result % MOD

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)
```

### Correctness Check

- The code correctly sums the initial friendship values plus `k` for each pair of friends.
- The modulo operation ensures the result fits within the required bounds.
- The logic matches the mathematical derivation.
