Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is the exact number of times the loop ran, `a` is the value from the last iteration, `b` is the value from the last iteration, `f` is the value from the last iteration, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is `m-1` (the last iteration index), `p` is `p // gcd(p, q)`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` using the value of `n` from the last iteration, `q` is `2 * cn2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `q` is updated to `q // gcd`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from `map(int, input().split())`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
    sum_f += f


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f` plus `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f` plus `f`, `j` is `m`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the third integer from the input, `sum_f` is updated by adding `f` to its current value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f` plus `f`, `j` is `m + 1`, `f` is the third integer from the input, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `sum_f` is updated by adding `f` to its current value, `sum_f` is now equal to the previous value of `sum_f` plus `f`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
