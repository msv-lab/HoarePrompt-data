Output State: **`j` is equal to `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all input integers `f` from each iteration of the loop, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` where `n` is an input integer, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * cn2 ** 2`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * cn2 ** 2` to the variable `q`. Since `cn2` is defined as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `q` is now `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
