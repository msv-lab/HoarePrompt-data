Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
3. It calculates the total sum of friendship values (`sum_f`) for all given pairs of friends.
4. It computes the combination number `cn2` which is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`.
5. It calculates `p` and `q` based on the formula provided in the problem statement.
6. It reduces `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
7. It computes the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
8. Finally, it prints the result of the expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program appears to follow the correct logic and mathematical formulation to solve the problem. The program handles the constraints and guarantees mentioned in the problem statement appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
