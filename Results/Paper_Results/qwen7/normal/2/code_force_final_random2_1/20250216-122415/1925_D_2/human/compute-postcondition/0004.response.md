Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `sum_f` is 0**

The code initializes `sum_f` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while updating `sum_f` to 0.
