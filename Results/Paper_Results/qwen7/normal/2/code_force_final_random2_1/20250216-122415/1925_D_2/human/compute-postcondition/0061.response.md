Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `j` is equal to `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all input integers `f` from each iteration of the loop, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` where `n` is an input integer, `p` is `p // gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2**.

Explanation: The code `p = p // gcd` divides `p` by its greatest common divisor (`gcd`). This operation simplifies `p` while keeping `q` unchanged. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.
