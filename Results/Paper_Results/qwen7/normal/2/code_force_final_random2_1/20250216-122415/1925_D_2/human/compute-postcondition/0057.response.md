Output State: **`j` is equal to `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all input integers `f` from each iteration of the loop, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` where `n` is an input integer.**

In this case, the code calculates `cn2` as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, where `n` is an input integer. The values of `j`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `f`, and `sum_f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
