Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is the exact number of times the loop ran, `a` is the value from the last iteration, `b` is the value from the last iteration, `f` is the value from the last iteration, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered during the loop executions, `j` is `m-1` (the last iteration index), `p` is `p // gcd(p, q)`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` using the value of `n` from the last iteration, `q` is `2 * cn2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation: The code `p = p // gcd` divides `p` by the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, updating the value of `p` to its simplified form. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or updated states after the loop.
