Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f` plus `f`, `j` is `m + 1`, `f` is the third integer from the input, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `sum_f` is updated by adding `f` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `f` respectively. The values of `m`, `sum_f`, `j`, and the initial conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `f` is now specifically defined as the third integer from the input.
