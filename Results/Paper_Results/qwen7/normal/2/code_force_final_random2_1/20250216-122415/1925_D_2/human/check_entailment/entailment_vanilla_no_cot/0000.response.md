Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Calculation of Expected Value**: The program attempts to calculate the expected value using a formula that does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. Specifically, the formula `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` and `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2` do not accurately model the expected increase in friendship values over k excursions.

2. **Friendship Value Update**: The program assumes that the friendship value of a chosen pair increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions, but it does not properly account for the probability of choosing the same pair again and the cumulative effect on the expected value.

3. **GCD Calculation and Modular Inversion**: While the use of `math.gcd` and modular inverse (`pow(q, -1, M)`) is correct in theory, the way these are applied to the calculated values does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value should be calculated based on the probability of choosing each pair and the cumulative effect of increasing the friendship value. The current approach does not correctly handle these probabilities and updates.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
- Calculate the probability of choosing each pair.
- Use linearity of expectation to compute the expected increase in friendship values.
- Properly handle the modular arithmetic for the final result.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        sum_f = 0
        for j in range(m):
            a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        
        # Probability of choosing any pair in one excursion
        prob_pair = 2 / (n * (n - 1))
        
        # Expected value calculation
        expected_value = k * sum_f * prob_pair + (k * (k - 1) / 2) * (sum_f * prob_pair)
        
        # Simplify the expected value to a fraction p/q
        p = int(expected_value)
        q = 1
        
        # Calculate p * q^(-1) % M
        inv_q = pow(q, -1, M)
        result = (p * inv_q) % M
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the expected value using the correct probability and handles the modular arithmetic appropriately.
