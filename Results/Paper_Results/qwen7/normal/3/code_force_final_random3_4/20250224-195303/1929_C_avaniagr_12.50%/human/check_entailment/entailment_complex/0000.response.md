Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is done by iterating `t` times.

2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes `k`, `x`, and `a` correctly by reading them from the input.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - If `x < k - 1`, the program checks if `a` is at least `x + 1`. If so, it prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can achieve the goal. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - If `x == k - 1`, the program checks if `a` is at least `x + 3`. If so, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - If `x > k - 1`, the program calculates the minimum number of coins needed (`z`) to ensure Sasha can keep increasing his bets without hitting the limit of `x` consecutive losses. This calculation involves a loop that simulates the growth of Sasha's potential coin count based on the given conditions. If `a` is at least `z`, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case as required.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the annotated program correctly determines whether Sasha can achieve the goal for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
