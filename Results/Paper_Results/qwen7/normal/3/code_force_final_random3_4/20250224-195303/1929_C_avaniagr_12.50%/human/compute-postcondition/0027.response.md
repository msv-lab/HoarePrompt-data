Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `z` is 2 * (`z // (k - 1) + 1')**

Explanation: The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` increments the value of `z` by `z // (k - 1) + 1`. Given the initial state where `z` is `z // (k - 1) + 1`, adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to `z` results in `z` becoming `2 * (`z // (k - 1) + 1`). The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
