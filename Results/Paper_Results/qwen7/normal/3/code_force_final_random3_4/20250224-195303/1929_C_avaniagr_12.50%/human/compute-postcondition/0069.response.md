Postcondition: **`k` is an integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `i` equals `2x + 1` or remains equal to `x`, `z` equals `x + 1` or remains yet to be calculated based on the given conditions, and `a` remains unchanged. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then `i` remains equal to `x` and `z` remains yet to be calculated based on the given conditions. If `x` is not less than `k - 1`, then `i` equals `2x + 1` and `z` equals `x + 1`.**
