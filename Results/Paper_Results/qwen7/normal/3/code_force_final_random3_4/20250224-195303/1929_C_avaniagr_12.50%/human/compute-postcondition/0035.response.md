Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` will be equal to `x`, where `x` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `z` will be the result of adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x + 1` times. Since `z` is not initialized and no initial value for `z` is given, we can assume it starts at 0.
- `a` is less than `z`.

Given the code snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement will directly output the string `'NO'`. The values of `i`, `x`, `z`, and `a` do not affect this output because the print statement is not dependent on these variables.

Output: **NO**
