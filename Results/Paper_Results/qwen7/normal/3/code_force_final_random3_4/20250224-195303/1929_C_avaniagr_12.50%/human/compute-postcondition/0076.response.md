Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is an integer.
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` remains unchanged (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `i` equals `2x + 1` if `x >= k - 1`, otherwise `i` equals `x`.
- `z` equals `x + 1` if `x >= k - 1`, otherwise `z` equals `x + 1`.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement is printing a hardcoded string `'YES'`, the value printed will be exactly that string, regardless of the values of `k`, `x`, `i`, or `z`.

Output: **YES**
