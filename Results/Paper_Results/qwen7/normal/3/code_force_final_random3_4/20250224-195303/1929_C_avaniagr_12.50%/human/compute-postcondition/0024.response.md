Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(x + 1)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(x + 1)` generates numbers from 0 to `x`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `x + 1`. Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 0. However, given the constraints, `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

4. **List the variables that need adjustment**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `x`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

Given the constraints on `k`, `x`, and `a`, and the fact that `z` is initially 0, we only need to focus on adjusting `i` and `x`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**.
