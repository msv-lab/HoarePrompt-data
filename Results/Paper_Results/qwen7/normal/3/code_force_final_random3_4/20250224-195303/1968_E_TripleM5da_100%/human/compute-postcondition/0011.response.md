Output State: `i` will be `n`, `n` must be greater than 4.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop starts from 3 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`. Therefore, if the loop runs all the way to completion, `i` will end up being `n`. Additionally, for the loop to run all iterations, `n` must be greater than 4, as the loop starts from 3 and needs at least one full cycle to reach `n`.
