Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` by converting the user's input into an integer. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is updated to `n + 1` in the initial state, and no further operations are performed on `i`. Therefore, `i` is still `n + 1`, and `n` is now the integer input by the user.
