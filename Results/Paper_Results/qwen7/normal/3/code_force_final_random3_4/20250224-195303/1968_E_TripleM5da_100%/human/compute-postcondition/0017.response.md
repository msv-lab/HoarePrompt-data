Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `i` is 3.
2. The variable `n` is mentioned to be at least 3, but its exact value is not specified. However, this does not affect the execution of the `print(i, i)` statement.
3. The `print(i, i)` statement will print the value of `i` twice.

Given that `i` is explicitly stated to be 3, the output will be:

Output: **3 3**
