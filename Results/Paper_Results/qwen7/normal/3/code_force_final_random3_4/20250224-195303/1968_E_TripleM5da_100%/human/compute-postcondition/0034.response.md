Output State: The value of `i` will be `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 5.

After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will increment to `n + 1` because the loop starts from 3 and increments `i` up to `n`. Since the loop condition `i <= n` is met as long as `n` is greater than 5, once `i` reaches `n + 1`, the loop terminates. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be `n + 1`.
