Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Specifically, the program only prints the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and then a sequence of points \((i, i)\) starting from \(i = 3\) up to \(n\). This approach does not always result in the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
4 4
```

This results in the set of Manhattan distances:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
\]

However, the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) should be:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```

Which results in the set of Manhattan distances:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
\]

While both solutions achieve the same size for \(\mathcal{H}\) in this specific case, the provided program does not guarantee the optimal solution for all \(n\). Therefore, the program is not correct for all cases.
