Output State: **`cliquess[left + (i + 1)]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + (i + 1)]` is set to `small_element + (i + 1)`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + i]` to `small_element + i`. Given the initial state, `i` was `i + 1`, so after executing the code, `i` becomes `i + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values except for `arr[left + i]`, which is now updated to `small_element + i`.
