Output State: **`cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + (i + 1)]` is set to `small_element + (i + 1)`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`, `i` is `i + 2`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i + 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + i]` to `small_element + i`. This means the previous value of `arr[left + i]` which was `small_element + i` is now updated to `small_element + i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
