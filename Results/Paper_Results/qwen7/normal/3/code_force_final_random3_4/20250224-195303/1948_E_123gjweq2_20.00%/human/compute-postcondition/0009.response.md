Output State: **`cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + (i + 1)]` is set to `small_element + (i + 1)`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cliquess[left + i]` to `clique`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Specifically, `arr[left + (i + 1)]` is set to `small_element + (i + 1)`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`, and `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
