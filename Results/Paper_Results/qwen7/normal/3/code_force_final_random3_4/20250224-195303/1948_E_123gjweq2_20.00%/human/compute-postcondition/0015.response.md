Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `not_mid`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < not_mid`.
   - After the loop, `i` should be equal to `not_mid - 1`.

3. **Initial Values and Loop Behavior:**
   - Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 0 (default value for `range`).
   - The loop will continue until `i` reaches `not_mid - 1`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop will iterate `not_mid` times, `i` must be adjusted to `not_mid - 1` at the end of the loop.
   - No other variables (`left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `clique`, `cliquess`) need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head and their values are retained outside the loop.

### Final State Adjustment:

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be `not_mid - 1`.

### State Adjustment:

State: **`i` is `not_mid - 1`**

This ensures that the loop will execute `not_mid` times and `i` will be `not_mid - 1` after the loop completes.
