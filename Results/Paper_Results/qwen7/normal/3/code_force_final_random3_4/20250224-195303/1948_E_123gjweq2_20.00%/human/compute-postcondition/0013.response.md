Output State: All elements in `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to values starting from `small_element` and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent index. The corresponding elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to `clique`. The variable `i` will be equal to `mid - 1` after the loop completes, and both `left` and `right` retain their original values.

In more detail:
- `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` will contain values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` will all be set to `clique`.
- The loop variable `i` will be `mid - 1` after the loop ends.
- The variables `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
