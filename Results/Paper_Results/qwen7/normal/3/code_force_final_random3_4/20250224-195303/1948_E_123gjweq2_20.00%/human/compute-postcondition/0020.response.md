Output State: **`i` is `not_mid`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `big_element - i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to `clique` and the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to `not_mid`.
