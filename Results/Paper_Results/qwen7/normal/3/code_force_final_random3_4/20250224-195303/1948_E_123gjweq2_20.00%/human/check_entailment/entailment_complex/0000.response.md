Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to assign distinct integers to vertices of a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) and then calls `make_array` to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` based on the calculated cliques.
   - **Function `make_array`**: This function fills the array `arr` and the corresponding `cliquess` array based on the specified range and the given clique identifier.

3. **Verification of Functionality**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - The calculation of `cliques` using `ceil(n / k)` ensures that the number of cliques is at least `1`.
     - The `make_array` function is called `cliques` times, each time filling a segment of `arr` and `cliquess` with values and identifiers.
     - The output is a valid assignment of integers to vertices, the number of cliques, and the partition of the graph into cliques.
   - **`make_array`**:
     - The function correctly fills the array segments with increasing and decreasing sequences, ensuring that the conditions for forming cliques are met.
     - The `cliquess` array is correctly updated to reflect the clique assignments.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge cases where `n` is at most 40 and `k` is at most `2n`.
   - The function ensures that all integers assigned to vertices are distinct and within the range `[1, n]`.

5. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program logic is consistent with the problem statement and the constraints.
   - The functions work together to generate a valid solution for each test case.

Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality and meets the problem's constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
