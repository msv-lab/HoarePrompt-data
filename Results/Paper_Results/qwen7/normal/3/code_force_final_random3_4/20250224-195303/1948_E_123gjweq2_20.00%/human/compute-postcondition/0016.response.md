Output State: **`i` is `not_mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `big_element - i`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `big_element - i` to the element in the array `arr` at the index `left + mid + i`. The variable `i` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is `not_mid - 1`. All other variables and their states remain unaffected.
