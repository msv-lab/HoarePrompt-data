### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program, particularly regarding the uniqueness of integers assigned to vertices and the correct partitioning of the graph into cliques. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Clustering Calculation**: The calculation `cliques = ceil(n / k)` is correct and ensures that the number of cliques is minimized.
- **Array Initialization**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized correctly.

#### Function `make_array`:
- **Array Filling**: The function `make_array` is designed to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays based on the given `left`, `right`, and `clique` parameters. However, the original assessment pointed out that this function might not ensure unique integers from `1` to `n`.

Let's break down the `make_array` function further:
- **Small Element and Big Element**: These are calculated correctly based on the `left` and `right` indices.
- **Mid and Not_Mid**: These variables split the range `[left, right]` into two parts, ensuring that the values are filled in a specific pattern.
- **Array Filling**: The function fills the `arr` array with increasing and decreasing values, ensuring that the values are unique within the specified range.

Given the function summaries and the logic, the `make_array` function should correctly fill the `arr` array with unique integers from `1` to `n` and assign the appropriate clique identifiers to the `cliquess` array.

#### Correctness Check:
- **Unique Integers**: The `make_array` function ensures that the values in the `arr` array are unique and cover all integers from `1` to `n`.
- **Clique Assignment**: The `cliquess` array correctly assigns each vertex to a clique based on the `clique` parameter.

Based on the function summaries and the logic, the program should work correctly for the given problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct because it ensures that all integers from `1` to `n` are used uniquely and correctly partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
