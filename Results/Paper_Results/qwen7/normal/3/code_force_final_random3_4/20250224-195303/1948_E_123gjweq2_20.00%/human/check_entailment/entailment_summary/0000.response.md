### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to vertices such that the graph formed by adding edges based on the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.
   - The solution provided uses a function `func_1` to determine the number of cliques and another function `make_array` to populate the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays: `arr` (to store the assigned values) and `cliquess` (to store the clique identifiers).
   - The `make_array` function is called to fill `arr` and `cliquess` based on the calculated number of cliques.

3. **Analysis of `make_array`:**
   - This function fills the array `arr` with values in a specific pattern to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the required number of cliques.
   - It ensures that vertices within the same clique are assigned values that satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

4. **Verification:**
   - For each test case, the program correctly calculates the number of cliques.
   - The `make_array` function ensures that the values in `arr` are assigned in such a way that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The output format matches the requirements: the values assigned to vertices, the number of cliques, and the clique identifiers for each vertex.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided solution meets the problem requirements and produces the correct output for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
