Output State: **`cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + i]` is set to `small_element + i`, left and i retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]`. This changes the value of `cliquess[left + i]` to `clique`. The value of `arr[left + i]` was previously set to `small_element + i`, and this assignment does not affect the value of `arr[left + i]`. The values of `left` and `i` remain unchanged.
