Output State: The array `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will contain the sequence of integers starting from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element - 1`. The corresponding elements in `cliquess` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will all be set to `clique`. The variable `i` will be equal to `not_mid` after the loop finishes, and both `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` will retain their original values from before the loop started.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the elements in `arr` from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will be filled with decreasing values starting from `big_element - 1` down to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, while the corresponding elements in `cliquess` will all be set to `clique`.
