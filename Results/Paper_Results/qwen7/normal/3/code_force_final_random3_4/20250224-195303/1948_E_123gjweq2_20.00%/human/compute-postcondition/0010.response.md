Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(mid)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`.
   - `arr[left + (i + 1)]` is set to `small_element + (i + 1)`.
   - `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` for the next iteration will be `i + 1`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < mid`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. For the next iteration to occur, `i + 1` must be less than `mid`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`, and it needs to be updated to `i + 1`.
   - The other variables (`cliquess`, `arr`, `left`, `clique`, `small_element`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + (i + 1)]` is set to `small_element + (i + 1)`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`, `i` is `i + 2`**
