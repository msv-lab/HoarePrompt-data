Output State: **`a` is the next element from `inp`, `x` retains its value, `y` retains its value, and `ans` retains its value unless `x` is equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The condition `x == y` is checked, but no assignment or change is made to any variable based on this condition. Therefore, the values of `a`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged unless they were already equal, in which case `ans` would retain its value (as no new value is assigned to it in this condition).
