Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element `a` of the non-empty list `inp` is less than or equal to `y`. After executing the if-else block, `n` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, and `y` is either `max(n, a)` (if `a <= x` is true) or `a` (if `a <= x` is false). If `a <= y` is true, `ans` remains unchanged; otherwise, `ans` becomes 1.
