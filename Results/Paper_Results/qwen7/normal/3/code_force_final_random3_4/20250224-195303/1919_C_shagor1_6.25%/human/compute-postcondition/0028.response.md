Postcondition: `a` is updated to the next element from `inp`. `x` and `y` retain their current values unless `a` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`. In that case, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a` is greater than `y`, then `y` is updated to `a`. The final values of `x` and `y` are such that either `x` retains its original value and `y` is updated to `a`, or `x` is updated to `a` and `y` retains its original value. The value of `ans` reflects whether `x` equals `y` after the update.
