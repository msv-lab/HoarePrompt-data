Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer decremented by 1; `x` is `y` which is `n + 1`; `y` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` sets the variable `ans` to 0. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` are updated as follows:
- `n` is an input integer decremented by 1.
- `x` is defined as `y`, and `y` is `n + 1`.
- `y` remains `n + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
