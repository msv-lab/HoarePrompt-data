Output State: **`inp` must have at least one element, `a` is the next element from `inp`, `x` is equal to `a`, and `ans` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `x = a` assigns the value of `a` to `x`. The other variables (`inp`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Since `a` is the next element from `inp`, `x` now holds the same value as `a`.
