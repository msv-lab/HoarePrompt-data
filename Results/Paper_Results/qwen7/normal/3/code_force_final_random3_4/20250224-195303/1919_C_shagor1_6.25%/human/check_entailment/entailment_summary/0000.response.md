Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The problem asks for the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences and calculating the penalties for each subsequence. However, the provided program only counts the number of elements greater than the minimum and second minimum values in the array. This approach does not necessarily minimize the penalties for the two subsequences.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to sort the array and then split it at the point where the number of inversions (where an element is less than the next element) is minimized. The provided program does not achieve this.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
