Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element `a` of the non-empty list `inp` is less than or equal to `y`, `n` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, and `y` is `a`. If `a` is not less than or equal to `y`, then `ans` is either 1 or 2, `n` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, and `y` is `a`, with the additional condition that `x` equals `y`.
