Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for k in range(0, n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is 2.
   - The postcondition is that if `b[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` remains `False`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `k` starting from 0 up to `n-1` with a step of 2.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was 2.

4. **Calculate the next value of `k`**:
   - Since the loop increments `k` by 2 each time, the next value of `k` would be `2 + 2 = 4`.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `4 < n` must hold true.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `k` will be 4.
   - `n` must remain a positive integer and satisfy `4 < n`.

7. **Postcondition for the next iteration**:
   - The postcondition is that if `b[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` remains `False`.
   - With `k` now being 4, the postcondition becomes: if `b[4]` is not '>', then `no_path` remains `False`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `n` is a positive integer such that 4 < n, `k` is 4, if `b[4]` is not '>', then `no_path` remains `False`.**
