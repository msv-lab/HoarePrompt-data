Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 1, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the input string from the user, and the second last character of `b` is not '>', `no_path` is True.**

The code sets the variable `no_path` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
