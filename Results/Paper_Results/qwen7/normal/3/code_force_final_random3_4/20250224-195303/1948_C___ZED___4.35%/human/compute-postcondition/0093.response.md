Output: **n-2**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `k` is defined as `n-2`. Since `n` must be at least 3, `k` will be a value that is `n-2`. The condition involving `a[k]` does not affect the value of `k` but is used to determine the value of `no_path`. Therefore, when the `print(k)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `k`, which is `n-2`.
