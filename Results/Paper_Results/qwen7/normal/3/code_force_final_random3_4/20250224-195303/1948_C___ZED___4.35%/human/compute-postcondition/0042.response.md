Output State: **`b` is a list, `k` is 5, `no_path` is False**

Explanation: The code sets the variable `no_path` to `False`. This overrides the condition where `no_path` would be set to `False` only if `a[5]` is not equal to '>'. Since the code directly assigns `False` to `no_path`, the final state of `no_path` is `False`. The other variables (`b` and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
