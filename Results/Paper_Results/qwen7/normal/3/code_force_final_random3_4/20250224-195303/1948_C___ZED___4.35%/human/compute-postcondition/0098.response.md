Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is equal to `n`.
- `n` must be at least 3.
- The value of `a[k]` is not specified, but it does not affect the value of `k` directly since the condition to change `no_path` only checks if `a[k]` is not equal to '>', and this does not alter the value of `k`.

Given the print statement `print(k)`, we need to determine the value of `k`.

Since `k` is explicitly stated to be equal to `n` and `n` is at least 3, the value of `k` is at least 3.

Output: **k (where k is equal to n and n is at least 3)**
