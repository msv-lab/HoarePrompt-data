Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head specifies the range and the variable used in the loop. Here, the loop iterates over `k` with the range `range(0, n, 2)`. This means `k` starts from 0 and increments by 2 until it reaches `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is 2.
   - If `b[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` remains `False`.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 2. Since `k` was 2 in the previous iteration, the next value of `k` would be 4.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to update the state such that `k` is set to 4. The other variables (`n` and `no_path`) remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the loop head.

5. **Formulate the New State**: The new state should reflect that `k` is now 4, while `n` and `no_path` remain as per their previous conditions.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 4, if `b[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` remains `False`**
