Output State: **`no_path` is `False`, `k` is 4**

Explanation: The code sets `no_path` to `False`. The value of `k` remains unchanged at 4, and the condition related to `b[k]` does not affect the value of `no_path` since `no_path` is explicitly set to `False`. Therefore, `no_path` is `False` and `k` is 4.
