Output State: **`k` is `n`, `n` must be at least 3, and `no_path` is `False`**.

Explanation: The line `no_path = False` sets the variable `no_path` to `False`. This changes the value of `no_path` from its previous state (which was determined by the condition `if a[k] is not equal to '>'`). The values of `k` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
