Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the input string from the user, and if the second last character of `b` is not '>', then `b` remains unchanged. If the second last character of `b` is '>', then `b` is converted to a list, `n` is at least 2, and every even-indexed element of `b` up to `n-2` is not equal to '>', and `no_path` remains as its original value.
