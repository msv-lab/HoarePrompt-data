Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    if b[-2] != '>':
        print('NO')
    elif n == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        no_path = True
        for k in range(0, n, 2):
            if b[k] != '>':
                no_path = False
        if not no_path:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                print(k)
                if a[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
        if no_path:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the input string from the user, and the second last character of `b` is not '>'. If `n` equals 1, `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is converted to a list, `n` is at least 2, and every even-indexed element of `b` up to `n-2` is not equal to '>', and `no_path` remains as its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string from the user, `b` is the input string from the user, and the second last character of `b` is not '>'. `b` is updated to the new input string. If `n` equals 1, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `k` will be equal to `n-2`, `no_path` will be `True` if any `a[k]` (where `k` is odd and less than `n`) is not equal to '>', otherwise `no_path` remains `True` if it was not set to `False` during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` retains its original value, `a` and `b` remain as the strings input by the user. If `b[-2] != '>',` then `i` remains 2 and `n` retains its original value. Otherwise, if `n` equals 1, `i` remains 2 and `n` retains its original value. Otherwise, `k` is set to `n-2`, `no_path` is `False`, and `n` retains its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
