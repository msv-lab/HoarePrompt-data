Output State: **`k` is `n-2`, `n` must be at least 3, and the current value of `a[k]` is not equal to '>', `no_path` is `False`**

Explanation: The line `no_path = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `no_path`. It does not affect the values of `k`, `n`, or the value of `a[k]`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `no_path` now set to `False`.
