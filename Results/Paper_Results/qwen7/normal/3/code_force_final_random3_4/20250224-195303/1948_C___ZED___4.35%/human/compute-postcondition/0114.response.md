Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is the new input string from the user, `b` is the input string from the user, and the second last character of `b` is not '>'**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. The condition that the second last character of `b` is not '>' is still valid as no operation affects `b`.
