Output State: **`rep` is 0, `k` is a non-zero value, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `number` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `number` to 0. Since `rep`, `k`, `i`, and `n` were not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged.
