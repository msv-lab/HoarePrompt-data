Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is 60.
- `number` is non-zero.
- `i` is the second element of `tab`.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 59 times.

Given this information, let's break down the variables involved in the `print(i, end=' ')` statement:

- `i` is the second element of `tab`. Since `tab` is a list with 59 repetitions of the string representation of `number`, the second element of `tab` would be the string representation of `number`.

Therefore, `i` is the string representation of `number`.

Output: **the string representation of number**
