Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates two new variables, `Min` and `Max`. `Min` is set to the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, while `Max` is set to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged from their initial states.
