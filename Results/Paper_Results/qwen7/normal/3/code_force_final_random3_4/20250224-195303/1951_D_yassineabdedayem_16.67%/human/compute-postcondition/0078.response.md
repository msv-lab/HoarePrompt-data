Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` must not be equal to `Min * Max`, `k` is positive, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

This means that the value of `rep` remains unchanged at 1. The conditions for `n` and `k` remain the same. The new values for `Min` and `Max` are calculated based on the original values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, `Min` is the smaller value between `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is the larger value between `int(n / k)` and `k`.
