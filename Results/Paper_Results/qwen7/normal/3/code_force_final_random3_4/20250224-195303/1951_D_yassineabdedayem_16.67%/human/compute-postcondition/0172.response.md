Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `tab`, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, and `tab` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The if-else block processes the list `tab` by iterating over its elements. If `k` becomes 0 during the loop, the if part is executed, setting `i` to the first element in the list `tab` and making `tab` an empty list. If `k` does not become 0, the else part is executed, which processes each element of the list `tab` and empties the list at the end. In both cases, the final state of the variables `total`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` remains as 0, and `i` is set to the first element of the list `tab`, while `tab` ends up being an empty list.
