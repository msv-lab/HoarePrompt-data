Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the input, `k` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the input, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `Min` and `Max` based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, `Min` is set to the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is set to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The values of `rep`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
