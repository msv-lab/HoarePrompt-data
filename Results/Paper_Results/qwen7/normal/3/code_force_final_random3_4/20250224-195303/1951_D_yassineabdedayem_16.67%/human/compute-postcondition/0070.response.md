Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the input, `k` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the input, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `Max` (which is `max(int(n / k), k)`) to the variable `number`. The other variables (`rep`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, and `Max`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
