Output State: **`rep` is less than 60, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation: The code assigns new values to `Min` and `Max`. Specifically, `Min` is set to the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is set to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The values of `rep`, `n`, `k`, and the relationships between them remain unchanged from the initial state.
