Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `total` is 0.
   - `i` is the second-to-last element in the list `tab`.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 60.
   - `Min` is 0.
   - `Max` is 0.
   - `number` is 0.
   - `tab` is a list that must have at least two elements.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is defined as the second-to-last element in the list `tab`, and `tab` has at least two elements, `i` is the last but one element of `tab`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (`end=' '`).

Given the initial conditions and the code snippet, the output will be the value of the second-to-last element in the list `tab`.

Output: **the second-to-last element in the list tab**
