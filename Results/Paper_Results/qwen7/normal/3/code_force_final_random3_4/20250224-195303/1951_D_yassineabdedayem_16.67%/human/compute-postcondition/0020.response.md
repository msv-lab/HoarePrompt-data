Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `n` is `n - Min * Max`.
   - `k` is either `k - Min` (where `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`) or decreased by `Min`.
   - `rep` is 1.
   - `number` is either `Min` or `max(int(n / k), k)`.
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.
   - `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`.
   - `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`.
   - `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must not be 0.
   - `k` must be greater than 0.
   - `rep` must be less than 60.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

Given the current state:
- `rep` is 1, which is less than 60, so no adjustment is needed for `rep`.
- `n` is `n - Min * Max`, and we need to ensure `n` is not 0.
- `k` is either `k - Min` or decreased by `Min`, and we need to ensure `k` is greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

Since `n` is `n - Min * Max`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, we need to ensure that `n` is not 0 and is greater than or equal to `k`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- Ensure `n` is not 0 and is greater than or equal to `k`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `number` is either `Min` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**
