Based on the initial state provided:

- `rep` is 0
- `k` is 0
- `i` is the first element in the list `tab`, and `tab` must have at least one element

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `i`, which is the first element of the list `tab`, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **the first element of tab (where the first element is the value of i)**
