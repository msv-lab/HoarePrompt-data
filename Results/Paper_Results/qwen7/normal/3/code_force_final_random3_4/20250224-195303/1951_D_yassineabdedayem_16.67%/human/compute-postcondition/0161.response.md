Output: **60**

Explanation: According to the initial state, the list `tab` contains up to 60 elements, each being the string representation of `number` determined in each iteration. Since the precondition does not specify that the list `tab` is filled with fewer than 60 elements, we assume it contains the maximum number of elements, which is 60. Therefore, when the `print(len(tab))` statement is executed, it will print the length of the list `tab`, which is 60.
