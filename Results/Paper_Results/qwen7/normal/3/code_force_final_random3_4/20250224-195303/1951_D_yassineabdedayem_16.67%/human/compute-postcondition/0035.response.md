Output State: **`rep` is 2, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`, where `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their conditions or values are preserved as per the initial state.
