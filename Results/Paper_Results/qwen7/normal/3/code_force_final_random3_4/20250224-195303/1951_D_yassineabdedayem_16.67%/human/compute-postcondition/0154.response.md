Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on the condition `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, `rep` must be less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)` depending on the condition `Max == k and n * Min <= k`; `tab` now contains an additional element which is the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. Since `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)` depending on the condition `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, the updated state includes the new element in the list `tab`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
