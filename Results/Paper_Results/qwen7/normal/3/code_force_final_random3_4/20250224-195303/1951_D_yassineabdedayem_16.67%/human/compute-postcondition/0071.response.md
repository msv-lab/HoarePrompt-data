Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the input, `k` is `k - Min`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)**.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Min` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Min` from it. The value of `Min` remains unchanged as it is not reassigned. The other variables (`rep`, `n`, `Max`, `number`) remain in their original states as they are not affected by the code.
