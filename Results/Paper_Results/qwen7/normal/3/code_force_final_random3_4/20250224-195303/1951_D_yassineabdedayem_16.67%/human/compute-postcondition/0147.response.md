Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` must be less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation: The code does not change the values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `Min`, or `Max`. Instead, it reassigns the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the expressions provided. Since the initial values of `n` and `k` are not specified, `Min` is set to `min(n // k, k)` and `Max` is set to `max(int(n / k), k)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
