Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The variable `number` is assigned the value of `Max`, which is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
