Output State: **`rep` is less than 60, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Min`, `Min` is `min(n // (k + Min), k + Min)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / (k + Min)), k + Min)`, `number` is `Max`**.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Min` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Min` from its current value. The other variables remain unchanged based on their initial conditions. Specifically, `Min` and `Max` are recalculated using the updated value of `k`. The `number` remains equal to `Max` since no operation directly changes it.
