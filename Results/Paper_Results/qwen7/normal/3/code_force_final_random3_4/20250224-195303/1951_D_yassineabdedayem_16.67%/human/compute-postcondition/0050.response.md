Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in tab:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `tab`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 60.
   - `number` is non-zero.
   - `i` is the first element of `tab`.
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 59 times.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `tab`.
   - Since `tab` contains the string representation of `number` repeated 59 times, the loop will iterate through each of these elements.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the first element of `tab`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the second element of `tab`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `k` remains 0.
- `rep` remains 60.
- `number` remains non-zero.
- `i` is now the second element of `tab`.
- `tab` still contains the string representation of `number` repeated 59 times.

So, the updated state is:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60, `number` is non-zero, `i` is the second element of `tab`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 59 times**
