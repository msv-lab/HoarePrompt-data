Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` must not be equal to `Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min`, `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the new value of `k`, and `number` is added to the list `tab` as a string.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `number` to the list `tab` as a string. The value of `number` is determined by the conditions given in the initial state, but since the code does not reassign `number`, its value remains unchanged. All other variables (`rep`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`) remain in the same state as described in the initial state.
