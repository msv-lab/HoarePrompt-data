Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` must not be equal to `Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Max`, `Min` is `min(n // (k + Max), k + Max)`, `Max` is `max(int((n // (k + Max)) / (k + Max)), k + Max)`, `number` is `min(n // (k + Max), k + Max)`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`. The values of `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the new value of `k`. Since `k` was originally positive and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the new value of `k` remains positive. The conditions for `Min` and `Max` are adjusted accordingly based on the new value of `k`.
