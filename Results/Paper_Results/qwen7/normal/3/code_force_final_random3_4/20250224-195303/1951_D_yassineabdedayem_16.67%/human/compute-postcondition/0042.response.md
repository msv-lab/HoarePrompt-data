Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is `n - Min * Max * 59` (since `rep` reaches its maximum value of 60), `k` is `k - 59 * Min` (if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k` for all iterations, otherwise `k - 59 * (min(n // k, k))`), `rep` is 60, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` (if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k` for the last iteration) or `max(int(n / k), k)` (otherwise), `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the final iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the final iteration, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` for the final iteration.

This output state assumes the loop runs exactly 60 times, which is the maximum allowed by the condition `rep < 60`. The values of `n` and `k` are reduced by the operations within the loop for each iteration, and the list `tab` accumulates the values of `number` for each iteration.
