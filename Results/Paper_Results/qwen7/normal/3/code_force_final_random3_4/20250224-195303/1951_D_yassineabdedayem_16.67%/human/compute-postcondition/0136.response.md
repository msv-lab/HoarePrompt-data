Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` must be less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `Min` and `Max` based on the values of `n` and `k`. `Min` is the minimum between `n // k` and `k`, while `Max` is the maximum between `int(n / k)` and `k`. The values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `rep` remain unchanged from their initial states.
