### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to help Bob set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - Each stall can have a price per jewel from 1 to \(10^{18}\).
   - Alice buys as many jewels as possible at each stall.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads input values for `t`, `n`, and `k`.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the process of Alice buying jewels from stalls.
   - The key logic is in the while loop where it calculates the minimum and maximum number of jewels Alice can buy at the current stall.
   - If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and updates `k` and `n`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and updates `k` and `n`.
   - It appends the number of jewels bought at each stall to the list `tab`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic correctly simulates the greedy approach of Alice buying jewels.
   - It ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by adjusting the number of jewels bought at each stall.
   - The while loop continues until `n` is zero or `k` is zero or the number of stalls reaches 60.
   - If `k` becomes zero, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls along with the prices.
   - If `k` is not zero, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the edge case where `n` is less than `k` by setting `number` to `Min` and updating `n` accordingly.
   - It also handles the case where `Max` equals `k` and ensures that the remaining coins are sufficient to buy the required number of jewels.

### Conclusion:

The given solution correctly implements the logic to help Bob set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It handles all the necessary conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:

**True**
