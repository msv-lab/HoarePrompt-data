Output State: **`rep` is 2, `k` is either `k - Max` (if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`) or `k - min(n // k, k)`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` (if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`) or `max(int(n / k), k)` (otherwise), `tab` is a list with one additional element which is the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. Since `number` is already defined based on certain conditions, appending it to `tab` does not change its value or the conditions under which it was calculated. Therefore, the values of `rep`, `k`, `n`, `Min`, and `number` remain unchanged, and `tab` gains an additional element which is the string version of `number`.
