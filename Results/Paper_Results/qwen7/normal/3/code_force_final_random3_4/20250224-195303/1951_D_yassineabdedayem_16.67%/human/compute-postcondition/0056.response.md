Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0 or `k - 59 * (min(n // k, k))`, `rep` is 60, `number` is non-zero or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is an empty list or a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the final iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the final iteration, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` for the final iteration.**

Explanation: If `k` is 0, the list `tab` becomes empty, and `i` holds the last element of the original `tab`. Otherwise, the list `tab` contains the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times, and `k` and `number` are updated according to the given rules.
