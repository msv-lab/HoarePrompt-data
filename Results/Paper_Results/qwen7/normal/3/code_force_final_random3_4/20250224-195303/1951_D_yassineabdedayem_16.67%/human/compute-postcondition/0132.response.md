Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, and `Max` is adjusted based on whether `n * Min <= k` or not. If `n * Min <= k`, then `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k) - k`; otherwise, `Max` is `k - min(n // k, k)`**.

This means that the list `tab` now contains the string representation of `number` which was previously calculated. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
