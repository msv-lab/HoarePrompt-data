Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is `n - Min * Max * 60` (since `rep` cannot exceed 60), `k` is `k - Max * 60` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k` for each iteration, otherwise `k` is `k - Min * 60`, `rep` is 60, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` (if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`) or `max(int(n / k), k)` (otherwise) for the last iteration, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` for the last iteration.

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has executed up to its maximum allowed iterations (60). The values of `n` and `k` are reduced by the product of `Min * Max` and `Max * 60` respectively, assuming the conditions inside the while loop hold true for all iterations. The variable `rep` reaches its maximum value of 60, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations. The `tab` list contains the `number` value repeated 60 times, reflecting the sequence of decisions made during each iteration of the loop.
