Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    rep = 0
    number = 0
    tab = []
    while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
        Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
        if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
            number = Min
            k = k - Max
        else:
            number = Max
            k = k - Min
        tab.append(str(number))
        n -= Min * Max
        rep += 1
    if k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(tab))
        for i in tab:
            print(i, end=' ')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is 0 or `k - 59 * (min(n // k, k))`, `rep` is 60, `number` is non-zero or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is an empty list or a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the final iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the final iteration, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` for the final iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rep` is 0, `k` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, and `tab` must have at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop. If `k` is not 0, then `rep` and `k` remain non-zero.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `tab`, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, and `tab` is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
