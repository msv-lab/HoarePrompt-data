Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is decreased by `min(n // k, k)`, `rep` is 0, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `min(n // k, k)`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions involving `Min`, `Max`, and the relationship between `Max`, `k`, and `n * Min` are still valid.
