Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `rep` is 0; `number` is 0; `tab` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `tab`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, or `number`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
