Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` now contains one additional element which is the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code `tab.append(str(number))` appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
