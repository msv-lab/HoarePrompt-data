Output State: **`rep` is 0, `k` is a non-zero value, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input using `stdin.readline().split()` and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `rep`, `k`, `i`, and `tab` remain unchanged from their initial states.
