Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the input, `k` is `k - Max`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is equal to `Min`**.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Max` from it. The value of `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The other variables (`rep`, `n`, `Min`, and `number`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
