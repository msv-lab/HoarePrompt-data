Output State: `total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)` (though these will be 0 since `n` and `k` are 0), and `tab` is a list containing up to 60 elements, each being the string representation of `number` after each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `n` is not 0, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. Given that the loop runs exactly 60 times (as indicated by the condition `rep < 60` and the increment `rep += 1`), it implies that `n` becomes 0 before the 61st iteration. After 60 iterations, both `n` and `k` become 0 because they are updated within the loop. The variable `rep` reaches 60, and `tab` accumulates the string representations of `number` from each iteration, resulting in a list of up to 60 elements.
