Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, the value of `t` is updated to the input integer within this range. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not mentioned or used in the given code snippet.
