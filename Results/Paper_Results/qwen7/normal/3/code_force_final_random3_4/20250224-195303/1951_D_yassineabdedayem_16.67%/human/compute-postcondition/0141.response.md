Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is reduced by `max(int(n / k), k)`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `min(n // k, k)`.
