Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is either `k - Min` (where `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`) or `k - min(n // k, k)` (when `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`), `rep` is 0, `number` is either `Min` (when `Max` is `k` and `n * Min <= k`) or `max(int(n / k), k)` (otherwise), `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`.
