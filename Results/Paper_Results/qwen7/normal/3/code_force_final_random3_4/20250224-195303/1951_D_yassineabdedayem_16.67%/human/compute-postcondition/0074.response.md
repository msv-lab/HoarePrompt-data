Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the input, `k` is adjusted based on the if-else condition, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on the condition evaluated in the if-else block, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`. Since `number` is either `Min` or `Max` based on the if-else condition, `tab` now contains this value as a string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
