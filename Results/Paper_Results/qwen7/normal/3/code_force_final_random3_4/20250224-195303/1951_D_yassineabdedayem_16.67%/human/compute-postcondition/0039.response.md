Output State: **`rep` is 2, `k` is either `k - Max` (if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`) or `k - min(n // k, k)`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` (if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`) or `max(int(n / k), k)` (otherwise), `tab` is a list with one additional element which is the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decreased by `Min * Max`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The updated value of `n` is `n - Min * Max`.
