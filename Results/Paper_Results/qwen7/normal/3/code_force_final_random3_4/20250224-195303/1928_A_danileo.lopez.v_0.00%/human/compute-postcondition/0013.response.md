Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is explicitly defined as 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input, but their specific values are not given. However, it's mentioned that if both `a` and `b` are odd, they remain unchanged. This detail does not affect the print statement itself, as it only prints the string 'Yes'.

The print statement simply outputs the string 'Yes'. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
