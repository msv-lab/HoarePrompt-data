### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can form a new rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if one can be rotated to match the other (e.g., a \(6 \times 4\) rectangle is the same as a \(4 \times 6\) rectangle).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no matter how you cut the rectangle, the resulting smaller rectangles will also be odd in both dimensions, and thus cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle (since the product of their dimensions would still be odd).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that a new rectangle can be formed.
   - If the condition is false, it prints 'No', indicating that no new rectangle can be formed.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies when a new rectangle can be formed (i.e., when at least one dimension is even).
   - The logic correctly identifies when a new rectangle cannot be formed (i.e., when both dimensions are odd).

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the program. The program only checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, but it does not consider the possibility of forming a new rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. For example, a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle. The program fails to account for this scenario because it only checks if either dimension is even, not if the total area can be rearranged into a different rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The program only checks if either dimension is even, which is insufficient to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
