### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to validate the original assessment.

#### Problem Description and Requirements:
- We need to determine if Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then combining them in a different way.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if one can be rotated to match the other.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

#### Annotated Code:
- Before the loop, `t` is initialized to the number of test cases, and `a` and `b` are read from the input.
- The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
  - If either dimension is even, it prints "Yes".
  - If both dimensions are odd, it prints "No".

#### Analysis:
1. **Case 1: Either `a` or `b` is even.**
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, the program correctly identifies that a new rectangle can be formed by cutting along the even dimension.
   - For example, for the input `2 6`, the program correctly outputs "Yes" because we can cut it into two `2x3` rectangles and recombine them into a `4x3` rectangle.

2. **Case 2: Both `a` and `b` are odd.**
   - The program incorrectly outputs "No" for all cases where both `a` and `b` are odd.
   - However, as per the problem description, if both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob can still form a new rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and recombining them.
   - For example, for the input `3 3`, Bob can cut it into two `3x1` rectangles and recombine them into a `1x6` rectangle, which is different from the original `3x3` rectangle.

#### Conclusion:
- The program fails to handle the case where both `a` and `b` are odd but greater than 1, which can still allow for the formation of a new rectangle.
- Therefore, the original assessment is correct. The program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
