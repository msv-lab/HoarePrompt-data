Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\).
- `_` is explicitly set to 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers obtained from user input via the line `a, b = map(int, input().split())`.

The `print('No')` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
