Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `_` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, and if either `a` or `b` is even, the function continues without further changes to `a`, `b`, and `_`. If neither `a` nor `b` is even, the function also continues without further changes to `a`, `b`, and `_`.**
