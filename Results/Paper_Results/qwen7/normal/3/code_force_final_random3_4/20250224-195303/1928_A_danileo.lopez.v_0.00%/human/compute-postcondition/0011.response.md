Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `_` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is 0.
   - `a` is an integer from the input.
   - `b` is an integer from the input.
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, then no change is made to `a` and `b`. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then no change is made to `a` and `b`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop variable `_` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `_` would be 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented to 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `_` should be adjusted to 1.
   - `t` remains the same as its initial value (since it is a constant upper limit).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and if either `a` or `b` is even, then no change is made to `a` and `b`. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then no change is made to `a` and `b`.**
