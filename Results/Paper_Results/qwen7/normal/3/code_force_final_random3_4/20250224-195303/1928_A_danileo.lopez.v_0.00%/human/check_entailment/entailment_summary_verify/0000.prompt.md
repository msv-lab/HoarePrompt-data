You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \(t\) (1 ≤ \(t\) ≤ 10^4) followed by two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) (1 ≤ \(a\), \(b\) ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no explicit return value, but the output consists of 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. However, this logic is incomplete and does not cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where both `a` and `b` are odd but greater than 1, which can still allow for the formation of a new rectangle.

For example, consider the input `2 6`. According to the problem description, Bob can cut the 2x6 rectangle into two 2x3 rectangles and then form a 4x3 rectangle. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" for this case because `2 % 2 == 0`.

Another example is the input `3 3`. Although both dimensions are odd, the rectangle can still be cut into two 3x1 rectangles and then reformed into a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x3 rectangle. The program incorrectly outputs "No" for this case.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
