Output: **Yes**

Explanation: 
- The initial state tells us that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\).
- `_` is explicitly defined as 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers obtained from user input using the `map(int, input().split())` function. Although the specific values of `a` and `b` are not provided, they are assigned to `a` and `b` respectively.
- The `print('Yes')` statement simply prints the string 'Yes' to the console, regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, or any other variables.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'Yes'.
