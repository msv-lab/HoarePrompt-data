Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, two positive integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of a and b.**

This means the function is designed to process multiple test cases, each containing a value of `t` and pairs of values `(a, b)`. However, since the function definition does not specify any parameters, it infers that the parameters `t`, `a`, and `b` are passed through some external mechanism (like a loop or a list of test cases) outside the function itself. The function then processes these values and returns information based on the relationship between `a` and `b` for each test case.
