Output State: **`mini` is `item`, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string which is either '<' or '=', `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`, `item` is `arr[1]`**

Explanation: The code `mini = item` updates the value of `mini` to be the same as `item`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `item` is `arr[1]`, `mini` now holds the value of `arr[1]`.
