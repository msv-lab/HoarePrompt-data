Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`.
   - `i` is either 3 or 4 depending on the value of `res`.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `res` is the input from the user.
   - `arr` now contains the elements [last element of `arr`, 3, 4] if `res` equals `'='`, or `[3]` if `res` equals `'<'`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, if `i` was 3 or 4 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 4 or 5 respectively in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 4, or greater than 6 if `i` is 5.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `mini` remains the same (equal to the last element in `arr`).
- `i` will be 4 if it was 3, or 5 if it was 4.
- `maxi` remains 0.
- `res` remains the same (the input from the user).
- `arr` remains the same ([last element of `arr`, 3, 4] if `res` equals `'='`, or `[3]` if `res` equals `'<'`).

Since `i` will be 4 or 5, and for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 5 or 6 respectively, we can summarize the new state as follows:

**State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is either 4 or 5 depending on the value of `res`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the input from the user, and `arr` now contains the elements [last element of `arr`, 3, 4] if `res` equals `'='`, or `[3]` if `res` equals `'<'`, and `n` must be greater than 5 or 6 respectively.**
