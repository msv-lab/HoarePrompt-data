Output State: `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is equal to 0, `maxi` is `n-1`, and `res` is the final input string from the user.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i` equal to 1 to `n-1`. After each iteration, `i` decreases by 1. Therefore, after `n-1` iterations, `i` will become 0. Since the condition inside the loop (`res == '<'`) sets `maxi` to `i` when `res` is '<', and given that `res` is set to '<' at least once (as per the provided states), `maxi` will be set to `n-1` (the last value `i` takes before reaching 0). The other variables (`mini` and `res`) retain their initial or updated values as described.
