Output State: **`i` is 1, `maxi` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `res` is an input string which is equal to '=', `arr` is `[0, 1]`**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` is `[0]`. After appending `i`, `arr` becomes `[0, 1]`. The values of `i`, `maxi`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.
