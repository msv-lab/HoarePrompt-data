Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is an input string from the user, `n` must be greater than 1, and `res` is the new input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` takes a new input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. The values of `mini`, `i`, `maxi`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
