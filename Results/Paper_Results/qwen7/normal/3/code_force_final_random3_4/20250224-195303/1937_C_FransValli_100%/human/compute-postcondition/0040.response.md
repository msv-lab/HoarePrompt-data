Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list containing `[i]`, `maxi` is 3, `res` is an input string which is either equal to '<' or '=' and is an input from the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = [i]` updates the list `arr` to contain the single element `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
