Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for` loop iterating over `arr[1:]`. The variables involved in the loop head are `item` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the state changes**:
   - The variable `item` is used in the loop to iterate through the elements of `arr[1:]`.
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head, so we don't need to adjust its state here.
   - The variable `arr` must have at least two elements for the loop to continue.

3. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `arr[1:]`, the first element of `arr` is already processed. Therefore, `arr` must have at least two elements for the loop to execute again.
   - The variable `mini` is set to the next `item` in `arr`, so for the loop to execute again, `mini` should be set to the next item in `arr[1:]`, which would be the second item in `arr`.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `mini` will now be the next item in `arr`, which is the second item in `arr`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, but since it's not in the loop head, we don't need to adjust its state.
   - `arr` must still have at least two elements for the loop to execute again.
   - `maxi` remains unchanged at 3.
   - `res` is an input string and remains unchanged unless specified otherwise, but since there is no else part, it remains as an input string.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`mini` is equal to the second item in `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` must have at least two elements, `maxi` is still 3, and `res` is an input string.**
