Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `maxi` is `n-1`
   - `n` is greater than `n-1`
   - `res` is an input string which is either `<` or `=`
   - `arr` is `[1]` if `res` is `<`, otherwise `arr` is `[0, 1]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Keep other states unchanged**: The values of `maxi`, `res`, and `arr` remain the same because they are not affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `maxi` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `res` is an input string which is either `<` or `=`, `arr` is `[1]` if `res` is `<`, otherwise `arr` is `[0, 1]`**.
