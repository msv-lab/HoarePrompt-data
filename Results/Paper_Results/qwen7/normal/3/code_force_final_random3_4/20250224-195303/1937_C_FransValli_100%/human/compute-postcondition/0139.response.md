Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` must have at least 2 elements.
- `item` is the second element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[1]`).

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

Here, `mini` is not defined in the initial state, so it's unclear what value it holds. Since the problem does not provide a value for `mini`, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will leave `mini` as it is in the output.

The `item` is explicitly defined as the second element of `arr`.

So, the output will include the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `mini` twice, then the value of `item` twice.

Output: **'? mini mini [item] [item]' (where [item] is the second element of arr and mini is an undefined value)**
