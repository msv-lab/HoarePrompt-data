Output State: **`arr` is a list containing 0, `maxi` is 3, `i` is `n-1`, and `res` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code initializes `arr` as a list containing a single element `0`. The values of `maxi`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states since no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables.
