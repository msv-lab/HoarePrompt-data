Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `maxi` is `i`, `res` is the new input string from the user, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `res` is '<'.**

Explanation: The line `maxi = i` updates the variable `maxi` to be equal to the value of `i`. Given that `i` was previously equal to `n-1`, after executing this line, `i` becomes `n-2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
