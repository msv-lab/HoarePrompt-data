Output State: **`mini` is `item`, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, `item` is `arr[3]`**

Explanation: The code `mini = item` assigns the value of `item` to `mini`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `item` is specified to be `arr[3]`, `mini` is updated to `arr[3]`. The values of `i`, `maxi`, `res`, and `item` remain as they were in the initial state.
