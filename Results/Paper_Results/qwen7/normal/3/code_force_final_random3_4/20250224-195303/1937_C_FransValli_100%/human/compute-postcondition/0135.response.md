Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is 0, and `res` is the input from the user.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`), the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as it starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`. The condition `if res == '<': arr = [i]` or `elif res == '=': arr.append(i)` will continue to append or set the value of `i` to `arr` based on the user's input, but regardless of the inputs, the last element in `arr` will be `i` when the loop ends, making `mini` also equal to the last element in `arr`. The variable `maxi` remains 0 as there is no operation that changes its value within the loop.
