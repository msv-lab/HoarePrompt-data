Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing the bitwise OR of two pairs of indices.
2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly initializes the loop to handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it:
     - Initializes `maxi` to 0.
     - Queries each index \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\) to find the index with the maximum bitwise OR when compared to `maxi`.
     - Stores the indices that have the same bitwise OR value as `maxi` in the list `arr`.
     - Identifies the smallest index from `arr` and checks if any other index in `arr` has a higher bitwise OR value.
     - Outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the result.
3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for finding `maxi` is sound. It iterates through all indices and finds the one with the maximum bitwise OR value when compared to `maxi`.
   - The logic for finding `mini` from `arr` is also correct. It ensures that `mini` is the smallest index that forms the maximum XOR with `maxi`.
   - The program adheres to the query limit of \(3n\) and handles the interaction correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem's requirements and constraints accurately.

Correctness: **True**
