None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, based on the problem description, the interaction involves querying indices and comparing bitwise OR results to deduce the maximum XOR pair. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and the interaction rules are specified for querying and answering.
