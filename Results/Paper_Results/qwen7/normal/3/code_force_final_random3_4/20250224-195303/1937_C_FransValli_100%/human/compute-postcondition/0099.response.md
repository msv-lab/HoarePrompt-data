Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `maxi` is `i`, `res` is an input string from the user and it equals the new input value.**

Explanation: The code sets `maxi` to the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `n-2`, so `maxi` is now `n-2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
