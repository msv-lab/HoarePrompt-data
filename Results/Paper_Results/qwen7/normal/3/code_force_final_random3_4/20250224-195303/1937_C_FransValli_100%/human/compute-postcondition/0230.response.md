Based on the initial state provided:

- `mini` is `arr[3]`, which means `mini` is the fourth element of the list `arr` (since list indices start at 0).
- `i` is `n`, meaning `i` is equal to the length of the list `arr`.
- `maxi` is `n-1`, meaning `maxi` is also equal to the length of the list `arr` minus one.
- `res` is an input string which is either '<' or '='.
- `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`.
- `item` is `arr[3]`, which means `item` is also the fourth element of the list `arr`.

Given this information, let's break down the print statement:

```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

- `'?'` is a literal string that will be printed.
- `mini` is `arr[3]`, so it is the fourth element of the list `arr`.
- `mini` is repeated twice.
- `item` is also `arr[3]`, so it is the same as `mini`.

Since `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`, the fourth element (both `mini` and `item`) will be `3` if `n` is 4 or greater.

Therefore, the print statement will output:

Output: **'? 3 3 3 3'**
