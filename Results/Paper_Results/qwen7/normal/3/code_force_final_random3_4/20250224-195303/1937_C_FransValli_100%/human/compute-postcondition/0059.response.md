Output State: **`mini` is equal to `arr[0]`, `i` will be less than `n`, `arr` must have at least two elements, `maxi` will still be 3, and `res` is an input string from the user, now specifically, `res` is the value entered by the user.**

This means that the variable `res` has been updated to hold the value entered by the user, while all other variables remain in their initial or previously described states.
