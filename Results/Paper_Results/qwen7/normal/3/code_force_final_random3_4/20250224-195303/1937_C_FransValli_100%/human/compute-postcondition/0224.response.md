Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `mini` is assigned the value of `item`.
     - Since `item` is `arr[2]`, `mini` is `arr[2]`.
   - `i` is assigned the value of `n`.
   - `maxi` is assigned the value of `n-1`.
   - `res` is an input string which is either '<' or '='.
   - `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `item` is `arr[2]`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)`
   - This means it will print a string starting with `'?'` followed by the values of `mini`, `mini`, `item`, and `item`.

3. **Values to Print:**
   - `mini` is `arr[2]`.
   - `item` is `arr[2]`.

Given these details, let's substitute the values into the print statement:

- `mini` is `arr[2]`.
- `item` is `arr[2]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output: `'?'` followed by `arr[2]`, then `arr[2]` again, then `arr[2]` once more, and finally `arr[2]` one last time.

Output: **'? [arr[2]] [arr[2]] [arr[2]] [arr[2]]' (where arr[2] is the third element of the list arr)**
