Output State: **`mini` is the smallest integer from 0 to `n-1`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`, and `res` is an input string which is either '<' or '='.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `mini` will be the smallest integer in the range from 0 to `n-1` because the loop continuously updates `mini` to be the current `item` if the user inputs '>' during the comparisons. The variable `maxi` will be set to `n-1` after the first iteration since it starts at 0 and is only updated to a larger value if the user inputs '<', but no such update happens beyond the first iteration. The variable `i` is set to `n` at the start of each iteration and is not changed within the loop, so it remains `n` after all iterations. The array `arr` will contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` because every integer is added to `arr` during the loop's execution. The value of `res` will be either '<' or '=' depending on the user's input during the comparisons.
