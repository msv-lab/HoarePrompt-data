Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, and `res` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. The values of `mini`, `i`, `maxi`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remain unchanged. Therefore, `mini` is still equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is still 1, `maxi` is still 0, and `res` now holds the input string from the user.
