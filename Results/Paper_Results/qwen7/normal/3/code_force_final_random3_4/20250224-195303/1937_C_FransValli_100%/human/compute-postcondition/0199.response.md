Output State: **`i` is 2, `maxi` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `res` is an input string, `arr` is `[1]` if `res` is `<`, otherwise `arr` is `[0, 1]`**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `res`. Since the initial value of `res` is either `<` or `=`, the value of `res` changes to the user's input. The other variables (`i`, `maxi`, `n`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
