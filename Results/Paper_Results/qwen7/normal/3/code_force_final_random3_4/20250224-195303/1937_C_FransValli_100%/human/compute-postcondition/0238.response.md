Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and interacts with an external system to query indices and compare bitwise OR results to deduce the maximum XOR pair across multiple test cases. Each test case involves a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function processes these permutations and returns the result of finding the maximum XOR pair for each test case.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters but instead performs operations through interactions with an external system, handling multiple test cases where each case is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. It then calculates and returns the maximum XOR pair for each test case based on the given rules.
