Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `range(1, n)`. This means the loop will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `maxi` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is greater than `n-1` (which is always true).
   - `res` is an input string which is not `<`.
   - `arr` is `[0]`.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be within the range specified by `range(1, n)`. Currently, `i` is equal to `n`, which means it does not satisfy the condition `1 <= i < n`.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value within the range `1` to `n-1`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to set `i` to a value within the range `1` to `n-1`. Since `maxi` is `n-1`, we can use this value for `i` to start the loop.
   - The other variables (`maxi`, `n`, `res`, and `arr`) do not affect the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to set `i` to `1` (or any value within the range `1` to `n-1`), while keeping the other variables unchanged.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `maxi` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `res` is an input string which is not `<`, `arr` is `[0]`**
