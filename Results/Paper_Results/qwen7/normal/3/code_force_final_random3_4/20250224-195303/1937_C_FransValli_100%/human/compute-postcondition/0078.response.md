Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `arr` has at least two elements, `maxi` is still 3, and `res` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `mini` will be updated to the last element in the list `arr` if the condition `res == '>'` was met for each iteration. Since the loop iterates through each element in `arr[1:]`, by the end of the loop, `mini` will hold the value of the last element in `arr`. The variable `i` will be incremented with each iteration until it reaches `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. The variable `maxi` remains unchanged at 3, and `res` retains the value entered by the user during the last iteration of the loop.
