Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is a list containing all the ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing strings formed by joining the elements of lists obtained by sorting `[suits[suit], rank]` and then converting each element to a string and joining them with spaces for each card that did not match the trump suit and had a previously unassigned suit, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values where `suits[suit]` is either `None` or `rank` for each suit that has been assigned a rank during the loop's execution.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `trumps` will contain all ranks of cards that were of the trump suit, `answers` will contain all valid pairs of ranks and suits that were sorted and joined as specified, and `suits` will reflect the assignment of ranks to suits as the loop processed each card.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `rank` is unchanged, `suit` is a key in the `suits` dictionary, `trumps` is a list with one element less than before, `answers` is a list with a new element `f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rank` remains unchanged, `suit` is the next key in the `suits` dictionary, `trumps` is a list with one element less than before, and `answers` is a list with a new element `f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `rank` remains unchanged, `suit` is the next key in the `suits` dictionary, `trumps` is a list with one element less than before, and `answers` is a list with one additional element which is a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}' if `trumps` is not empty. If `trumps` is empty, `answers` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
