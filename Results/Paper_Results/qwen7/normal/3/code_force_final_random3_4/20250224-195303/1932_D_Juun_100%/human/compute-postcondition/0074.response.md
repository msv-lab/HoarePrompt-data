Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - The `trumps` list is sorted in descending order and must not be empty.
   - This means `trumps` contains elements in a descending order, and there is at least one element in the list.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Execution**:
   - `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the `trumps` list.
   - Let's denote the last element of the `trumps` list as `last_element`.
   - After removing the last element, the next-to-last element becomes the new last element.
   - `trumps.pop()` again removes and returns this next-to-last element.
   - Let's denote this next-to-last element as `second_last_element`.

4. **Formatted String**:
   - The string `f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'` is constructed with these two elements.
   - The first part of the string is `second_last_element + trump`.
   - The second part of the string is `last_element + trump`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - Since `trump` is not defined in the initial state, it remains as `trump` in the output string.
   - Therefore, the output will be the concatenation of the second last element of `trumps`, followed by `trump`, then a space, followed by the last element of `trumps`, and finally `trump`.

Given the above reasoning, the output will be:

Output: **second_last_element + trump second_last_element + trump**
