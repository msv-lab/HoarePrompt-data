#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and the description of 2n cards consists of 2n two-character strings where the first character is the rank ("23456789") and the second character is the suit ("CDHS"). All cards are unique within each test case.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is a list containing all the ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing strings formed by joining the elements of lists obtained by sorting `[suits[suit], rank]` and then converting each element to a string and joining them with spaces for each card that did not match the trump suit and had a previously unassigned suit, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values where `suits[suit]` is either `None` or `rank` for each suit that has been assigned a rank during the loop's execution.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `trumps` will contain all ranks of cards that were of the trump suit, `answers` will contain all valid pairs of ranks and suits that were sorted and joined as specified, and `suits` will reflect the assignment of ranks to suits as the loop processed each card.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: All ranks of cards that were of the trump suit are stored in the `trumps` list, and all valid pairs of ranks and suits that did not match the trump suit and had a previously unassigned suit are stored in the `answers` list. The `suits` dictionary reflects the assignment of ranks to suits as the loop processed each card.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: Output State: The `trumps` list is empty.
    #
    #Explanation: Given that the loop continues to execute as long as `trumps` is not empty, and it removes two elements from the list each iteration (assuming `trump` is a variable that does not affect the list's length), the list will eventually become empty after all possible iterations. Since the loop condition is `trumps != []`, once the list is empty, the loop will terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, the `trumps` list will be empty.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: The `answers` list is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a set of card descriptions to determine the trump suit and form pairs of ranks and suits based on certain conditions. It updates the `trumps` list with ranks of cards that match the trump suit and the `answers` list with valid pairs of ranks and suits. If there are remaining ranks in the `trumps` list, it prints them in descending order. Finally, it prints all the valid pairs stored in the `answers` list. The function does not return any value.
