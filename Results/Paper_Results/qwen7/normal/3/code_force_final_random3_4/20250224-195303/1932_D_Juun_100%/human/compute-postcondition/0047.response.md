Output State: **`rank` is unchanged, `suit` is a key in the `suits` dictionary, `trumps` is a list with one element less than before, `answers` is a list with a new element `f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`.**

Explanation: The code appends a formatted string to the `answers` list. The string includes the `rank` and `suit` from the initial state, followed by the result of `trumps.pop()` (which removes and returns the last element of the `trumps` list) and the variable `trump`. Since `trumps` is not an empty list, `trumps.pop()` will remove and return the last element, reducing the length of `trumps` by one. The `rank` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
