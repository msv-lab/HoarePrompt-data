Postcondition: `rank` remains unchanged, `suit` is the next key in the `suits` dictionary, `trumps` is a list with one element less than before, and `answers` is a list with one additional element which is a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}' if `trumps` is not empty. If `trumps` is empty, `answers` remains unchanged.
