Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all set to None.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is either an empty list or a list containing the `rank`, `answers` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the elements of a list obtained by sorting `[suits[suit], rank]` and then converting each element to a string and joining them with spaces, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values where `suits[suit]` is either None or `rank`, `rank` is the rank of the card, and `suit` is the suit of the card. If the suit of the card is equal to the trump suit, `trumps` contains the `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rank` and `suit` are the rank and suit of the next card; `trumps` is either an empty list or a list containing the `rank` (possibly updated); `answers` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the elements of a list obtained by sorting `[suits[suit], rank]` and then converting each element to a string and joining them with spaces (possibly updated); `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values where `suits[suit]` is either `None` or `rank` (possibly updated).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rank` and `suit` are the rank and suit of the next card; `trumps` is either an empty list or a list containing the `rank` (possibly updated); `answers` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the elements of a list obtained by sorting `[suits[suit], rank]` and then converting each element to a string and joining them with spaces (possibly updated); `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values where `suits[suit]` is either `None` or `rank`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
