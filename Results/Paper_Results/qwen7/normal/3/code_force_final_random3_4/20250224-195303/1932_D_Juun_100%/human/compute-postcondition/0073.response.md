The only variable in the loop head is the `trumps` list, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `trumps != []`. At the end of the last iteration, the `trumps` list is sorted in descending order and must not be empty. For the loop to execute one more time, the `trumps` list must still not be empty.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the current state since the list is already non-empty.

State: **The `trumps` list is sorted in descending order and must not be empty**
