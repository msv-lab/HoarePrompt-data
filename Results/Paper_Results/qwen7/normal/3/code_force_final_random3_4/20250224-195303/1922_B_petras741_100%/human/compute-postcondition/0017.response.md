Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `j` is equal to `n`, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `eta` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `eta`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `buffer`, `i`, `n`, `j`, or `q`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
