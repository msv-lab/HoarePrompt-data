Output State: **`q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. It also updates `j` to `j + 1`. The condition that `n` must be greater than `j + 1` remains unchanged as no operation affects `n`. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are as described.
