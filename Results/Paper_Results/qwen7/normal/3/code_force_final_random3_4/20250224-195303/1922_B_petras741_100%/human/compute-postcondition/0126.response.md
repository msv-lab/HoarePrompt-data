Output State: **`j` is 2; `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1; `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, this means `q[w[2]]` is incremented by 1. Since `q[w[1]]` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, it remains unchanged unless further operations modify it. Therefore, the updated states are `j` is 2, `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1 (unchanged from the initial state), and `q[w[2]]` is incremented by 1.
