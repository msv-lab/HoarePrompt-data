Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is the final number of iterations.
   - `j` must be between 0 and `n` inclusive.
   - If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` contains the value of `j`. Otherwise, `eta` does not change.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be equal to `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `j = n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Postconditions**:
   - `j` must be between 0 and `n + 1` inclusive (since `j` will be `n + 1`).
   - `eta` will not change if `q[n + 1]` is not greater than 0. If `q[n + 1]` is greater than 0, `eta` will contain the value of `n + 1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is the final number of iterations, `j` is `n + 1`, `eta` does not change unless `q[n + 1]` is greater than 0**.

However, since the exact value of `eta` is not specified in the problem, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`n` is the final number of iterations, `j` is `n + 1`, `eta` does not change**.
