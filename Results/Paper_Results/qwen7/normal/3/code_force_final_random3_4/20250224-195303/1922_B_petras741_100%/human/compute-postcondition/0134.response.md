Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The other variables mentioned in the postcondition are `q`, `eta`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Postcondition Analysis**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` contains the index `j`, `q` is a list of integers, and `j` is an index within the range of the list `q`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**: Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, if the loop is to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - The new value of `j` should still satisfy the condition that it is within the range of the list `q` (i.e., `0 <= j <= n`).
   - The postcondition `q[j] > 0` will still hold true for the new value of `j` because the loop will only continue if this condition is met.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `eta` still contains the index `j`.
- `q` remains a list of integers.
- `j` is still within the range of the list `q`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`q[j]` is greater than 0; `eta` contains the index `j + 1`; `q` is a list of integers, and `j + 1` is an index within the range of the list `q`.**
