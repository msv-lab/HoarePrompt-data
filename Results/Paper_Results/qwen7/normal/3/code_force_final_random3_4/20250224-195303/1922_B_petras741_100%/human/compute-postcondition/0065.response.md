Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `j` is used in the loop.
   - The loop control variable `n` is used in the loop condition.

2. **Determine Initial Values and Conditions:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value is not directly relevant to the loop execution.
   - `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input. This value is not directly relevant to the loop execution.
   - `i` is 1. This value is not directly relevant to the loop execution.
   - `n` is an input integer. This value determines whether the loop will execute.
   - `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer. This value is not directly relevant to the loop execution.
   - `q` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is 0. This value is not directly relevant to the loop execution.
   - `res` is the sum of all terms calculated in the loop if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise it remains unchanged. This value is not directly relevant to the loop execution.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `n >= 1`.

### Adjusted States:

- **`n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.
- **`j`**: The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.

### Final State:

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` must start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0**
