Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) followed by \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 3⋅10^5) non-negative integers in a list \( a \) (0 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ \( n \)). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the distribution of integers in the list \( a \). If \( n \) is less than 3, it prints 0. Otherwise, it computes a cumulative sum involving the counts of distinct integers in the list and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each test case.**
