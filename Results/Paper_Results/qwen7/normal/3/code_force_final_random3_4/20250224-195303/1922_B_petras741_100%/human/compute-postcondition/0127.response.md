Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `n-1`, and for each index `k` in the list `w`, `q[k]` will be equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`.**

To explain this in more detail:
- The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.
- For each iteration, the value of `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `q[w[j]]` will contain the count of how many times the value `w[j]` appears in the list `w`.
- The variable `j` will take the final value of `n-1` after the last iteration of the loop.
