Postcondition: **`eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is assigned the value of `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `eta_ln` must be greater than or equal to 4, `res` includes contributions from all elements in the `eta` list up to `eta[eta_ln-1]`, and `rho` is incremented by each `q[eta[j]]` for `j` ranging from 1 to `eta_ln-1`.**
