Output State: **`eta_ln` must be at least 2, `j` is 3, `res` is increased by q[3] * (q[3] - 1) * (q[3] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2, `rho` is increased by q[eta[j]]**.

Explanation: The value of `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`. Given that `j` is 3, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[3]]`. The values of `eta_ln`, `j`, `res`, and `q` remain unchanged from the initial state.
