Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `buffer` is a list of integers from the input, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `rho` is equal to the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` in `eta` if `n >= 3`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `eta` contains all indices `j` from `0` to `n-1` for which `q[j]` is greater than `0`, the variable `q` remains unchanged, and `res` is the cumulative sum of the terms `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each `j` in `eta` if `n >= 3`. Otherwise, `n` is less than 3.**
