Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5) non-negative integers in a list a (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t, n, and the list a.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and a list of n integers. It processes these inputs and returns some form of output based on the given constraints and the values provided.
