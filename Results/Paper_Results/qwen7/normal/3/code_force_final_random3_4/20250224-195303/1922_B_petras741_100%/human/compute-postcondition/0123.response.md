Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `1`.
   - The increment operation on `q[w[0]]` does not depend on the loop variable `j`, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`j` is 1; `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1**
