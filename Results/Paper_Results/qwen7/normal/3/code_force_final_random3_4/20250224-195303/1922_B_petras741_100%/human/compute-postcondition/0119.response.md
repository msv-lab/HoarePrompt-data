Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `buffer` is a list of integers from the input, `w` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `w`. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `buffer` is mentioned to be a list containing integers from the input, which aligns with the new list `w`. Therefore, `buffer` is effectively replaced by `w` in the output state.
