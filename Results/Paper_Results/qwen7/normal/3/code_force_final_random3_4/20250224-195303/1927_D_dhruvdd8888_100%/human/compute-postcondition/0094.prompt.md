You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `N`, `N` is a valid positive integer, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `s` is `N`, and `arr` contains tuples starting from `(1 + s, 0, num)` up to `(N + s, N, nums[N])`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `N`, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The variable `num` will hold the value of `nums[N]` since it gets updated to `nums[i]` on each iteration. The variable `s` will also be equal to `N`, as it gets updated to `i` whenever `nums[i]` is different from `num`. The list `arr` will contain all the necessary segments defined by the conditions inside the loop, starting from the initial segment `(1 + s, 0, num)` up to the final segment `(N + s, N, nums[N])`.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: Output State: All input values have been processed through the loop, meaning the loop has executed a number of times equal to the integer input provided at the start. The final state of the variables `s` and `e` will depend on the last set of inputs (`l` and `r`) and the state of the sorted list `arr`.
    #
    #After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions apply:
    #- `input_value` is the last positive integer input provided.
    #- `l` and `r` are the last integers from the input split by space and converted to int.
    #- `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
    #- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
    #- `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
    #
    #Based on the logic within the loop:
    #- If `s` equals 1 or `s` is greater than `r`, or if `e >= r`, then `s` and `e` remain unchanged.
    #- Otherwise, `s` and `e` are updated according to the else part of the loop.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state will reflect the result of the last iteration of the loop, with `s` and `e` being either unchanged or updated based on the conditions specified in the else part of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing of predefined variables t, n, a, and q, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^6, and q is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. For each query represented by two integers l and r (where 1 <= l < r <= n), the function processes the sublist of a from index l to r and returns a result based on the queries.
