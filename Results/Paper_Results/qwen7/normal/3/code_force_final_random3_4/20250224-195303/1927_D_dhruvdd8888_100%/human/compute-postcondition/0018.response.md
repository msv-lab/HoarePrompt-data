Output State: **`i` is 2, `N` is a valid positive integer, `arr` contains one element which is a tuple (4, 1, `num`), `s` is 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to the variable `s`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, `N` remains a valid positive integer, and the tuple in `arr` is updated to (2 + `s`, 1, `num`), which becomes (4, 1, `num`). The variable `s` is now 2.
