Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first identifying segments in the array `nums` where the elements are the same and storing these segments along with their starting indices. For each query, it then determines the segment within the specified range and outputs the start and end indices of that segment, or `-1 -1` if no valid segment is found.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Segment Identification**: The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical elements in the array `nums` and stores them in the list `arr`. Each entry in `arr` is a tuple `(start_index, end_index, value)`.

2. **Query Handling**: For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment in `arr` that lies within the query range `[l, r]`.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - If the identified segment starts after `l`, it checks if the segment ends before `r`. If so, it prints the start and end indices of the segment.
   - If the segment starts before `l` but ends within the range, it prints `-1 -1`.
   - If the segment does not exist within the range, it prints `-1 -1`.

Given the logic and the provided execution summary, the program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements. It identifies segments of identical elements and finds valid pairs for each query as specified.

Correctness: **True**
