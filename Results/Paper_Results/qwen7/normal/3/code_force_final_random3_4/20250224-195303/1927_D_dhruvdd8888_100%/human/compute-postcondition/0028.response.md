Output State: `i` is equal to `N`, `N` is a valid positive integer, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `s` is equal to `N`, and `arr` contains `N` tuples of the form `(1 + s, index, num)` where `index` ranges from `0` to `N-1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `N`, indicating that every index from `0` to `N` has been processed. The variable `num` will hold the value of `nums[N]` because it gets updated with `nums[i]` at each iteration. The variable `s` will also be equal to `N` since it gets updated to `i` whenever `nums[i]` changes. The list `arr` will contain `N` tuples, each representing the start and end indices along with the value of `num` when the value of `nums` changed. Specifically, each tuple in `arr` will be of the form `(1 + N, index, num)` where `index` ranges from `0` to `N-1`.
