Postcondition: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `l` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `r` is the second integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `arr` is a sorted list, and `s` is now the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `e` is now the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`. If `s` equals 1 or `s` is greater than `r`, the program continues as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program continues as specified in the else part.**
