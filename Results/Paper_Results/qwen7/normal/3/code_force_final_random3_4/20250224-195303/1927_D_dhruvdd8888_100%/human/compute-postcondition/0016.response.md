Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(N + 1)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `N` is a valid positive integer.
   - `num` is equal to `nums[0]`.
   - `arr` contains a tuple `(1 + s, 0, num)`, and `s` is 0.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < N + 1`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `N` is a valid positive integer, the loop will execute at least once (when `i` becomes 1).

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - `N` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body and is a valid positive integer.
   - The values of `num`, `arr`, and `s` are not directly affected by the loop itself and do not need to be updated based on the loop head.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `N`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `N` is a valid positive integer**.
