Output State: **`i` is equal to `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `s` is equal to `N`, `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `LA = len(arr) - 1` calculates the length of the list `arr` and subtracts 1 from it, storing the result in the variable `LA`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `num`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values. The value of `LA` is now set to the length of `arr` minus one.
