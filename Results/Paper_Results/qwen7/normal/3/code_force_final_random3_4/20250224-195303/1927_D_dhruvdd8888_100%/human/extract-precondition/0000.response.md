Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.**
