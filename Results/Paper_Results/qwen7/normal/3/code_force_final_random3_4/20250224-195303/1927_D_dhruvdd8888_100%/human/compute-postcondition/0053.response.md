Postcondition: `input_value` must be a positive integer, `l` is the first integer from input split by space and converted to int, `r` is the second integer from input split by space and converted to int, `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, and `e` is less than `r`. Additionally, the condition `(e < N or e < l)` is true.
