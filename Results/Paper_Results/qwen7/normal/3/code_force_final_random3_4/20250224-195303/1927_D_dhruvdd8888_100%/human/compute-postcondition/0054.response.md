Based on the initial state provided:

- `input_value` is a positive integer.
- `l` is the first integer from the input, split by space and converted to an integer.
- `r` is the second integer from the input, split by space and converted to an integer.
- `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
- `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
- `e` is less than `r`.
- The condition `(e < N or e < l)` is true.

Given these conditions, let's break down the `print(s, e + 1)` statement:

1. `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
2. `e` is the second element of the tuple at the same minimum index.
3. Since `e` is less than `r`, it means `e + 1` will be greater than `e` but still less than or equal to `r`.

Therefore, the `print(s, e + 1)` statement will print the first element of the tuple and `e + 1`.

Output: **s, e + 1**
