Output State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `l` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `r` is the second integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `arr` is a sorted list, and `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` has been called to find the insertion point.**

In this step, the `bisect_left` function is used to find the index of the leftmost insertion point for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`. This does not change the values of the other variables, but it updates the value of `eli` to reflect the index found by `bisect_left`. The precondition that `arr` is a sorted list remains unchanged.
