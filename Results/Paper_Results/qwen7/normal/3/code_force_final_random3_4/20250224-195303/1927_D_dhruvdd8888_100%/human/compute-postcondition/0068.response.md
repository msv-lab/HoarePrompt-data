Based on the initial state provided:

- `input_value` is a positive integer.
- `l` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
- `r` is the second integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
- `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA` (though `LA` is not defined in the initial state, it is implied that `LA` is either `eli` or `eli - 1`).
- `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
- `arr` is a sorted list.
- `s` and `e` are updated to be the first and second elements of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.

Given the print statement:

```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1`. These values are not derived from any of the variables or objects described in the initial state but are explicitly provided within the print statement itself.

Output: **-1 -1**
