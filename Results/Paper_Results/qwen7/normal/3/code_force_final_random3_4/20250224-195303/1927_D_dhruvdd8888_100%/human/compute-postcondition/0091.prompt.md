Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `s` is equal to `N`, `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1 or s > r:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N or e < l:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `input_value` must be a positive integer, `l` is the first integer from input split by space and converted to int, `r` is the second integer from input split by space and converted to int, `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`. After executing the if-else block, `s` is either greater than `l` and equal to 1, greater than `r`, or less than or equal to `r`. Additionally, if `s` is less than or equal to `l`, then either `e` is greater than or equal to `r` or the condition `(e < N or e < l)` is true, and if `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and `e` is greater than or equal to `l`, the condition `(e >= N and e >= l)` is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `input_value` must be a positive integer, `l` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `r` is the second integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `arr` is a sorted list, and `s` is now the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `e` is now the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`. If `s` equals 1 or `s` is greater than `r`, then `e` is updated to `N` or `l`, and `s` remains the same, or `s` and `e` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `e` is less than `r`, then `e` is updated to `N` or `l`, and `s` remains the same, or `s` and `e` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `input_value` must be a positive integer, `l` and `r` are the integers obtained from the input, `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`. If `s` is equal to 1 or greater than `r`, or if `e >= r`, then `s` and `e` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `s` and `e` are updated according to the logic in the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
