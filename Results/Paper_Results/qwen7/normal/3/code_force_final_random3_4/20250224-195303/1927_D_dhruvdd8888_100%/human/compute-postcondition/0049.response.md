Based on the initial state provided:

- `input_value` is a positive integer.
- `l` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer.
- `r` is the second integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer.
- `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
- `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
- It is also given that `s` is less than or equal to `l`, and the current value of `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.

The `print(-1, -1)` statement will print the values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
