Output State: **`i` is 3, `N` is a valid positive integer, `num` is equal to `nums[3]`, `s` is 3, and `arr` contains the tuple `(3, 3, nums[3])`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `num = nums[i]` updates the value of `num` to be equal to `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `num` is now equal to `nums[3]`. All other variables (`N`, `s`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
