Output State: **`i` is 0, `N` is a valid integer (positive), `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `arr` contains a tuple `(1 + s, 0, num)`**.

The code appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple contains the value of `1 + s`, the index `i`, which is 0, and the value `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.
