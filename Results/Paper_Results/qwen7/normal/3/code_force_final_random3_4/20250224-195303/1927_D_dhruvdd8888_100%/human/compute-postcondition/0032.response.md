Output State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `l` is the first integer from input split by space and converted to int, `r` is the second integer from input split by space and converted to int.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers using `split()` and then converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then assigned to `l` and `r`. The precondition that `input_value` must be a positive integer is not directly affected by this code, so it remains unchanged.
