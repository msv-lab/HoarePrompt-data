Output State: **`i` is 0, `N` is a valid positive integer, `num` is equal to `nums[0]`, `arr` contains a tuple `(1 + s, 0, num)`, and `s` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[0]` to the variable `num`. Since `i` is 0 initially, `num` now holds the value of `nums[0]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
