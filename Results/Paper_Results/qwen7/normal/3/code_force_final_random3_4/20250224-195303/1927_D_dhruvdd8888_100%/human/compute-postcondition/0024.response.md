Output State: **`i` is 3, `N` is a valid positive integer, `num` is equal to `nums[3]`, `s` is 3, and `arr` contains the tuple `(3, 3, nums[3])`.**

Explanation: The code `s = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `s`. All other variables (`N`, `num`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
