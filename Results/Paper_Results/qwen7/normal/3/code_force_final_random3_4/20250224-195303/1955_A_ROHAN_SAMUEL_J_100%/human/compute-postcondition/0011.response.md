Output: **a * n (where n is an even integer input from the user and a is an integer input from the user)**

Explanation:
- `n` is an even integer input from the user.
- `a` is an integer input from the user.
- The current value of `2 * a` is less than `b`, but this condition is not relevant to the print statement `print(a * n)`.
- Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `a * n`, where `n` is an even integer and `a` is an integer input from the user.
