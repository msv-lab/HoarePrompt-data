Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is the first integer input from the user.
- `a` is the second integer input from the user.
- `b` is the third integer input from the user.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2, resulting in the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2`.
2. The result of `n // 2` is then multiplied by `b`.

Therefore, the expression `n // 2 * b` computes the product of half of `n` (rounded down) and `b`.

Given this, the output will be the computed value of `n // 2 * b`.

Output: **n // 2 * b (where n is the first integer input from the user and b is the third integer input from the user)**
