Output State: The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop have finished. The loop processes each set of inputs (`n`, `a`, `b`) independently based on the given conditions and prints the result, but it does not modify the values of `n`, `a`, or `b` within the loop itself. Therefore, after all iterations, `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values from the last input provided.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the same as the values of the last set of inputs provided to the loop. The loop does not alter these values; it only uses them to perform calculations and prints the results.
