Reasoning:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The program correctly iterates over each test case using a loop. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` and processes them according to the problem statement.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts**: 
   - If `n` is odd, the program checks whether buying two yogurts for `b` burles is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually at `a` burles. This is done with the condition `if 2 * a < b`.
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper, so the program calculates the total cost as `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` because `n // 2` pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price, and the remaining one yogurt is bought at the regular price.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `n` is even, the program directly checks if buying two yogurts for `b` burles is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually at `a` burles.
   - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper, so the program calculates the total cost as `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` because all pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price.

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case as required.

5. **Final Values**: The final values of `n`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the output since the loop processes each set of inputs independently and does not modify the variables outside the loop.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
