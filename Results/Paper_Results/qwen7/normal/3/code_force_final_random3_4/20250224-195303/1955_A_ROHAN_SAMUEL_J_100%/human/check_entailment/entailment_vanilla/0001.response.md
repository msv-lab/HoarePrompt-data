Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd (`n % 2`).
     - If `n` is odd, it further checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually.
       - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
       - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the individual price.
         - The cost is calculated as `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - If `n` is even, it directly checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying all pairs at the promotion price.
       - The cost is calculated as `n // 2 * b`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input: 
  ```
  2 5 9
  ```
- Output:
  ```
  9
  ```
- Explanation:
  - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 > 9`, the cost is `2 * 5 = 10`. However, the output is `9`, which suggests an error in the logic.

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  3 5 9
  ```
- Output:
  ```
  14
  ```
- Explanation:
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 > 9`, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`. However, the output is `14`, which suggests an error in the logic.

#### Example 3:
- Input:
  ```
  3 5 11
  ```
- Output:
  ```
  15
  ```
- Explanation:
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 < 11`, the cost is `2 * 11 + 5 = 22 + 5 = 15`. The output is correct.

#### Example 4:
- Input:
  ```
  4 5 11
  ```
- Output:
  ```
  20
  ```
- Explanation:
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 < 11`, the cost is `4 * 5 = 20`. The output is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program has logical errors in handling the cases where `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`. Specifically, the cost calculation for odd `n` when `2 * a < b` is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
