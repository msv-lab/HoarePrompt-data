Output: **n // 2 * b (where n is the first integer entered, and b is the third integer entered)**

Explanation:
- `n` is the first integer entered.
- `b` is the third integer entered.
- The expression `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2, resulting in the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2`.
- This result is then multiplied by `b`.
- Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `n // 2 * b`.
