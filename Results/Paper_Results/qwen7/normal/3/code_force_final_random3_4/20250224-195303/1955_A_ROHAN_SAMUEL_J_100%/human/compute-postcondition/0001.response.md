Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `a` is an integer input from the user, `b` is an integer input from the user**.

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The initial state of these variables is now set to the integers input by the user.
