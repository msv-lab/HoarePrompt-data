Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case.
3. The logic inside the loop checks whether it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually or in pairs based on the given conditions.
   - If `n` is odd, it compares the cost of buying `(n-1)/2` pairs and one individual yogurt with the cost of buying `n` individual yogurts.
   - If `n` is even, it directly compares the cost of buying `n/2` pairs with the cost of buying `n` individual yogurts.
4. The program correctly handles both cases and prints the minimum cost for each test case.
5. The program does not modify the input values `n`, `a`, and `b` across different test cases, which is consistent with the problem statement.
6. The logic and conditions in the program match the problem description accurately.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
