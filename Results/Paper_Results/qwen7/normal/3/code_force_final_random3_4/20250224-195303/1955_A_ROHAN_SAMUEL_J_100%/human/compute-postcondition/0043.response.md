Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on specific conditions. The function does not modify the input values \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) across different test cases. After processing all test cases, the final values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) are the same as the values of the last set of inputs provided.**
