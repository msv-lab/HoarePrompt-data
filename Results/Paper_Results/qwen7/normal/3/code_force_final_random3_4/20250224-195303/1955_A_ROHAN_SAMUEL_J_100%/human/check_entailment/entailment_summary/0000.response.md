Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the logic for determining the minimum cost based on the given conditions.
- It checks if the number of yogurts \( n \) is odd or even.
- If \( n \) is odd, it compares the cost of buying \( n \) yogurts individually (\( n \times a \)) with the cost of buying \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (\( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \times b \)) plus one individual yogurt at the regular price (\( a \)).
- If \( n \) is even, it directly compares the cost of buying \( n \) yogurts individually (\( n \times a \)) with the cost of buying \( \frac{n}{2} \) pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (\( \frac{n}{2} \times b \)).
- The program correctly uses the condition \( 2 \times a < b \) to decide whether it's cheaper to buy individual yogurts or take advantage of the promotion.
- The function processes each test case independently without carrying over values from one test case to another, which is appropriate for this problem.
- The logic matches the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
