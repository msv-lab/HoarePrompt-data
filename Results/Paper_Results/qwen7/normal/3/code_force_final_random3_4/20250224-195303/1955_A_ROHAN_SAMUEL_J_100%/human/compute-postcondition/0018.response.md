Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved in this loop head is `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `a` is an integer input from the user.
   - `b` is an integer input from the user.
   - The postcondition states that if `n` is odd or even, the condition remains unchanged regardless of the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop continues based on the input from the user, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `n` (which is the input from the user).
   - The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The new state should reflect that `n` is the next integer input from the user, and `a` and `b` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `a` is an integer input from the user, `b` is an integer input from the user**.
