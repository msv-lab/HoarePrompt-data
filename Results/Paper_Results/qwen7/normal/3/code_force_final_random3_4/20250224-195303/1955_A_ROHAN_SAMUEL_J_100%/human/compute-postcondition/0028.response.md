Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved in the loop head is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a dummy variable and does not hold any specific value.
   - Additionally, the loop body modifies or uses `n`, `a`, and `b`, but these are not part of the loop head.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer value.
   - Since the loop body does not modify `n`, `a`, or `b`, and the postcondition states that their values remain unchanged regardless of the condition `n % 2`, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` do not change within the loop.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only thing that changes at each iteration is the input provided by `int(input())`, which determines whether the loop continues.
   - However, since the task specifies adjusting the states based on the loop head, and there are no variables in the loop head other than the dummy `_`, the states of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states of `n`, `a`, and `b` do not need to be adjusted because they remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, and their values remain unchanged.**
