Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, and now `n` is the first integer entered, `a` is the second integer entered, and `b` is the third integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged before the assignment, but after the assignment, `n` will hold the first integer entered, `a` will hold the second integer entered, and `b` will hold the third integer entered.
