### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice picks elements and appends them to her array `c`, while Bob only removes elements from `a`. The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of `c` at the end of the game, assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: To maximize the MEX, Alice should aim to include as many unique numbers as possible in her array `c`, while Bob should try to minimize the MEX by removing numbers that could potentially increase the MEX.

3. **Key Observation**: The optimal strategy for Alice is to ensure that she includes all numbers from `0` to `N-1` in her array `c` if possible, because the MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. If Alice can include all numbers from `0` to `N-1` in `c`, the MEX would be `N`.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the MEX of `c` based on the optimal play of both players.
   - The code counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using a `defaultdict`.
   - The logic inside the second loop does not correctly simulate the game or determine the MEX. Specifically, the condition `if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:` is not relevant to the game's outcome and does not reflect the optimal strategy.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Alice should pick elements from `a` to fill her array `c` with all numbers from `0` to `N-1` if possible.
   - Bob will remove elements to prevent Alice from achieving this.
   - The optimal strategy leads to the MEX being determined by the highest number that cannot be included in `c` due to Bob's removals.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the optimal MEX for the given game. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
