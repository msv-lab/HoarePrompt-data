Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `i`, and it ranges from `0` to `N-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `N` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with all values initialized to 0.
   - `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < N`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one less than the current value of `N`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `N`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `t` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop.
- `N` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- `a` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- `cnt` will be updated based on the current value of `i`, but since we are looking at the state before the update, `cnt` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to `i + 1`.

**Final State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- `N` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with all values initialized to 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with all values initialized to 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.
