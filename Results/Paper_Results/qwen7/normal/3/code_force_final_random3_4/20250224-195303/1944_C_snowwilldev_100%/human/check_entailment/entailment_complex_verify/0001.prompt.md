You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), an integer representing the size of the array a, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n), where the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed all its iterations, meaning `i` will be equal to `N-1`. For each element `a[i]` in the list `a`, the value of `cnt[a[i]]` will be incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `a[i]` in the list `a`. Therefore, `cnt` will contain the count of each integer present in the list `a`.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `N` is the number of elements in the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is a `defaultdict` where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the function has returned 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input array of integers and counts the occurrences of each integer in the array using a `defaultdict`. It then iterates through the possible values (0 to N) and checks the count of each value. If a value occurs exactly once, it increments a counter `t`. Once `t` reaches 2 or if a value does not occur at all, the function returns that value. If no such value is found, the function returns 2. The function ultimately returns either 0, 1, or 2 based on the conditions met during its execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   
2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the size of the array `N` is read.
   - The elements of the array `a` are read and stored.
   - A dictionary `cnt` is used to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.

4. **Calculating MEX:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to 0.
   - The program iterates from 0 to `N` and checks the count of each integer `i` in `cnt`.
   - If `cnt[i]` is exactly 1, `t` is incremented.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` becomes 0, the function returns `i`.

### Correctness Analysis

To determine the correctness, we need to verify if the logic inside `func_1()` aligns with the optimal strategy for the game described.

#### Key Points:
- **Alice's Strategy:** Alice can always pick any available element from `a` and append it to `c`.
- **Bob's Strategy:** Bob can only remove an element from `a` without affecting the order.
- **MEX Calculation:** The goal is to find the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

#### Issues in the Given Code:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation:**
   - The code attempts to find the smallest integer `i` such that `cnt[i] == 1` or `cnt[i] == 0` and increments `t` until `t >= 2`.
   - This approach does not guarantee finding the MEX optimally. It only checks for the presence of specific counts rather than the actual absence of numbers in `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To achieve the optimal MEX, we need to ensure that the sequence of moves by Alice and Bob results in the correct MEX value.
   - Alice should aim to create gaps in the sequence to maximize the MEX, while Bob should try to fill these gaps to minimize the MEX.

#### Example Counter-Example:
Consider the input:
```
2
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
```

- For the first test case, the optimal sequence might be:
  1. Alice picks 1 → `a = [0, 0, 1]`, `c = [1]`.
  2. Bob picks 0 → `a = [0, 1]`, `c = [1]`.
  3. Alice picks 0 → `a = [1]`, `c = [1, 0]`.
  4. Bob picks 1 → `a = []`, `c = [1, 0]`.
  - Final `c = [1, 0]`, MEX = 2.

- For the second test case, the optimal sequence might be:
  1. Alice picks 0 → `a = [1, 2, 3]`, `c = [0]`.
  2. Bob picks 1 → `a = [2, 3]`, `c = [0]`.
  3. Alice picks 2 → `a = [3]`, `c = [0, 2]`.
  4. Bob picks 3 → `a = []`, `c = [0, 2]`.
  - Final `c = [0, 2]`, MEX = 1.

The given code does not implement the optimal strategy and thus will not produce the correct MEX values in all cases.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for calculating the MEX. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
