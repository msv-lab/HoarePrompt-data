Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < N + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `N` is the number of elements in the list `a`
   - `t` is set to 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < N + 1`, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `N + 1`. Therefore, `i` should be 1 and `N` must remain the same.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` is now 1
   - `N` remains the number of elements in the list `a`
   - `t` remains set to 1 (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 1, `N` is the number of elements in the list `a`, and `t` is set to 1**
