Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Turn-based Game Logic**: The problem specifies that Alice and Bob take turns playing, with Alice starting first. However, the provided code does not simulate these turns. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of each integer in the array and determines the MEX based on those counts without considering whose turn it is.

2. **Alice's and Bob's Strategies**: Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob tries to minimize it. The current implementation does not account for these strategies. Specifically, it does not ensure that Alice always picks elements in a way that maximizes the MEX and Bob always picks elements in a way that minimizes it.

3. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX is calculated based on the counts of each integer, but the program does not consider the sequence of moves made by Alice and Bob. The MEX should be determined after all elements have been picked and deleted according to the rules of the game.

4. **Return Values**: The function returns 0, 1, or 2 based on certain conditions, but these conditions do not reflect the optimal strategy for both players. The conditions are too simplistic and do not capture the complexity of the game.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX based on the rules described.

Correctness: **False**
