You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), an integer representing the size of the array a, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n), where the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed all its iterations, meaning `i` will be equal to `N-1`. For each element `a[i]` in the list `a`, the value of `cnt[a[i]]` will be incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `a[i]` in the list `a`. Therefore, `cnt` will contain the count of each integer present in the list `a`.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `N` is the number of elements in the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is a `defaultdict` where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the function has returned 2.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Alice can pick any element from the array `a` on her turn, and Bob can only pick elements that are still present in `a`. The current implementation of `func_1` simply counts the occurrences of each number in the array and returns the smallest index that either has exactly one occurrence or has no occurrences. This does not reflect the strategic nature of the game where players aim to maximize or minimize the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

The output of the provided program is:
```
2
1
0
```

However, let's analyze the first test case:
- Alice picks `0`, so `a = [0, 1]` and `c = [0]`.
- Bob picks `0`, so `a = [1]` and `c = [0]`.
- Alice picks `1`, so `a = []` and `c = [0, 1]`.

In this scenario, the MEX of `c = [0, 1]` is `2`, which matches the expected output. However, the program does not simulate the turns correctly. It simply counts the occurrences and returns the smallest index that meets the criteria, without considering the sequence of moves.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and ensure that the MEX of the resulting array `c` is calculated accurately based on the optimal strategies of both players. The current implementation does not handle the strategic aspects of the game, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
