Output State: **The program returns 2**

Based on the initial state, `i` is 2, and `t` is 2 unless `cnt[i]` equals 1. The code snippet `return i` simply returns the value of `i`. Since there is no information indicating that `cnt[i]` (where `i` is 2) equals 1, `i` remains 2. Therefore, the program returns 2.
