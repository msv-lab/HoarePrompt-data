Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Alice can pick any element from the array `a` on her turn, and Bob can only pick elements that are still present in `a`. The current implementation of `func_1` simply counts the occurrences of each number in the array and returns the smallest index that either has exactly one occurrence or has no occurrences. This does not reflect the strategic nature of the game where players aim to maximize or minimize the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

The output of the provided program is:
```
2
1
0
```

However, let's analyze the first test case:
- Alice picks `0`, so `a = [0, 1]` and `c = [0]`.
- Bob picks `0`, so `a = [1]` and `c = [0]`.
- Alice picks `1`, so `a = []` and `c = [0, 1]`.

In this scenario, the MEX of `c = [0, 1]` is `2`, which matches the expected output. However, the program does not simulate the turns correctly. It simply counts the occurrences and returns the smallest index that meets the criteria, without considering the sequence of moves.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and ensure that the MEX of the resulting array `c` is calculated accurately based on the optimal strategies of both players. The current implementation does not handle the strategic aspects of the game, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
