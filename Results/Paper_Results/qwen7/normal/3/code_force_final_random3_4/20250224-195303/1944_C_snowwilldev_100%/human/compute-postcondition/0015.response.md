Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 0, `N` is the number of elements in the list `a`, and `cnt[i]` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is not relevant since it's not mentioned). The other variables (`i`, `N`, and `cnt[i]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` becomes 1, while `i`, `N`, and `cnt[i]` retain their original values.
