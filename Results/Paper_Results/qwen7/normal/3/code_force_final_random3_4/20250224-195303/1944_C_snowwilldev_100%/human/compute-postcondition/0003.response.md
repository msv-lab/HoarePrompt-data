Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter and will start from 0 in each iteration.
   - The variable `N` determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `N` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 in each iteration, we don't need to explicitly set its initial value; it will be incremented within the loop.
   - `N` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `N` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, N must be greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, cnt is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0**
