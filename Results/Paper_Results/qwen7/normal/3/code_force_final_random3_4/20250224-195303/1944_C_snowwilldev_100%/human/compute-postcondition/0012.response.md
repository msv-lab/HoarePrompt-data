Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `N`**:
   - `i` is the loop variable, and it starts from 0 (as per the typical behavior of `range(N + 1)`).
   - `N` is the number of elements in the list `a`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `N`. Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute for all values of `i` from 0 to `N`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be set to 0 initially.
   - `N` should be correctly reflecting the number of elements in the list `a`.

5. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - `t` is not part of the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted.
   - `a` is a list of integers, and its state is not directly relevant to the loop head.
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` and its state is not directly relevant to the loop head.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `N`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `N` is the number of elements in the list `a`**
