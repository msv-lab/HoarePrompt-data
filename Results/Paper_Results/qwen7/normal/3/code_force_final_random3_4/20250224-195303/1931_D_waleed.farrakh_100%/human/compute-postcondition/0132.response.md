Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` and `y` (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and `arr` (a list of integers representing the elements of the array). The function processes each tuple in `test_cases`, calculates the frequency of certain pairs derived from elements in `arr`, and appends a count to the `results` list. However, since no iterations are performed (as indicated by the return postconditions), the function returns an empty list.**
