Postcondition: `count` is either `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, or remains unchanged as `0` if `(rx, ry)` is not in `freq`; `n` is the first element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`; `x` is the second element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`; `y` is the third element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is a list with at least one element; `freq` is a dictionary; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `ry` is `a % y`. The current pair `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`.
