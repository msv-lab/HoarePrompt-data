Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` list to store the results for each test case.
   - `freq` dictionary to keep track of the frequency of `(a % x, a % y)` pairs.
   - `count` variable to count the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array:
     - Compute `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` which ensures `rx` is non-negative.
     - Compute `ry = a % y`.
     - Check if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, add the count of this pair to `count`.
     - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

3. **Appending results**:
   - Append the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to `results`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Uses `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once.
   - Splits the input into lines.
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Iterates over each test case.
   - Extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.
   - Appends the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to `test_cases`.

3. **Calling `func_1`**:
   - Calls `func_1` with `test_cases` and stores the results.

4. **Printing Results**:
   - Iterates over the results and prints each one.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Correctness of Pair Calculation**:
   - The logic for calculating `rx` ensures that the remainder is non-negative.
   - The condition for a pair being "beautiful" is correctly checked using the modulo operations.
   - The frequency counting mechanism is correctly implemented.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - The solution uses a hash map (`freq`) to count occurrences efficiently.
   - The time complexity is O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

3. **Handling of Input**:
   - The input reading mechanism is efficient and handles large inputs well.
   - The parsing of test cases is done correctly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and implementation are correct according to the problem statement. The program correctly identifies and counts the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
