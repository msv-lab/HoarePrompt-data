Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing two tuples [(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr)], `idx` is `idx + 4`, `t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an integer from `data[idx].split()`, `x` is an integer from `data[idx].split()`, `y` is an integer from `data[idx].split()`, `arr` is a list of integers converted from `data[idx + 1].split()`**.

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())` extracts three integers from the string at `data[idx]` and assigns them to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The values of `test_cases`, `idx`, and `t` remain unchanged except that `idx` is updated to `idx + 4` and `t` is updated to `t - 2`. The `arr` list is updated to contain integers converted from the string at `data[idx + 1]`.
