Output State: `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple in the form (n, x, y, arr), where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, and `arr` is a list of integers. The value of `idx` is `idx + 2 * t`, and `t` is reduced to `0` after all iterations of the loop have finished.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `test_cases` will contain as many tuples as the initial value of `t`. Each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, which are derived from the corresponding lines in the `data` list. The variable `idx` will be increased by twice the number of iterations (since it increments by 2 with each iteration), and `t` will be set to 0.
