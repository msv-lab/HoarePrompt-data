Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that is not empty, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of all unique `(a % x, a % y)` pairs from the original `arr`, `count` is the sum of the frequencies of pairs `(rx, ry)` found in `freq`, where `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is the last unique pair processed in `arr`, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`.**

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the given code has been executed. The loop has processed all elements in `arr`, making it an empty list. The `freq` dictionary contains the frequency of all unique `(a % x, a % y)` pairs from the original `arr`. The `count` variable holds the sum of the frequencies of pairs `(rx, ry)` found in `freq`. The `current_pair` variable holds the last unique pair processed in `arr`. Lastly, the `results` list contains the final value of `count`.
