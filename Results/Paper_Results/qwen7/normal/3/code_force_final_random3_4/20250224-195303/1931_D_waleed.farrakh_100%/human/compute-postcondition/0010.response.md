Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`.
   - `idx` is `idx + 2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, it needs to be adjusted.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be decremented by 1 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`test_cases` is a list containing one tuple (n, x, y, arr), `idx` is `idx + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`**
