Output State: **`n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` contains at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `rx` is (-`a` % `x` + `x`) % `x`, `ry` is `a` % `y`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a % y` to `ry`. The value of `ry` is dependent on the value of `a` and `y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
