Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing one tuple (n, x, y, arr), `idx` is `idx + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer from `data[idx].split()`, `x` is an integer from `data[idx].split()`, `y` is an integer from `data[idx].split()`**.

This means that the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the integer values from the split of `data[idx]`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `idx`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
