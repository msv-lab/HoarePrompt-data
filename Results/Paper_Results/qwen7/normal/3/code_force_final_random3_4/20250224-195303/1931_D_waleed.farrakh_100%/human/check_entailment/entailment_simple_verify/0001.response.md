### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `freq` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
   - `count` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Through Array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, the program calculates:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This ensures that `rx` is always non-negative and within the range `[0, x-1]`.
     - `ry = a % y`: This calculates the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.

3. **Frequency Dictionary Update**:
   - The program checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` already exists in the `freq` dictionary.
   - If it does, the count of this pair is added to `count`.
   - The current pair `(a % x, a % y)` is updated in the `freq` dictionary.

4. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, the count of beautiful pairs is appended to `results`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the total number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`, and appends them to `test_cases`.

2. **Calling `func_1`**:
   - The program calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and collects the results.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input from stdin and splitting it into individual test cases.

2. **Computation of Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The logic for determining beautiful pairs is correct. A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x`.
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y`.
   - The program uses modular arithmetic to efficiently check these conditions:
     - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) translates to \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
     - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) translates to \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

3. **Frequency Dictionary Usage**:
   - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to count occurrences of pairs \((a \% x, a \% y)\). This helps in quickly finding pairs that satisfy the conditions for being beautiful.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the number of beautiful pairs for each test case correctly.

### Annotations Analysis

The annotations provided are consistent with the program's behavior. They correctly describe the state of the program at key points, confirming that the program is processing each test case correctly and updating the frequency dictionary as intended.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. There are no apparent errors in the code that would lead to incorrect results based on the problem constraints.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
