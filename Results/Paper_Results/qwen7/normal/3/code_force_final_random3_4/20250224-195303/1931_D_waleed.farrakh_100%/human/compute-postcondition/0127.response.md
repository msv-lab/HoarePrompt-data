Output State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `arr` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` encountered during the loop, `count` is the total sum of frequencies of pairs `(rx, ry)` where `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is `a % y` for each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.**

Explanation:
- The line `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`.
- The variables `arr`, `freq`, and `count` retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
- The variable `n` and `x` and `y` are no longer relevant since they were part of the loop's context and are not used outside of it.
- The value of `results` is updated to include the current `count` after the loop has processed all elements in `arr` and updated `freq` and `count` accordingly.
