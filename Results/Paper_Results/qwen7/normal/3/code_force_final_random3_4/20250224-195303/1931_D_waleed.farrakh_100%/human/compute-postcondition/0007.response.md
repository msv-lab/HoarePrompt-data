Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `arr` by mapping the `int` function over the elements obtained from splitting `data[idx + 1]`. However, since `data[idx + 1]` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify the exact values in `arr`. We only know that `arr` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx + 1]`. All other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
