Postcondition: `a` is the next element in `arr`, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` contains at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `rx` is (`a` % `x`), `ry` is `a % y`, and `current_pair` is either updated to `(rx, ry)` if `current_pair` is in `freq`, or set to `(a % x, a % y)` and `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1 if `current_pair` is not in `freq`.
