Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples (with one fewer tuple), `n` is the first element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is an empty list, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `current_pair` is the last unique pair processed in `arr`, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`.**

The code initializes `count` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
