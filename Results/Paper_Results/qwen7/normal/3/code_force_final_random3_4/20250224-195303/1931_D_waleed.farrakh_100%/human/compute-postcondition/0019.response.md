Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing three tuples, `idx` is `idx + 6`, `t` is `t - 2`, `arr` is a list of integers converted from `data[idx + 1].split()`**.

Explanation: Initially, `idx` was `idx + 4`. After executing `idx += 2`, `idx` becomes `idx + 4 + 2`, which simplifies to `idx + 6`. The values of `test_cases`, `t`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
