Output State: **`n` is the first element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is a list with at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `current_pair` is the last unique pair processed in `arr`, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`. `rx` is calculated as (-`n` % `x` + `x`) % `x`.**

In this output state, the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial values as they are part of the first tuple in `test_cases`. The calculation for `rx` is performed using the formula `(-n % x + x) % x`, but since no specific values for `n` and `x` are given, `rx` is expressed in terms of these variables. All other variables retain their initial states.
