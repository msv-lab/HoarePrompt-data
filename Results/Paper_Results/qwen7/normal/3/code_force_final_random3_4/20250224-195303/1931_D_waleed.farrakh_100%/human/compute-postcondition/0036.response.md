Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that is not empty, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the remaining elements of the fourth element of the first tuple in `test_cases` after removing the first element, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `current_pair` (which is `(a % x, a % y)`) assigned the value `1`, `current_pair` is updated to `(a % x, a % y)`, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged, where `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is `a % y`.**

Explanation: The code `freq[current_pair] = 1` adds a new entry to the dictionary `freq` with the key `current_pair` set to `1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
