Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that is not empty, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the remaining elements of the fourth element of the first tuple in `test_cases` after removing the first element, `freq` is a dictionary, `current_pair` is `a % x, a % y`, `count` is updated by adding the value of `freq[rx, ry]` to its current value, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `a` is the next element in `arr`, `ry` is `a % y`, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.**

Explanation: The line `count += freq[rx, ry]` increments the value of `count` by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is a key in the dictionary `freq`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
