Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user.
   - After the execution of the if-else block, `m` satisfies one of the following conditions:
     - `m` is less than both `a` and `b`.
     - `m` is either less than `a` and greater than `b`, or `m` is less than `b` and greater than `a`, or `m` is less than `a` or greater than or equal to `b`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `t`. Therefore, `t` remains the same.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 1.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are not part of the loop head, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user, and after the execution of the if-else block, `m` satisfies one of the following conditions:
- `m` is less than both `a` and `b`.
- `m` is either less than `a` and greater than `b`, or `m` is less than `b` and greater than `a`, or `m` is less than `a` or greater than or equal to `b`.**
