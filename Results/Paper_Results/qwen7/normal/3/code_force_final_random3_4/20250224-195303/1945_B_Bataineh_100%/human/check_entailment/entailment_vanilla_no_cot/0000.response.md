Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has some logical flaws and does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The current logic does not properly handle all edge cases where the intervals of `a` and `b` overlap in a way that maximizes the number of simultaneous fireworks.

2. **Simplified Calculation**: The current approach simplifies the problem too much and does not consider the actual pattern of overlaps and launches over time.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem accurately, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. We also need to account for the visibility period `m`.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the LCM of a and b
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks from each installation within the LCM interval
        num_fireworks_a = (lcm_ab - 1) // a + 1
        num_fireworks_b = (lcm_ab - 1) // b + 1
        
        # Calculate the number of overlapping fireworks
        overlap = (lcm_ab - 1) // lcm_ab + 1
        
        # Calculate the total number of fireworks visible at the same time
        max_visible = num_fireworks_a + num_fireworks_b - overlap
        
        # Ensure the result is within the bounds
        max_visible = min(max_visible, (m // a) + (m // b) + 1)
        
        print(max_visible)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution calculates the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determines the number of fireworks launched by each installation within that interval. It also accounts for the overlapping fireworks and ensures the result is within the bounds of the visibility period `m`.
