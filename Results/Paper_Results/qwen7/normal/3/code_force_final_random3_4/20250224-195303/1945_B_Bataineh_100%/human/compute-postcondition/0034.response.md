Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user.

We need to evaluate the expression `2 + m // b`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2, but it does not affect the expression `2 + m // b`.
2. `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user. Since their specific values are not provided, we cannot determine their exact values.
3. The expression `m // b` performs integer division, which means it returns the quotient of `m` divided by `b`, discarding any remainder.
4. Adding 2 to the result of `m // b` gives us the final value to be printed.

Since the values of `m` and `b` are unknown, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 + m // b (where m and b are integers entered by the user)**
