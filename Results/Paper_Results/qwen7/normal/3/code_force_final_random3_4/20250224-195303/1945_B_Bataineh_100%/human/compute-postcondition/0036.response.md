Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a number greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user.

The print statement is:
```python
print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

Here, `m // a` and `m // b` perform integer division of `m` by `a` and `m` by `b`, respectively. The result of these divisions is then added together, and 2 is added to the sum.

Since `a`, `b`, and `m` are user inputs, their exact values are unknown. Therefore, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **(m // a) + (m // b) + 2**
