Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The variable `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 is still valid. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` depend on the user's input, but they are guaranteed to be integers.
