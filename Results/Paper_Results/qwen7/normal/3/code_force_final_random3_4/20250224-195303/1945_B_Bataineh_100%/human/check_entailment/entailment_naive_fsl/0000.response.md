Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the general case correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` is greater than 1. In such cases, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously would be higher than the current logic suggests.

For example, consider the input `(a=6, b=12, m=4)`:
- The first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes.
- The second installation launches fireworks every 12 minutes.
- Each firework is visible for 5 minutes.

The GCD of 6 and 12 is 6. Therefore, the second installation will launch fireworks at multiples of 12, which are also multiples of 6. This means that the second installation will launch fireworks at 12, 24, 36, etc., which are also the times when the first installation launches fireworks. 

Thus, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously would be 3 (one from the first installation and two from the second installation, since they overlap for the first two launches). However, the program incorrectly calculates this as 2 + `m // b` or 2 + `m // a`, depending on the comparison, which does not account for the overlapping launches due to the GCD.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then determine how many fireworks can be visible simultaneously within the visibility period `m`.
