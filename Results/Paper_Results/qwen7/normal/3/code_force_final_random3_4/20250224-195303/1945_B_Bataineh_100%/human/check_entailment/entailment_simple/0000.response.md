Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
3. The logic inside the if-else block checks different conditions to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - If `m < a` and `m < b`, it prints `2`, which is correct because the fireworks from both installations will overlap for at most 2 launches.
   - If `m < a` and `m > b`, it calculates `2 + m // b`. This is correct because the first installation will have `m // b` launches, and the second installation will have `1` additional launch overlapping with the first one.
   - If `m < b` and `m > a`, it calculates `2 + m // a`. This is also correct because the second installation will have `m // a` launches, and the first installation will have `1` additional launch overlapping with the second one.
   - If neither of the above conditions holds, it calculates `m // a + m // b + 2`. This is correct because both installations will have `m // a` and `m // b` launches respectively, and there will be `2` additional overlapping launches.
4. The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.

Given the logic and the conditions checked, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
