Output State: **`d` is a dictionary containing the key `i` with the value 1; `pl` is a list containing the element `i`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `i` is already a key in the dictionary `d` with the value 1, the list `pl` is updated to include `i`. The dictionary `d` remains unchanged except for the fact that `i` is confirmed to be a key.
