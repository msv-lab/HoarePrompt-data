Output State: **`d` is a dictionary and `pl` is a list; `pl` contains the next element of `i`; if `i` was not in `d`, it is now in `d` with a value of 1, otherwise its value is incremented by 1.**

This means that the list `pl` has appended the current value of `i`, and depending on whether `i` was already a key in the dictionary `d`, it either got added with a value of 1 or its existing value was incremented by 1. The variable `i` itself is updated to the next element in `palka`.
