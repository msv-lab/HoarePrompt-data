Output State: **`palka` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1, and `pl` is a list containing the next element in `palka`.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Since `d[i]` was previously set to 1 if it was `None`, or incremented by 1 if it had a previous value, the new value of `d[i]` will be 2 if it was 1 before, or the previous value plus 1. The other variables (`palka`, `i`, and `pl`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
