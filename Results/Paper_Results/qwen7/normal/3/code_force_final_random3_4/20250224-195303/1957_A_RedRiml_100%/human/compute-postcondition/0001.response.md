State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer**, `_` is a dummy variable initialized to 0.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `_` (a dummy variable) and `w`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `w` is greater than 0.
3. The value of `t` (which is between 1 and 100) does not affect the loop's execution condition.
4. The dummy variable `_` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `w` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
