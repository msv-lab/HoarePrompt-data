The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `t` indicating the number of sticks, followed by `t` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. It calculates and prints the total number of shapes that can be formed, where each shape requires at least three sticks of the same length. The final state of the program is the output of the total number of such shapes for each test case.
