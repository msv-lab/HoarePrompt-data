Output State: **`d[i]` is incremented by 1, `palka` has at least one element, and `d.get(i)` is not None.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Since the precondition states that `d.get(i)` is not None, it means that `i` is a key in dictionary `d`. The value of `d[i]` is incremented, but the exact value before incrementation is not specified, so we only know it was a value that was not None. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged, so `palka` still has at least one element and `d.get(i)` remains not None.
