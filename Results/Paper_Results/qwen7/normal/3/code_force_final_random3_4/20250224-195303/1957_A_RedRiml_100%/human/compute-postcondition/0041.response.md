Output State: **`shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code `shapes += d[j] // 3` increments the value of `shapes` by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3. The other variables (`palka`, `pl`, and `d[j]`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
