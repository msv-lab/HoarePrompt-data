Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, w is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(w):
    ln = int(input())
    palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pl = []
    d = {}
    for i in palka:
        if d.get(i) == None:
            d[i] = 1
        else:
            d[i] += 1
        if i not in pl:
            pl.append(i)
    shapes = 0
    for j in pl:
        if d[j] >= 3:
            shapes += d[j] // 3
    print(shapes)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `shapes` is increased by the total count of each element in `palka` divided by 3, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, and the count of each element in `d` is greater than or equal to 3 after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `palka` is stored, and `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered, with all elements that do not satisfy `d[j] >= 3` removed from `pl`.

In simpler terms, `shapes` will be the total number of times the condition `d[j] >= 3` is met across all unique elements in `palka`, divided by 3, summed up. The dictionary `d` and the list `pl` will only contain elements that meet the condition `d[j] >= 3`, and `pl` will reflect the order in which these elements were first encountered in `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The value of `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
