Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list of integers, `d` is a dictionary where each key `i` from `palka` has its corresponding value incremented by 1 if the key was already present, otherwise the key is added with a value of 1.**

In more detail:
- The list `palka` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
- The dictionary `d` is updated such that for each integer `i` in `palka`, if `i` is already a key in `d`, its corresponding value is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `d`, it is added with a value of 1.
