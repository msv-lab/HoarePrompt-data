Output State: **`shapes` is increased by `d[2] // 3`, `j` is 2**.

Given the initial state where if `pl` contains the value `2`, then `j` is `2` and `pl` must contain the value `2`, the code `shapes += d[j] // 3` updates the value of `shapes` by adding `d[2] // 3` to its current value. Since `j` is set to `2`, the expression `d[j]` is equivalent to `d[2]`. Therefore, `shapes` is increased by `d[2] // 3`. The value of `j` remains `2` as it is not reassigned in the given code snippet.
