Output State: **`possible` is either True or False, `t` is `k - 1`, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes user input, strips any leading and trailing whitespace from it, and assigns the result to `b`. The values of `possible` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state of `a` as the input string after stripping whitespace is not relevant since `b` is now the input string after stripping whitespace.
