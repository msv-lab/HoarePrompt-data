Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n)` statement. This means the variables `i` and `n` are the ones that need to be adjusted.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + t`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`.

3. **Determine the changes for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `n + t + 1`.
   - `n` must remain the same as it is the upper bound of the range and does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `possible` depends on the condition `c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]`. Since `i` will be incremented, we need to check the new value of `c[i+1]` to determine the new value of `possible`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be `n + t + 1`.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `possible` will be determined by the condition `c[i+1] == a[i+1] or c[i+1] == b[i+1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n + t + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `possible` is `True` if `c[i+1]` is either equal to `a[i+1]` or `b[i+1]`. If `c[i+1]` is not equal to `a[i+1]` or `b[i+1]`, `possible` remains `False`.**
