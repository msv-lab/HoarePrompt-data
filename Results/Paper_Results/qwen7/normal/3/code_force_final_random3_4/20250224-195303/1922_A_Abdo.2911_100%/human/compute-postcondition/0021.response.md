Output State: **`possible` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, the elements at index `i` of arrays `a` and `b` are not equal, and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `possible = True` sets the variable `possible` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, the elements at index `i` of arrays `a` and `b`, and `c[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
