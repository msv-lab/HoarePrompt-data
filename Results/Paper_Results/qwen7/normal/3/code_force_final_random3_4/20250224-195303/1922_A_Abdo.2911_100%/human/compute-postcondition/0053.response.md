Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop has executed all iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n-1`.
- The value of `possible` is `True`.
- If at any point during the loop execution, the condition `c[i] != a[i]` was met without `c[i]` being equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` would be set to `True` and the loop would break.
- If the loop completes without setting `possible` to `True`, it remains `False`.

Given this information, since the loop has completed all iterations and `possible` is explicitly stated to be `True`, the `print('YES')` statement will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
