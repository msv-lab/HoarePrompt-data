Postcondition: `i` is `n + t + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is `True` if `c[i+1]` is equal to `a[i+1]` or `b[i+1]`, and `possible` remains `False` if `c[i+1]` is not equal to `a[i+1]` or `b[i+1]`. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.
