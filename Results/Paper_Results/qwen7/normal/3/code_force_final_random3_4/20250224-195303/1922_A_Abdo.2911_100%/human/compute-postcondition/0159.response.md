Output State: **`i` is `n + t + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `possible` is `True` if `c[i+1]` is either equal to `a[i+1]` or `b[i+1]`. If `c[i+1]` is not equal to `a[i+1]` or `b[i+1]`, `possible` remains `False`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. In this case, since there is no loop context provided, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `t`, `possible`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
