Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is `t + 1`, and the value of `a[i]` is not equal to the value of `c[i]`; `possible` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or the relationship between `a[i]` and `c[i]`. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged.
