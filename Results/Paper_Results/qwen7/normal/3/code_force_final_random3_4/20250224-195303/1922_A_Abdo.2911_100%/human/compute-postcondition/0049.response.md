Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer. If `c[2]` is equal to `a[2]` or `c[2]` is equal to `b[2]`, the conditions remain unchanged and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `c[2]` is not equal to `a[2]`, then `possible` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
