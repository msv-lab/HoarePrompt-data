Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `n - 1 + t`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and `possible` remains `False` otherwise.
- `c` is an input string from user input, and the current value of `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1 + t`.
3. **Increment of `i`**: In each iteration of the for loop, `i` is incremented by 1 (`i += 1`).

### Adjusting the States:
- **`i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `n - 1 + t + 1 = n + t`.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` does not change within the loop; it remains the same as it was at the start of the loop.
- **`possible`**: The value of `possible` remains unchanged unless there is a specific condition inside the loop that changes it. However, since no such condition is mentioned, `possible` remains `True` if `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and `False` otherwise.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` is `n + t`
- `n` must still be greater than 0
- `possible` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (it is `True` if `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and `False` otherwise)

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n + t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and `possible` remains `False` otherwise.**
