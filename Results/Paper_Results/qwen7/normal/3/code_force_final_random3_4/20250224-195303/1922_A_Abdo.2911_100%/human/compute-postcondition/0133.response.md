Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1 + t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` remains False, `c` is an input string from user input, and the current value of `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the context, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `possible` variable remains False, and the other conditions related to `i`, `n`, `t`, `c`, `a`, and `b` also remain the same as they were in the initial state.
