Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is `t + 1`, and `possible` is True if any character `c[i]` does not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]` for any `i` from 0 to `n-1`; otherwise, `possible` remains False.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has gone through all elements from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `n` remains as `t + 1`, which was its value when the loop started. The variable `possible` will be True if at any point during the loop's execution, a character `c[i]` did not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, leading to the setting of `possible` to True and breaking out of the loop. If no such mismatch was found, `possible` will remain False.
