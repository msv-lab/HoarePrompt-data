Output State: **`possible` is either True or False, `t` is `k - 1`, `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `c` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `c = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to the variable `c`. The values of `possible`, `t`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
