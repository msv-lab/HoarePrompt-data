Output State: **`possible` is `True`, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `a[0]` is equal to the current value of `b[0]`. The condition `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `possible = True` sets the variable `possible` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `a[0]`, `b[0]`, and the condition `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
