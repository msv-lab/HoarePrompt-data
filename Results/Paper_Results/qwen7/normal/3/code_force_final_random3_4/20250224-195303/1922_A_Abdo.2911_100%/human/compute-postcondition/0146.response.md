Postcondition: `i` is `n + t`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` remains `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]`, `possible` remains `True`. If there is no else part, `possible` remains `False` otherwise.
