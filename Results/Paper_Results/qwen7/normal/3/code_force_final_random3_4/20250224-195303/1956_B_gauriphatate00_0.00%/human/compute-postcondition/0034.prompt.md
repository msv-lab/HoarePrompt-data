You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, representing the number of cards in your and Nene's hands. The list a is a list of n integers, where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the list a at most 2 times, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, so `t` is now 0. `idx` is `idx + n` from the last iteration, where `n` is `int(data[idx])`. `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`. `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, with a total of `t` elements. `data` remains unchanged throughout the process.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `t` is 0 because all iterations are done. `idx` points to the position right after the last list `a` was processed. `a` contains integers from the current position of `idx` to `idx + n`. `results` is a list of function outputs from each iteration of the loop, and `data` stays as it was initially.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, so `t` is now 0. `idx` is pointing to the position right after the last list `a` was processed. `a` contains integers from the current position of `idx` to `idx + n`. `results` is a list of function outputs from each iteration of the loop, with a total of `t` elements (which is 3 in this case). `data` remains unchanged throughout the process.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by t sets of data. Each set includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), representing the number of cards, and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each integer appears at most twice. The function returns a result for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to pair the cards in such a way that each pair consists of two cards with the same integer.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
