Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining the maximum number of points you can get in a card game against Nene, who plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. Each player starts with \( n \) cards, and the goal is to score points by placing a card on the table when there is already a card with the same number on it.

2. **Analyzing Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the minimum value between the number of pairs of integers in the list `a` that occur exactly twice (`pairs`) and half the number of cards (`n // 2`).
   - This is crucial because Nene will always try to maximize her score by pairing her cards with those on the table. If there are fewer than `n // 2` pairs, you can't guarantee getting any points even if you play optimally. However, if there are at least `n // 2` pairs, you can ensure at least `n // 2` points by playing optimally.

3. **Analyzing Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input data for multiple test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - The logic is sound: it correctly parses the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

4. **Verification**:
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the functions. For instance, in the first test case, the output is `1`, which matches the expected result based on the described game dynamics.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the number of pairs and ensures that the returned value is the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
