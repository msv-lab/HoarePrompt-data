Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder) and `t`. The variable `t` is used as the range parameter, indicating how many times the loop will execute.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop**: We know that `idx` is 2, `t` is an integer from the list `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting an input string using spaces, and `results` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute `t` times. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer. The other variables (`idx`, `data`, and `results`) do not directly affect the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being a positive integer.

**State:**
**`idx` is 2, `t` must be a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `results` is an empty list**
