Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + (data[idx - data[idx]])`, `n` is `data[idx - data[idx]]`, `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`, `t` is `t - 1**.

Explanation:
- The variable `results` appends the return value of `func_1(n, a)` to itself. This means that `results` now contains one more element, which is the return value of the function call `func_1(n, a)`.
- The variables `data`, `idx`, `n`, `a`, and `t` retain their previous values except that `idx` is updated to `idx + (data[idx - data[idx]])` and `t` is decremented by 1.
