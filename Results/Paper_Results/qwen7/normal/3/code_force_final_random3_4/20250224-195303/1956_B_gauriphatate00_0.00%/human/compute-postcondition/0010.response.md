Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is idx + n, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - n]`, `a` is a list of integers starting from `data[idx - n]` and having length `n`.**

Explanation: Initially, `idx` is incremented by 1, and `n` is set to the integer value of `data[idx]`. Then, `idx` is incremented by `n`. This means `idx` now points to the position `idx - n + n`, which simplifies to `idx - n + n`, but since `idx` was already `idx + 1` before the second increment, it effectively moves `idx` to `idx + n`. The value of `n` remains the integer value of `data[idx - n]`, and the list `a` still starts from `data[idx - n]` and has a length of `n`.
