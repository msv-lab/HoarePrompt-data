Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer from the list `data`, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` was initially set to 1. After executing `idx += 1`, the value of `idx` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `t` and `data` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
