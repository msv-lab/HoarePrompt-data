Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved here are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `results` is a non-empty list. This means that at the start of each iteration, `results` must still be a non-empty list.

3. **Adjust the States**: At the end of the previous iteration, `results` was a non-empty list. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still be a non-empty list. Additionally, `result` will be set to the next element in the list during the current iteration.

### Final State:

State: **`results` must still be a non-empty list, and `result` will be set to the next element in the list.**

So, the final state is:

```
State: **results must still be a non-empty list, and result will be set to the next element in the list.**
```
