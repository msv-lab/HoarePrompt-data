Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) representing the number of test cases, followed by \( t \) sets of data. Each set includes an integer \( n \) representing the number of cards, and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers where each integer appears at most twice. For each test case, the function calls another function `func_1(n, a)` to determine if it is possible to pair the cards such that each pair consists of two cards with the same integer. The function then prints the result for each test case.**
