Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop variable is `_` (which is typically an underscore when the loop variable is not used), and the loop condition depends on the variable `t`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `data` is unchanged.
   - `idx` is updated to `idx + (data[idx - data[idx]])`.
   - `n` is updated to `data[idx - data[idx]]`.
   - `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`.
   - `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`.
   - `t` is decremented by 1 (`t = t - 1`).

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, it needs to be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.
   - All other variables (`data`, `idx`, `n`, `a`, `results`) remain unchanged as per the loop head.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, which must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + (data[idx - data[idx]])`, `n` is `data[idx - data[idx]]`, `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`, `t` is `t - 1 and must be greater than 1**
