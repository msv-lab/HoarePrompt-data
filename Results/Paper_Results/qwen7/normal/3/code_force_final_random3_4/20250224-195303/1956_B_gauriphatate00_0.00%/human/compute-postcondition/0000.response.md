Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`, representing the number of test cases and the input reading method.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the `sys.stdin.read` function, which reads the entire input from standard input as a single string. This does not change the value of `t` or any other variables. Therefore, the only change is in how the input is read, which is now done using `sys.stdin.read`.
