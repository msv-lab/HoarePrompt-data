Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `n` is `int(data[idx])`, `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`, `t` is `t - 1 and must be greater than 1**.

Explanation:
- `idx` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[idx])`.
- `a` is updated to be a list of integers created by applying the `int` function to each element in the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`.
- `results` gains an additional element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`.
- `t` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than 1.
