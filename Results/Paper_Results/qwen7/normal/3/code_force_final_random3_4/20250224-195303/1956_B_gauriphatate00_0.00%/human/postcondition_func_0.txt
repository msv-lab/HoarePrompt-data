The function accepts an integer `n` representing half the number of cards and a list `a` of integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive). It calculates the minimum value between the number of pairs of integers in list `a` that occur exactly twice and half the number of cards (`n // 2`). The function returns this minimum value.
