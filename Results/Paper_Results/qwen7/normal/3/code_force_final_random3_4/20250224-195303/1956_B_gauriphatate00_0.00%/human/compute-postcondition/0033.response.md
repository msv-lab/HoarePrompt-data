Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by t sets of data. Each set includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), representing the number of cards, and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each integer appears at most twice. The function returns a result for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to pair the cards in such a way that each pair consists of two cards with the same integer.**

This functionality describes a function that iterates over multiple test cases, each involving a specified number of cards with specific values, and determines if it's possible to pair the cards so that each pair has the same integer value.
