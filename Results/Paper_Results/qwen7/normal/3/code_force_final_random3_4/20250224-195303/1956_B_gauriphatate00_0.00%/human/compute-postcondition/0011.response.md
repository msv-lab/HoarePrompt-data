Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is idx + n, `n` is the integer value of data[idx - n], `a` is a list of integers starting from data[idx - n] and having length n, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, a)` to the list `results`. The values of `data`, `idx`, `n`, and `a` are updated according to their definitions in the initial state. The `results` list now contains one more element, which is the return value of the function `func_1` applied to `n` and `a`.
