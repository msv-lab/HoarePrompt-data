Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get in the described card game. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of pairs of identical cards in your hand using a `Counter`.
   - It then returns the minimum of this number of pairs and half the number of turns (`n // 2`). This is because Nene will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours, and having more than `n // 2` pairs means Nene can force you to lose all but one of those pairs.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input data from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It uses the `input` method to read all input at once, which is efficient for large inputs.
   - It then iterates over each test case, extracts the necessary values (`n` and `a`), and calls `func_1` to compute the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the provided solution accurately computes the maximum number of points you can get when playing optimally against Nene. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
