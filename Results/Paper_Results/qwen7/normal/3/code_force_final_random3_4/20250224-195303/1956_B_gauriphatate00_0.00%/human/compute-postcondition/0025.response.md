Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, so `t` is now 0. `idx` is `idx + n` from the last iteration, where `n` is `int(data[idx])`. `a` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` over the slice of `data` from `idx` to `idx + n`. `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, with a total of `t` elements. `data` remains unchanged throughout the process.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `t` is 0 because all iterations are done. `idx` points to the position right after the last list `a` was processed. `a` contains integers from the current position of `idx` to `idx + n`. `results` is a list of function outputs from each iteration of the loop, and `data` stays as it was initially.
