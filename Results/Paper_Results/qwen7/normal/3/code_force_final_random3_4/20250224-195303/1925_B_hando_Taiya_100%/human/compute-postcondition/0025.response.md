Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is a divisor of `x` plus 2, `isqrt(x) + 1` must be a positive integer, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum value between its current value and `i`. Since `i` is a divisor of `x` plus 2, and `isqrt(x) + 1` must be a positive integer, these conditions remain unchanged. The value of `total` remains 0, and the updated value of `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`.
