Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `isqrt(x) + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `isqrt(x) + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is a divisor of `x`
   - `isqrt(x) + 1` must be a positive integer
   - `ans` is the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `x // i`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be less than `isqrt(x) + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `total` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so if the previous value of `i` was `k`, the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - `isqrt(x) + 1` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` remains unchanged because it is determined based on the previous values of `i` and `x // i`, and the loop body does not change `ans` unless a new maximum is found.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is a divisor of `x` plus 1, `isqrt(x) + 1` must be a positive integer, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `x // i`**.

To express this more concretely:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is a divisor of `x` plus 1, `isqrt(x) + 1` must be a positive integer, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `x // (i - 1)`**.
