Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where for each test case, it accepts three integers: t (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), x (such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8), and n (such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x). It processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on the values of t, x, and n.**

Given the constraints and the implied structure, the function likely iterates over a range defined by `t` and checks conditions involving `x` and `n`, returning various results based on those conditions. However, without the exact logic, the focus here is on the parameters and the nature of their usage within the function.
