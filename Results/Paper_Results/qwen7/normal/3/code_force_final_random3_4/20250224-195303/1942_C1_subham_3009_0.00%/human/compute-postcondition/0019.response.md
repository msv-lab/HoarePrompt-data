Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer.
- `x` is an integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers where each element is the integer conversion of the corresponding element in the original input string split by spaces.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(x - 2)
```

Given the initial state, we know the value of `x` but it is not explicitly stated. Since no specific value for `x` is provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `x - 2`. However, we can describe the expression that will be printed.

Output: **x - 2**
