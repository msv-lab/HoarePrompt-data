Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer; `arr` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the corresponding element in the input string split by spaces, and `arr` is now a list of integers where each element is the integer conversion of the corresponding element in the original input string split by spaces.**

This means that the list `arr` has been updated to contain integers instead of strings, based on the input string split by spaces. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.
