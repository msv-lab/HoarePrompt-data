Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate a string with exactly `n` special characters as defined in the problem description. Specifically, the string generated by the program does not necessarily have exactly `n` special characters. For example, consider the case when `n = 7`. The program generates the string `'110110110'`, which has 4 special characters, not 7. Additionally, the program does not handle the case when `n` is odd, which is explicitly mentioned in the problem description. The program prints 'NO' for odd `n`, but it should still attempt to generate a valid string if possible.
