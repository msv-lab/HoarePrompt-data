Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an even integer, and `s` is '110110...110' (repeated `n//2` times). If the length of `s` is less than 200, no changes are made. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, no changes are made as well since the condition does not specify any change in `t` or `s` when the length is 200 or more.
