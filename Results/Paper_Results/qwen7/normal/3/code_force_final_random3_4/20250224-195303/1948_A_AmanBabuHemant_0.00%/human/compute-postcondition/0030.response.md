Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input from the user, `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times with a length of either less than 200 or exactly 200.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` to be a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The length of `s` will be either less than 200 or exactly 200, depending on the value of `n`.
