Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` and `n`. For each test case, it checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by `s`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
