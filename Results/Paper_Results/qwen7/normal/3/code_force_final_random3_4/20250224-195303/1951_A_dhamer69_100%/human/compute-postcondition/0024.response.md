Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, and `n` is not equal to 2, and `count_1` is even, and either `s.count('11') != 1` or `count_1 != 2`.
