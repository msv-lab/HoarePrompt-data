Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a string indicating whether the start and end directory names are valid (i.e., start <= end and both do not have leading zeros).**

Given the constraints, the function should check if the `start` and `end` directory names satisfy the conditions of being valid (i.e., start is less than or equal to end and neither has leading zeros). However, since the function definition does not include any parameters, the description focuses on the expected input conditions and the expected return value based on those conditions.
