Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Determine the current state of the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `t` is an input integer.
3. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the current state:
- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is an input integer.

Since the loop condition depends solely on `t`, and we need `t` to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `t` meets this condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0**
