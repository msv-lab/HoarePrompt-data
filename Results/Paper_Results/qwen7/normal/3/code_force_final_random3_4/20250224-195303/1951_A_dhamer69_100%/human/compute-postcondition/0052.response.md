Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is now an input string from the user, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`.**

Explanation: The initial state had `t` greater than 1, `n` as an input integer, and `s` as an input string. The code `s = input()` updates the value of `s` to be the new input string from the user. The count of '1' in `s` (stored in `count_1`) remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
