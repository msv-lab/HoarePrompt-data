### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is the relevant part of the program to evaluate based on the problem description. The assessment accurately describes the steps taken by the function and confirms that each step logically follows from the problem statement. 

However, the provided `func` function is not related to the problem description and does not need to be evaluated for correctness in this context. The original assessment does not mention the `func` function at all, which is appropriate since it is not part of the problem being described.

Given that the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is correctly implemented according to the problem description, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
