Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`.**

The code counts the occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s` and assigns the result to the variable `count_1`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
