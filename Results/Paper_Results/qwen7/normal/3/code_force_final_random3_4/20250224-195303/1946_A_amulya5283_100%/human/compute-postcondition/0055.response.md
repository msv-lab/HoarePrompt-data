The loop condition is `t > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is `t` is 0. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `-1`, `res` contains the total count of elements in the list `a` starting from index `mdx` (which is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`) that are equal to `a[mdx]`. The variable `a` will retain its values from the initial state.**
