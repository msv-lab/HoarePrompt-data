Output State: **`mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `n` is an integer and `n` is not equal to 1, and `mdx < n`; `res` is `res + 1`, `a` is a list of integers, and the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `mdx`, `n`, `a`, and the condition `mdx < n` and the value of `a[mdx]` remain the same.
