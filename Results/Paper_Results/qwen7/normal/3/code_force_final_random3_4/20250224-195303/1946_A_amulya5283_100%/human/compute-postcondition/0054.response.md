Postcondition: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `-1`, `res` contains the total count of elements in the list `a` starting from index `mdx` (which is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`) that are equal to `a[mdx]`. The variable `a` will retain its values from the initial state.
