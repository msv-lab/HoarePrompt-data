Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is the count of elements in the list `a` starting from index `mdx` (which is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`) that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
- After the loop finishes, the variable `i` will be `-1` because the loop runs from `mdx` to `n-1`.

The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is the count of elements in the list `a` starting from the index `mdx` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

Therefore, the output will be the count of elements in the list `a` starting from the index `mdx` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

Output: **res (where res is the count of elements in the list a starting from index mdx that are equal to a[mdx])**
