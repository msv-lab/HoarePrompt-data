Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `mdx` to `n` (inclusive), so the loop condition is `i >= mdx` and `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `res` is 1 if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise `res` remains 0
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input
   - `mdx` is less than or equal to `n - 1`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `mdx` to `n`, the current value of `i` is `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented and checked against the condition `i >= mdx` and `i < n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be decremented by 1 in the next iteration, making it `n - 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `n - 2`
   - `res` will remain unchanged unless the condition inside the loop changes it, but since no such change is mentioned, it stays as it is.

6. **Final state**:
   - `t` remains 0
   - `n` remains the same
   - `mdx` remains the same
   - `i` is now `n - 2`
   - `res` remains the same (1 if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise 0)
   - `a` remains the same

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `res` is 1 if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise `res` remains 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, and `mdx` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.**
