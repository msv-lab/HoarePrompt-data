The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list `a` and then counts the occurrences of the middle element (or the element just after the middle if `n` is even) in the sorted list. It prints the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function outputs nothing further and ends.
