Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `res` is `res + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, and `mdx` is less than or equal to `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `i` was previously `n - 1`, after decrementing `i` by 1, its new value is `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the condition that `mdx` is less than or equal to `n - 1` is now `mdx` is less than or equal to `n - 2`.
