Output State: **`mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `res` is `res + 1`, `n` is an integer and `n` is not equal to 1, and `mdx < n`.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is incremented by 1. The values of `mdx`, `i`, `n`, and the condition `mdx < n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
