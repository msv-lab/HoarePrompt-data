Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `mdx`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to `-1`.
   - The variable `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - For the loop `for i in range(mdx, n)` to execute, `i` must be within the range defined by `mdx` to `n-1`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to `-1`, it is not yet within the range `[mdx, n)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `mdx` or any value within the range `[mdx, n)`.
   - We need to ensure that `mdx` is correctly calculated based on the value of `n`.

4. **Final state**:
   - `t` is `t - 1` and remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` is an input integer and remains unchanged.
   - `mdx` must be calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `i` must be set to `mdx` or any value within the range `[mdx, n)`.
   - `res` is `0` and remains unchanged.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user and remains unchanged.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx`, `res` is `0`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user**.
