Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This sets `t` to be a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The other variables (`n` and `a`) remain in their initial state as they are not affected by this line of code.
