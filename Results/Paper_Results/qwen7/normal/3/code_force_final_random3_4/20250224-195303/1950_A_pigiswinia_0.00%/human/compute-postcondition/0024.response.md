Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a`, `b`, `c` are integers from input.
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `i` is `t-1`.
   - The condition `a < b < c` holds true.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(t)`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `t-1`.

3. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `t-1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `t`.
   - Since `i` is currently `t-1`, the next value of `i` would be `t`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `t`.

6. **Conditions to Maintain:**
   - The conditions involving `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` remain the same as they are not affected by the loop itself.

**Final State:**
- `a`, `b`, `c` are integers from input.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is `t`.

State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are integers from input, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `i` is `t`**.
