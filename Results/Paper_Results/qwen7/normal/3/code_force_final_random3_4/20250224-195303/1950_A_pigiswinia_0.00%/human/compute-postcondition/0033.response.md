Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the evaluation of three integers a, b, and c within specific ranges (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9) for each test case where t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) represents the number of test cases.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers a, b, and c, and returns a value for each case without accepting these integers as direct parameters.
