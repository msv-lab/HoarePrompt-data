Output State: **`a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `c` is an integer from input, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `t` being an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive remains unchanged.
