### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Digits**: For each test case, it correctly reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIRS' if this condition is met. This is correct according to the problem statement.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met. However, there is a logical error in the condition. The correct condition for a peak should be `a < b and b > c`. The current condition `a < b > c` will always evaluate to `False` because `b > c` cannot be true if `a < b < c` is true.
5. **Default Case**: If neither condition is met, the program prints 'NONE'. This handles all other cases correctly.

Given that the program incorrectly checks for a peak condition, it will not produce the expected output for some test cases. Specifically, it will fail to identify peaks where `a < b > c` is true but `b > c` is false.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the condition for checking a peak is incorrect. The program will not correctly identify peaks in some cases.

### Final:
**False**
