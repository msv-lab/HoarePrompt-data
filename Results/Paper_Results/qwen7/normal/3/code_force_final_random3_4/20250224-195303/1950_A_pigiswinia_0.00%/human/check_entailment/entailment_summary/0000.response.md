Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIRS' if this condition is true.
4. It also checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is true.
5. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
6. The conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` are correctly implemented to check for a stair and a peak respectively.
7. The program does not have any logical errors based on the provided execution summary and the problem description.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
