Based on the initial state provided:

- `a`, `b`, `c` are integers from input.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is `t-1`.

The `print('STAIRS')` statement will simply print the string 'STAIRS' to the console. Since no specific values for `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, or `i` are given, they do not affect the output of this particular print statement.

Output: **STAIRS**
