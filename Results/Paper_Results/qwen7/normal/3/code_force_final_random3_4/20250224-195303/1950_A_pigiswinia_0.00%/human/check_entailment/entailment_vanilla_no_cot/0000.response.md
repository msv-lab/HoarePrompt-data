Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the problem description. The conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`) are correctly checked, and the appropriate output is printed for each test case. The program handles multiple test cases as specified and outputs the correct results for the given examples.
