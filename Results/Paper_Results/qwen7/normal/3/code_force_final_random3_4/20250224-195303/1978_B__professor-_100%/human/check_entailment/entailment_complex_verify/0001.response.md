### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal `k` such that the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` and the rest at the usual price `a`.
   - We need to consider different scenarios based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It checks the conditions to determine the optimal `k` and calculates the profit accordingly.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** If `b <= a`, the best strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is handled correctly by printing `n * a`.
   - **Case 2:** If `b - a >= n`, the best strategy is to sell all buns at the modified price. This is also handled correctly by printing `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
   - **Case 3:** Otherwise, the code calculates the profit using the formula `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`. This formula accounts for the sum of the arithmetic series for the modified prices and the usual price for the remaining buns.

4. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:
     - **Example 1:** `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
       - Optimal choice: `k = 1` (sell the first bun at 5 coins and the rest at 4 coins).
       - Profit: `5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17` (matches the output).
     - **Example 2:** `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
       - Optimal choice: `k = 5` (sell all buns at 9 coins each).
       - Profit: `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35` (matches the output).
     - **Example 3:** `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
       - Optimal choice: `k = 0` (sell all buns at 10 coins each).
       - Profit: `10 * 10 = 100` (matches the output).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases like `b <= a` and `b - a >= n` correctly.
   - The formula `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)` is derived from the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in the code matches the problem statement and the examples provided.
   - The conditions and formulas used are correct for the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit for each test case based on the provided conditions.
