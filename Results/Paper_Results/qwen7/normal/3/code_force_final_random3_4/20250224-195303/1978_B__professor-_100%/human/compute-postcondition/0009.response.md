Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input, and `b` is less than or equal to `a`.

We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement:
\[ \text{int}((b - a) \times (b - a + 1) // 2 + a \times n) \]

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate \( b - a \):**
   Since \( b \leq a \), \( b - a \) will be a non-positive integer. Let's denote this difference as \( d = b - a \). Therefore, \( d \leq 0 \).

2. **Calculate \( (b - a) \times (b - a + 1) \):**
   This simplifies to \( d \times (d + 1) \). Since \( d \leq 0 \), \( d \times (d + 1) \) will be a non-positive integer. If \( d = 0 \), then \( d \times (d + 1) = 0 \). If \( d < 0 \), then \( d \times (d + 1) \) will be a negative integer.

3. **Divide by 2:**
   Since \( d \times (d + 1) \) is non-positive, dividing it by 2 will still result in a non-positive integer. If \( d = 0 \), then \( \frac{d \times (d + 1)}{2} = 0 \). If \( d < 0 \), then \( \frac{d \times (d + 1)}{2} \) will be a negative integer.

4. **Add \( a \times n \):**
   Since \( a \) and \( n \) are both integers, \( a \times n \) is also an integer. Adding this to the previous result (which is non-positive) will still yield an integer.

5. **Take the integer part:**
   The `int` function will convert the result to an integer, which is already an integer in this case.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[ \text{int}(d \times (d + 1) // 2 + a \times n) \]
Where \( d = b - a \).

Since \( d \leq 0 \), the term \( d \times (d + 1) // 2 \) will be non-positive, and adding \( a \times n \) (which is positive) will give us an integer. The exact value depends on the specific values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( n \).

Output: **int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)**
