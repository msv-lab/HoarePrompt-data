Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, and if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition holds as is. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `b` is adjusted such that the difference between `b` and `a` is either greater than or equal to `n`, or `b` becomes less than or equal to `a`.
