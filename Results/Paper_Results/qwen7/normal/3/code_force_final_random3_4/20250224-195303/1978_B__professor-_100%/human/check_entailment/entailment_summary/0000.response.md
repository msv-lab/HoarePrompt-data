Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input and processes multiple test cases as required.
2. The logic for determining the maximum profit is as follows:
   - If \( b \leq a \), the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - If \( b - a < n \), the optimal strategy is to sell the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price \( a \).
   - If \( b - a \geq n \), the optimal strategy is to sell the first \( n \) buns at the modified prices.
3. The formulas used in the program match the described logic:
   - When \( b \leq a \), the profit is simply \( n \times a \).
   - When \( b - a < n \), the profit is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series for the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns plus the usual price for the remaining buns: \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\).
   - When \( b - a \geq n \), the profit is the sum of the arithmetic series for the first \( n \) buns: \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\).

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program appears to handle all cases correctly according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
