Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable directly involved in the loop condition is `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and is reduced by 1.
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `a` is the second integer input.
   - `b` is the third integer input.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `t` is reduced by 1 at the end of each iteration, `t` will be decreased by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is reduced by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `t` was greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be exactly 1 (since it was reduced by 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0, which means `t` should be set to 1.

5. **Final state**:
   - `t` is now 1 (since it was reduced by 1).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input**.
