Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the function does not change `b`. Otherwise, if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `b` is greater than `a`; otherwise, `b` remains less than or equal to `a`.
