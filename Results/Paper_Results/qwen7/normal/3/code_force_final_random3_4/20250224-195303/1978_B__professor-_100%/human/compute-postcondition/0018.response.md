Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and is reduced by 1, so \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.

We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement:
\[ \text{int}((b - a) \times (b - a + 1) // 2 + a \times n) \]

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `(b - a) \times (b - a + 1) // 2`: This part calculates the sum of the first `(b - a)` integers. The formula for the sum of the first `k` integers is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\), where `k = b - a`.
   - `a \times n`: This part multiplies the integer `a` by the integer `n`.

2. **Combining the Parts**:
   - The entire expression combines these two parts: the sum of the first `(b - a)` integers plus `a` times `n`.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The result is then converted to an integer using `int()`.

Given that `a`, `b`, and `n` are explicitly defined but their specific values are not provided, we can express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)**
