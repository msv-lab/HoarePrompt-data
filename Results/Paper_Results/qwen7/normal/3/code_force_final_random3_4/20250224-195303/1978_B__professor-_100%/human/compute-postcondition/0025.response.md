Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1 (though `t` is not used in the expression, it's part of the initial state).
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `a` is the second integer from the input.
- `b` is the third integer from the input.

The expression to be evaluated is:
\[ \text{int}((b - a) \times (b - a + 1) // 2 + a \times n) \]

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate \( b - a \).
2. Calculate \( b - a + 1 \).
3. Compute the product of \( b - a \) and \( b - a + 1 \).
4. Divide the product by 2 using integer division (`//`), which means the result is rounded down to the nearest whole number.
5. Multiply \( a \) by \( n \).
6. Add the results from steps 4 and 5.
7. Convert the final result to an integer (though it already is an integer due to the use of integer division).

So, if we denote the first integer from the input as \( n \), the second integer as \( a \), and the third integer as \( b \), the expression simplifies to:
\[ \text{int}((b - a) \times (b - a + 1) // 2 + a \times n) \]

This expression calculates the sum of an arithmetic series starting from \( a \) with a common difference of 1, up to \( b \), and then adds \( a \times n \).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)**
