Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `b` is between `a` and `n`. Specifically, the condition `elif b - a >= n:` is not sufficient to cover all scenarios. Consider the following input:

- Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 7`

According to the problem description, Bob should choose `k = 2` to maximize profit. The first two buns are sold at prices 7 and 6, and the remaining three buns are sold at 5 coins each. The total profit would be `7 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 24`.

However, the current implementation calculates the profit as `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)` which results in `int((2 * 7 - 5 + 1) * 5 // 2) = 20`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal choice of `k = 2`.

To fix this, the program needs to evaluate the profit for different values of `k` and choose the maximum. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            current_profit = sum((b - i + 1) for i in range(1, k + 1)) + a * (n - k)
            max_profit = max(max_profit, current_profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This version iterates over all possible values of `k` and calculates the profit for each, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.
