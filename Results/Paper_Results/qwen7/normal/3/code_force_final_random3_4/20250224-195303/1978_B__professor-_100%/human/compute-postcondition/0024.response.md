Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `a` is the second integer from the input
- `b` is the third integer from the input

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
```

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` function:

1. `2 * b`: This multiplies the value of `b` by 2.
2. `2 * b - n + 1`: This subtracts `n` from the result of `2 * b` and then adds 1.
3. `(2 * b - n + 1) * n`: This multiplies the result of the previous step by `n`.
4. `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`: This divides the result of the previous step by 2 using integer division (`//`), which means the result will be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
5. `int(...)`: Since the result of the division is already an integer due to the use of `//`, this function call is redundant but does not change the value.

So, the expression simplifies to calculating the integer part of \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\).

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\).

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)**
