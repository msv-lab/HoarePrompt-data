Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `x` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `y` is the second integer from the input converted to an integer. Regardless of whether `x` is less than `y` or not, the values of `t`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
