Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `x` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `y` is the second integer from the input converted to an integer.

After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be the total number of iterations minus one. Since the loop runs `x` times and `x` is the initial value of `x` provided as input, `i` will be `x - 1`. However, based on the given information, we only know the state after the loop has executed 3 times, meaning `i` is 2. Therefore, it can be inferred that `x` is 4 (since `i` is `x - 1`). 

The values of `t` and `y` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution. Thus, `t` stays within the range 1 to 100, and `y` is the second integer from the input, which is processed and printed during each iteration but does not change outside the loop context.
