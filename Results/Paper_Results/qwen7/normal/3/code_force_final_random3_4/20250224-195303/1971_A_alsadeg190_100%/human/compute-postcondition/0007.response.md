Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer and `x` is greater than 0.
- `y` is replaced by the second integer from the input.

When the `print(y, x)` statement is executed, it will print the values of `y` and `x`.

Since `y` is explicitly stated to be the second integer from the input, and `x` is also an input integer, the output will be the second input integer followed by the first input integer.

Output: **second input integer, first input integer**
