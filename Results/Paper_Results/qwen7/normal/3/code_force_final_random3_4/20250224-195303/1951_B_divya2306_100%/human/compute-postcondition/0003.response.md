State: **`wins` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- The loop condition `range(n)` means that the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
- Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is setting `i` to 0.

The other variables (`wins`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) do not affect the loop's execution directly and can remain as given in the initial state.
