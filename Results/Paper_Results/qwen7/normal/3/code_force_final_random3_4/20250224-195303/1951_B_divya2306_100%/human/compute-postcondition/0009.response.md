Output State: **`wins` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `wins += 1` increments the value of `wins` by 1. Initially, `wins` is 0, so after executing this line, `wins` becomes 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
