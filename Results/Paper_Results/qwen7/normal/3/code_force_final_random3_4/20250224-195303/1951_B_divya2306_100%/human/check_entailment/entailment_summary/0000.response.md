Reasoning:
1. The program should read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it should read `n` and `k`, followed by the list of ratings `a`.
3. The program aims to find the maximum number of wins for cow `k` by either doing nothing or swapping its position.
4. The initial logic in `func_1()` tries to count the number of cows with ratings less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before cow `k` starts playing. This count is stored in `wins`.
5. If `wins` is at least `k`, it means cow `k` can win without any swaps, so it prints `wins - 1`.
6. If `wins` is less than `k`, it considers the effect of swapping cow `k` with a better-rated cow. It calculates `win_with_swap` by counting how many cows with ratings greater than `a[k-1]` are before cow `k` in the list.
7. The final result is determined by comparing `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program appears to follow the logic correctly. It handles the counting of wins and the potential benefit of swapping. The logic seems to align with the problem statement and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
