Output State: **`i` is `win_with_swap`, and `win_with_swap` is equal to `win_with_swap + 1`, and `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`.**

This means that the value of `win_with_swap` has been incremented by 1, and it still must be less than `k - 1`. The value of `i` remains the same as `win_with_swap` before the increment.
