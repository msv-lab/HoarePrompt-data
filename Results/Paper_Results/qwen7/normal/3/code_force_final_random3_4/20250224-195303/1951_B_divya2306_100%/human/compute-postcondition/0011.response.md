Output State: **`wins` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their initial states remain unchanged.
