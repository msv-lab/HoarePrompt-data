Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes values for `t`, `n`, and `m` where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The function does not return any specific value but rather processes these inputs according to the given constraints.**
