Reasoning:

1. The program should read the number of test cases, `t`, which is correctly handled by reading `kreker = int(input())`.
2. It then iterates over each test case using a loop from `i in range(kreker)`.
3. Inside the loop, it calls `func_1()`, which is defined to process each test case.
4. In `func_1()`, the program reads `n` and `m` for each test case using `n, m = map(int, input().split())`.
5. The condition `if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)` checks whether the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative. This condition is correct because:
   - If `n` is the total number of moves and `m` is the final number of cubes, the difference `n - m` represents the net number of additions minus removals.
   - For `n - m` to be even and non-negative, it means that the number of additions must equal the number of removals plus some additional additions, which is feasible through the allowed operations (adding or removing exactly one cube per move).
6. If the condition is true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
7. The logic in `func_1()` matches the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
