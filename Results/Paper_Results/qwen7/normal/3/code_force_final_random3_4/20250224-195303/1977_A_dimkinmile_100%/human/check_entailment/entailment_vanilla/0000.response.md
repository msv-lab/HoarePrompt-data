### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic Check**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
     - If `n - m` is even, it means the number of moves to add or remove cubes can be balanced.
     - If `n - m` is non-negative, it means the final number of cubes `m` can be achieved by performing `n` moves.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program logic matches the problem description and handles all the test cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
