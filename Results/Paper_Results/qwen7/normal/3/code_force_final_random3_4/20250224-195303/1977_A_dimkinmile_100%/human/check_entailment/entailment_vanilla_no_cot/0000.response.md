Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The issue lies in the function `func_1()`, where the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is used to check if it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:
- Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
- Therefore, the difference between the number of additions and removals must equal `m`.
- Since each move changes the count by exactly 1, the total difference (`n - m`) must be even for it to be possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

However, the current implementation incorrectly checks if `n - m` is non-negative and even. It should simply check if `n - m` is even, without the non-negativity condition, because the number of additions and removals can balance out to any integer value, positive or negative.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version directly checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which correctly determines if it's possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
