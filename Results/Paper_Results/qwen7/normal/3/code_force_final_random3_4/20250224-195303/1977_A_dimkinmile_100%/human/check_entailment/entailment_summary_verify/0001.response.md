### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic Check**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
     - If `n - m` is even, it means the number of moves to add or remove cubes can be balanced.
     - If `n - m` is non-negative, it means the final number of cubes `m` can be achieved by performing `n` moves.
   - However, there is a subtle issue with this logic. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference is even, which is necessary, but it does not guarantee that the number of moves can be balanced. For example, if `n = 3` and `m = 2`, the difference is 1, which is odd, and the program would incorrectly print "No". But if `n = 4` and `m = 2`, the difference is 2, which is even, and the program would correctly print "Yes". This logic only checks if the difference is even, not if it is achievable within `n` moves.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program logic does not fully match the problem description. Specifically, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is not sufficient to determine if the number of moves can be balanced. We need to ensure that the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is less than or equal to `n` to guarantee that the moves can be balanced.

### Correctness:
**False**
