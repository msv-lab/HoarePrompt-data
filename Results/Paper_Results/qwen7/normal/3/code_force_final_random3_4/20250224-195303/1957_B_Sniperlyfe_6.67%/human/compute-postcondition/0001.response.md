Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**: The value of `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0, the range will be empty).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\)
- `nums` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.

We need to adjust the states of the variables involved in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `i` should be 0
- `n` must be at least 1

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**
