Output State: **`i` is 1; `k` is `k - (2 ** (k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by the value of `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `nums[1]` is `2 ** (k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - (2 ** (k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as per the initial state, and `n` must still be at least 2.
