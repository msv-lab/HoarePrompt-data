Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^9. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is initially set to the value `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. Then, `k` is reduced by the sum of all values in `nums`, and finally, the last element of `nums` is incremented by the final value of `k`.**
