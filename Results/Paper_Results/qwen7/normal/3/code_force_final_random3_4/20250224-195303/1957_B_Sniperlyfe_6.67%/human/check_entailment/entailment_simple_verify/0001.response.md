### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`, and the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these numbers is maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It calls a function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence.
   - The generated sequence is stored and printed in the required format.

3. **Analyzing `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - The function initializes an array `nums` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It then sets each element of `nums` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits, which is `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1`.
   - After setting all elements to this value, it subtracts this value from `k`.
   - Finally, it adjusts the last element to ensure the total sum is `k`.

4. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is indeed flawed because it sets all elements to the same large number, which does not necessarily maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - For example, consider `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The function will set both elements to `3`, resulting in `[3, 3]`, which sums to `6` and has only `2` ones in the bitwise OR (`3 | 3 = 3`).
   - A better approach would be to distribute the sum `k` among the elements in a way that maximizes the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR.

5. **Detailed Analysis Using Annotations**:
   - **Initial State**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - **Step 1**: Initialize `nums` with zeros.
     - **Step 2**: Set each element of `nums` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits.
     - **Step 3**: Subtract this value from `k` in each iteration.
     - **Step 4**: Adjust the last element to ensure the total sum is `k`.
   - **Output State**: The `nums` list is filled with the same large number, and the last element is adjusted to make the sum correct. However, this approach does not maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR, we should aim to use the highest possible values that fit within the constraints. One effective strategy is to use the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and distribute the remaining sum accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It does not maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

**Final: False**
