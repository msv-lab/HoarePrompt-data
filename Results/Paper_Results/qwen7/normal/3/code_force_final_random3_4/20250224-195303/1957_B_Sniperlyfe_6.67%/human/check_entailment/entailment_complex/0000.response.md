Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers such that their sum equals \( k \), and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with each element set to the maximum value that can be represented with `k`'s bit length minus one. This value is calculated as \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\).
   - The loop iterates `n` times, setting each element of `nums` to this maximum value and reducing `k` accordingly.
   - After the loop, `k` is reduced by the sum of all values in `nums`, and the last element of `nums` is incremented by the final value of `k`.

3. **Binary Representation and Bitwise OR**:
   - Each element in `nums` is set to a value that has the maximum number of 1s possible within the bit length of `k`.
   - By setting most elements to this maximum value and adjusting the last element, the function ensures that the bitwise OR of all elements is maximized.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( k \) is small, the function still sets most elements to the maximum possible value and adjusts the last element to ensure the sum is correct.
   - The function handles the case where \( k \) is less than the maximum value by reducing the last element appropriately.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns a list `nums` that satisfies the conditions of the problem.

Given the analysis, the function correctly constructs the sequence according to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
