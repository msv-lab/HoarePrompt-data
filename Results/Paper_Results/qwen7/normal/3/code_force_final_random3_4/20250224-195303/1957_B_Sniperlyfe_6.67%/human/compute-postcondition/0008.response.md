Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue, `nums[i]` is set to (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `nums[i]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Given that `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration and will become 2, `i` is now 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than 2. The value of `nums[i]` is calculated based on `k.bit_length()`, which is the bit length of `k`. The expression `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` calculates a value that is one less than a power of two corresponding to the bit length of `k`.
