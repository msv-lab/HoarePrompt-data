Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` is `k` minus (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1; `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is initially set to 2. The line `k -= nums[i]` subtracts the value of `nums[i]` from `k`. Given that `nums[i]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, the value of `k` is updated accordingly. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was only mentioned in the condition for the loop to continue, not being directly involved in the operation.
