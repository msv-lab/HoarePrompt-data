You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: All elements in the `nums` list are set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the variable `k` is reduced by the sum of all values assigned to `nums`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. In each iteration, `nums[i]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest value that can be represented with `k.bit_length()` bits. This value is then subtracted from `k`. After `n` iterations, `k` will be reduced by the sum of `n` such values, and all elements in the `nums` list will be equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where each element is initially set to the value `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, then `k` is reduced by the sum of all values in `nums`, and finally, `nums[-1]` is incremented by the final value of `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^9. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is initially set to the value `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. Then, `k` is reduced by the sum of all values in `nums`, and finally, the last element of `nums` is incremented by the final value of `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `nums` where each element is initially set to the value `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, then `k` is reduced by the sum of all values in `nums`, and finally, `nums[-1]` is incremented by the final value of `k`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
