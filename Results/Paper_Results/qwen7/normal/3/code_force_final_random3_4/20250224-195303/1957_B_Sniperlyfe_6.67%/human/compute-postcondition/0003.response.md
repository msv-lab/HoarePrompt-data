Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be at least 1; `k` is `k - (2**(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by subtracting `nums[i]` from it. Given the initial state, `nums[0]` is `2**(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Therefore, `k` is now `k - (2**(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
