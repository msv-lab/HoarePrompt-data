Output State: **All elements in the `nums` list are set to the value `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`; `k` is reduced by the sum of all values assigned to `nums`, and then `nums[-1]` is incremented by the final value of `k`**.

Explanation: Initially, all elements in the `nums` list are set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the variable `k` is reduced by the sum of all these values. After the loop, `k` is further incremented by the last element of `nums`, which is now the same as the value assigned to each element in `nums`. Therefore, `nums[-1]` is updated to include the remaining value of `k`.
