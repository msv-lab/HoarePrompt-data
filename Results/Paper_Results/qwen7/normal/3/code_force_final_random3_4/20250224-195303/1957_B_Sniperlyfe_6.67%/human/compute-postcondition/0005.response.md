Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `nums[1]` is 2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1**

Explanation: The code updates `nums[i]` with the value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `nums[1]` is set to this value. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we express `nums[1]` in terms of `k`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
