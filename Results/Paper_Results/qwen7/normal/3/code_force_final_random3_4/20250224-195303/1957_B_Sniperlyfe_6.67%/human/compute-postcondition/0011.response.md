Output State: All elements in the `nums` list are set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the variable `k` is reduced by the sum of all values assigned to `nums`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. In each iteration, `nums[i]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest value that can be represented with `k.bit_length()` bits. This value is then subtracted from `k`. After `n` iterations, `k` will be reduced by the sum of `n` such values, and all elements in the `nums` list will be equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
