Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified.
- `r` is an integer that allows the loop to proceed correctly, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- The current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`, which is consistent with the given value of `j` being 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

This will print the number 1, followed by the value of `j`, which is 1, and the `end=' '` parameter ensures that there is a space after the values rather than a new line.

Output: **1 1**
