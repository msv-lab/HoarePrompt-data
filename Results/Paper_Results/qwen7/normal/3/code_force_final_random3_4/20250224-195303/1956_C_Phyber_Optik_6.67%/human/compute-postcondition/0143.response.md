Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is an integer.
- `n + r + 1` is a positive integer.
- `j` is `j_start + 2`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the following code snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
2. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object into separate arguments for the `print` function.
3. Therefore, the `print` function will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot provide a specific number. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n**
