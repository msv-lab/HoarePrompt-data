Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for j in range(1, n + r + 1):` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `n + r + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the new state of `j`**: Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be equal to its value at the start of the current iteration plus 1. Let's denote the value of `j` at the start of the current iteration as `j_start`. Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be `j_start + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range from 1 to `n + r + 1`. This means `j` should be set to `j_start + 2` (since it was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration).

5. **Maintain the conditions for `n` and `r`**: The conditions for `n` and `r` remain the same as they were at the start of the current iteration because the loop does not modify these values directly.

Given the above steps, we can now formulate the new state:

- `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j_start + 2`.
- The conditions for `n` and `r` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is an integer, and `n + r + 1` is a positive integer. `j` is `j_start + 2`**.
