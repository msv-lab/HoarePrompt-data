Output State: **`sum` is `2 * sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least `1`, `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` is `i`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sum` by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since the initial state of `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`, the new value of `sum` becomes `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables (`j`, `n`, `t`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
