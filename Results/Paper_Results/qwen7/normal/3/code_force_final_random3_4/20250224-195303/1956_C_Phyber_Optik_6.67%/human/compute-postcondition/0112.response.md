Output State: **`sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least `1`, `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` is `i`, `i` is `i + 1**.

Explanation: The code `r = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `r`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in the previous line (`i = i + 1`), the new value of `i` is used in the assignment. Therefore, `r` now holds the value of `i + 1`. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
