Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `r` is an integer that allows the loop to proceed correctly. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop continues with the current values of `j`, `n`, and `r`. If `j` is greater than `n`, the loop terminates with `j` still being 1, `n` remaining a positive integer, and `r` unchanged.
