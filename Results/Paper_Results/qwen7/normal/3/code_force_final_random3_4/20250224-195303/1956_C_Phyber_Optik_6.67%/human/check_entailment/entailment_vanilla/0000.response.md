Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calculates the sum of the matrix and the number of operations needed.
   - The logic inside the loop seems to be calculating the sum of the matrix and determining the number of operations required.
   - The sum calculation is based on the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) for the first \( r \) rows and \( i \cdot n \) for the remaining rows, where \( r \) is determined such that \( n \cdot (n + 1) / 2 > i \cdot n \).
   - The number of operations is calculated as \( n + r \), where \( r \) is the number of full rows before the partial row.
   - The operations are printed in the format specified: each operation is either a row permutation or a column permutation, and the permutations are simply the identity permutation (1, 2, ..., n).

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic for calculating the sum and the number of operations seems correct. The sum is maximized by filling the top \( r \) rows with the largest possible values and the remaining rows with the next largest values.
   - The operations are correctly formatted and do not exceed \( 2n \) in total.

Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
