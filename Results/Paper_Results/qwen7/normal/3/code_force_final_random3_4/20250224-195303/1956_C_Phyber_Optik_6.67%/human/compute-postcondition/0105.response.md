Output State: **`j` is \( n + 1 \), `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is 0, `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` is `i`, and the condition \( n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n \) is true.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `r`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `j` is still \( n + 1 \), `n` must still be at least 1, `sum` is still 0, `t` is still an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, and the condition \( n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n \) remains true.
