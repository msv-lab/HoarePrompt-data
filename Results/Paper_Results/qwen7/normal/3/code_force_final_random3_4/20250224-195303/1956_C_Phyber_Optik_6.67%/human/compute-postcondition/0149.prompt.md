Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    sum, r = 0, 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
            r = i
            sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
        else:
            sum += i * n
    print(sum, n + r)
    for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
        if j <= n:
            print(1, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        else:
            print(2, j % n, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: j is n + r + 1, n is a positive integer, and r is the largest integer such that r * n < n * (n + 1) // 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: j is n + r + 1 and n + r + 1 is the value derived from the condition \( r \) being the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `sum` will be the total sum calculated based on the conditions within the loop, `j` will be equal to `n + r + 1`, `n` will be 0 since it is decremented to 0 after the loop, `t` will be the original input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` will be the last value of `i` that satisfied the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `i` will be `n` (which is 0).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
