Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial condition that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500` remains valid after the assignment. The variable `n` is not defined or affected by this code snippet, so its initial conditions remain unchanged.
