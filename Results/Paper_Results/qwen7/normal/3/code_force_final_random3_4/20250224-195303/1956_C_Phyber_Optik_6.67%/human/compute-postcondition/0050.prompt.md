Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each iteration, if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, then `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`. After all iterations, `r` will be the last value of `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or `n` if no such `i` exists. `sum` will be the total of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for all valid `i` values.

In simpler terms, `r` will hold the largest `i` such that `i * n < n * (n + 1) // 2`, and `sum` will be the cumulative sum based on the condition mentioned.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    if j <= n:
        print(1, j, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))
    else:
        print(2, j % n, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `r` is an integer that allows the loop to proceed correctly. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop continues with the current values of `j`, `n`, and `r`. If `j` is greater than `n`, the loop terminates with `j` still being 1, `n` remaining a positive integer, and `r` unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and `r` remains unchanged regardless of whether the condition `j <= n` is true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, and `r` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
