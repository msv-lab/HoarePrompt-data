Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer
- `j` is greater than `n`
- `r` is an integer that allows the loop to proceed correctly (though `r` is not used in the print statement, it does not affect the output of the given print statement)

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Let's break down the components:
1. `2` is a constant value.
2. `j % n` computes the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`. Given that `j` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the remainder of `1 % n` will always be 1 because any number modulo itself minus one will yield 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **2 1**
