Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, n + r + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`. If `j` exceeds `n + r`, the loop terminates.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `r` is an integer that allows the loop to proceed correctly

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1, and the loop continues if `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`, the loop will continue as long as `1 <= n + r`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2).
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `r` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `r` is unchanged**.
