Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing integers `t` and `n`. For each test case, it calculates a sum based on specific conditions involving `n` and prints the sum along with a sequence of numbers. After processing all test cases, it prints a series of sequences of numbers for each test case.**
