Output State: **`sum` is `i * n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` is 0, `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sum` by adding the value of `i * n` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `sum` is now specifically `i * n`.
