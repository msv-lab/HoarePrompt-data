To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n + r + 1` is the value derived from the condition where \( r \) is the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Understanding the Condition:**
   - We need to find the value of \( r \) such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).
   - This inequality can be rearranged to \( r < \frac{n + 1}{2} \).
   - Therefore, \( r \) is the largest integer less than \( \frac{n + 1}{2} \), which means \( r = \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \).

4. **Value of `n + r + 1`:**
   - Substituting \( r = \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \) into \( n + r + 1 \):
     \[
     n + r + 1 = n + \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]

5. **Range Function:**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to \( n \).
   - When printed with `*`, it expands the range into separate arguments for the `print` function, effectively printing each number in the range on a new line.

6. **Determine `n`:**
   - Since `j` is 2, and there is no direct relationship between `j` and `n` in the given information, we need to infer `n` from the context of the condition.
   - If we assume `n` is a positive integer, then the smallest possible value for `n` that satisfies the condition would be 1 (since \( j = 2 \) does not directly affect the calculation of `n`).

7. **Calculate `r` for `n = 1`:**
   - For \( n = 1 \):
     \[
     r = \left\lfloor \frac{1 + 1}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1 \right\rfloor = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, \( n + r + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \).

8. **Range for `n = 1`:**
   - `range(1, 1 + 1)` generates the sequence `[1]`.

9. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)`, which for `n = 1` is `[1]`.

Output: **1**
