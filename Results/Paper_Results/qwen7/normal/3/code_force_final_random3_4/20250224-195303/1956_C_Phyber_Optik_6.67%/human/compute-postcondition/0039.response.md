Given the initial state:
- `j` is 2
- `n` is a positive integer
- `r` is unchanged (though `r` is not used in the print statement)

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The first argument `2` is explicitly given.
2. The second argument is `j % n`, where `j` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer. The expression `j % n` computes the remainder when `j` (which is 2) is divided by `n`.

Since `n` is a positive integer, the possible remainders when dividing 2 by `n` depend on the value of `n`:
   - If `n > 2`, then `2 % n` will be 2.
   - If `n = 2`, then `2 % 2` will be 0.
   - If `1 < n < 2`, this case is not possible since `n` must be an integer.

Therefore, the second part of the print statement will either be `2` or `0` depending on the value of `n`.

The `end=' '` ensures that there is no newline after the print statement, but it does not affect the content being printed.

Output: **2, 2 if n > 2, 0 if n = 2**
