Output State: **j is n + r + 1, n is a positive integer, and r is the largest integer such that r * n < n * (n + 1) // 2.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `n + r + 1`. The variable `n` will remain a positive integer. The variable `r` will be set to the largest integer such that `r * n < n * (n + 1) // 2`, as per the conditions specified in the loop. The loop will terminate once `j` exceeds `n + r`, making `j` equal to `n + r + 1`.
