Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `sum` will be the total sum calculated based on the conditions within the loop, `j` will be equal to `n + r + 1`, `n` will be 0 since it is decremented to 0 after the loop, `t` will be the original input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` will be the last value of `i` that satisfied the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `i` will be `n` (which is 0).**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `sum` will contain the accumulated sum based on the conditions inside the loop.
- The variable `j` will remain at its final value, which is `n + r + 1`.
- The variable `n` will be 0 because it is decremented to 0 after the loop.
- The variable `t` will still hold the original input integer representing the number of remaining iterations.
- The variable `r` will be the last value of `i` that satisfied the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- The variable `i` will be `n`, which is 0, since `n` is set to 0 at the end of the loop.
