Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and the value of \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) is greater than \( i \times n \); `r` is 1; `sum` is \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 **.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sum` by adding the value of \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \). The other variables (`i` and `r`) remain unchanged. The condition involving `n` and `i` is preserved as it was a precondition.
