Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sum` is equal to either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or increased by `(i + 1) * n`.
   - `r` is equal to `i + 1` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true. Otherwise, `sum` is updated by adding `i * n` to its current value.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than the current value of `i` in the loop.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if it was `i` before, it will now be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`sum` is equal to either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or increased by `(i + 2) * n`, and `r` is equal to `i + 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > (i + 1) * n` holds true. Otherwise, `sum` is updated by adding `(i + 1) * n` to its current value.**

However, since we only need to adjust the states of the loop head variables, the final answer is:

State: **`sum` is equal to either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or increased by `(i + 1) * n`, and `r` is equal to `i + 1` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true. Otherwise, `sum` is updated by adding `i * n` to its current value.**

But for clarity in the context of the loop head variables:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same as before**.
