Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly given a value in the initial state, but it starts from 1 according to the `range(1, n + 1)` function.
   - `n` is an input integer, and its value is not specified in the initial state.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be 1 (the starting point of the range), and `n` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1, we don't need to change it.
   - However, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the other given variables**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `sum` is 0.
   - `r` is 0.
   - These variables are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and the initial values of `i` (which is 1).

**Final State:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0**
