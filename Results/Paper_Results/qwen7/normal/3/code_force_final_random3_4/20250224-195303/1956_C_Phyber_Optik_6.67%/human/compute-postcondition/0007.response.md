Output State: **`sum` is equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `i` is an integer, `r` is equal to `i`**.

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. The initial state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged, and `r` is still equal to `i`. The new value of `sum` is specifically `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
