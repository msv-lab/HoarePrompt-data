Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `sum` is `i * n` which equals `2 * n`.**

The code updates the `sum` variable to be the sum of its current value and the product of `i` (which is 2) and `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the updated `sum` is `2 * n`.
