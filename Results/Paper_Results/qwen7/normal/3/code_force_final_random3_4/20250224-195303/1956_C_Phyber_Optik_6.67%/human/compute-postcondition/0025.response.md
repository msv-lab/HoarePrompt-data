Output State: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each iteration, if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, then `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`. After all iterations, `r` will be the last value of `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` was true, or `n` if no such `i` exists. `sum` will be the total of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for all valid `i` values.

In simpler terms, `r` will hold the largest `i` such that `i * n < n * (n + 1) // 2`, and `sum` will be the cumulative sum based on the condition mentioned.
