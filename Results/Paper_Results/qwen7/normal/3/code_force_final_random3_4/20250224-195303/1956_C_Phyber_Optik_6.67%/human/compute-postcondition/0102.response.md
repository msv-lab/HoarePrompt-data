Output State: **`j` is \( n + r + 1 \), `n` is an input integer, the number of remaining iterations is \( t - 1 \), `sum` is 0, `r` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `sum` and `r`, to 0. This does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, or the number of remaining iterations (`t - 1`). Therefore, these values remain unchanged.
