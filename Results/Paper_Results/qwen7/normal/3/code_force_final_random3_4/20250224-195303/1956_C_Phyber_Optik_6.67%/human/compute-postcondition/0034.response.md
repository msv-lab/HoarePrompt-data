Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `r` is an integer that allows the loop to proceed correctly. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the program continues as usual with the loop condition satisfied. If `j` is greater than `n`, then `j` remains 1, `n` remains a positive integer, and `r` remains an integer that allows the loop to proceed correctly.
