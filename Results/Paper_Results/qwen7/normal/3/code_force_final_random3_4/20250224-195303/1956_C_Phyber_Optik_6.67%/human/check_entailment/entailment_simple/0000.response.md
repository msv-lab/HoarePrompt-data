Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix using at most 2n operations.
2. The given program attempts to calculate the sum of the matrix elements based on the given conditions and prints the required operations.
3. Let's analyze the logic of the program:
   - The variable `sum` is initialized to 0.
   - A loop runs from 1 to `n`, calculating the sum based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
     - If the condition is true, `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
     - Otherwise, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.
   - The program then prints the total sum and the number of operations (`n + r`).
   - Another loop runs from 1 to `n + r + 1`, generating the required operations:
     - For the first `n` values of `j`, it performs a Type 1 operation setting the entire row `j` to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - For the remaining values of `j`, it performs a Type 2 operation setting the entire column `j % n` to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. The logic seems to correctly follow the problem statement:
   - It calculates the sum based on the given conditions.
   - It generates the required operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The number of operations is controlled to be no more than 2n.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
