Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `qs`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is the first integer input converted to an integer.
   - `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers with at least one element remaining.
   - `n` is the next element in `qs`.

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must still have at least one element.
   - The variable `n` will be the next element in `qs`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `q` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `res` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `p` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `qs` should now have one less element (since `n` was taken from it).
   - `n` will be the next element in `qs`.

Given this reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`k` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `func_1(n, p)`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers with at least one element removed, `n` is the next element in `qs`**
