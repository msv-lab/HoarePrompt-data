Output State: **`k` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers that must not be an empty list**.

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since `n` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a variable that is passed as an argument to `func_1`. The values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain unchanged. `res` now contains the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)`.
