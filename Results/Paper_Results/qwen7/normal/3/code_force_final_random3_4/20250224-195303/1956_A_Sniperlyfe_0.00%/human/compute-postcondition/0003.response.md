Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `k, q = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `k` and `q`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was a positive integer before the code execution.
