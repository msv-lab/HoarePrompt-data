Output State: **`k` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `func_1(n, p)`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers with at least one element removed, `n` is the next element in `qs`, `res` is updated with `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since `n` is the next element in `qs`, the list `res` is updated with the new value. All other variables remain unchanged.
