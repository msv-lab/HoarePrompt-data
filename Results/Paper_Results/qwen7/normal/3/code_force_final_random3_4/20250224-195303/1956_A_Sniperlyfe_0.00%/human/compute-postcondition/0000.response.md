Output State: **`k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100; `p` is a list of k positive integers representing the sequence a where 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100; `qs` is a list of q positive integers representing n_i where 1 <= n_i <= 100; `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain unchanged from their initial state.
