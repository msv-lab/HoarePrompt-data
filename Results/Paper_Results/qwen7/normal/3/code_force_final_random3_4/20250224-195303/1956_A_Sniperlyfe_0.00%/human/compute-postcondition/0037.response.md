Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the last element in `qs` that was used in the loop, `k` is updated to the first integer input, `q` is updated to the second integer input, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `res` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `res`. This does not affect the values of `qs`, `n`, `k`, `q`, or `p`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
