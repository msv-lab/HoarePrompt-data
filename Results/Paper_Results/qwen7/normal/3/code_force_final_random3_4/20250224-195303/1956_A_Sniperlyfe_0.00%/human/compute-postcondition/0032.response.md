Output State: `k` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers with all elements processed, `n` is the last element in `qs` that was used in the loop.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, processing every element in `qs`. The `res` list now contains the result of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element `n` in `qs`, in the order they appeared. The `qs` list is now empty since all its elements have been consumed by the loop.
