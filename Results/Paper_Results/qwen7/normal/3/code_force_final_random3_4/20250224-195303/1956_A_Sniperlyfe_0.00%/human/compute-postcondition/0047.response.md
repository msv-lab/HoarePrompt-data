Output State: **`qs` must contain at least two elements, `n` is the second element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(func_1(n, p))` appends the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The value of `n` remains the second element in `qs`, and `res` now includes the result of `func_1(n, p)`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
