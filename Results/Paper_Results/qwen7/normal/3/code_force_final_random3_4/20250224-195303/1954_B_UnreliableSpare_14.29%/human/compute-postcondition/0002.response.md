Output State: **`flag` is True, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, the array `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

The code simply initializes the variable `flag` to `True`. No other changes are made to the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
