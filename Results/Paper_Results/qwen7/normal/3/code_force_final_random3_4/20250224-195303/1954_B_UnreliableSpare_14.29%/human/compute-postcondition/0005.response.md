Output State: **`flag` is False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input. The current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to the previous value `arr[i - 1]`.**

The code simply changes the value of `flag` from `True` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
