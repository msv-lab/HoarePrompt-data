Based on the initial state provided:

- `flag` remains `False`.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `i` after the loop completes.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `i` is `-1`.
- `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `val` found during the loop.
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.
- `val` is the last element of the list `a` that was checked in the loop.

Given that the `if` condition is `if (flag):` and `flag` remains `False`, the block inside the `if` statement will not be executed. Therefore, the only thing being printed is the hardcoded value `-1`.

Output: **-1**
