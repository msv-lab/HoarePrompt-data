`cnt` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cnt` was increased by 1, so the new value of `cnt` is the original value of `cnt` plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` remains `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `i` is `n`, `cnt` is increased by 1, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between `ans` and `cnt` if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`.
