You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the given array a is beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `flag` remains False, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to the value of `i` which will be `n-1` after the loop completes, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and `i` is `n-1`. The condition `arr[i] != arr[i - 1]` was found to be true at some point during the loop's execution, causing `flag` to be set to `False` and breaking out of the loop.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: `flag` remains `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `i` after the loop completes, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and `i` is `-1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` and then `i` becomes `-1`). `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `val` found during the loop, and `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered when `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`. `val` is the last element of the list `a` that was checked in the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `ans` will hold the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are different from `val`. The variable `cnt` will reflect the current count of consecutive elements equal to `val`, and `val` will be the last element of the list `a` that was compared against `val` in the loop.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value between its initial value and the maximum count of consecutive equal elements found in the list a)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an array of integers `a` for multiple test cases. For each test case, it first checks if the array is "beautiful" (i.e., all elements are the same). If the array is not beautiful, it finds the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements that are different from the most frequent element in the array. If the array is beautiful, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the length of the longest sequence of non-matching consecutive elements.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem defines a "beautiful" array as one where all elements can become the same by repeatedly performing a specific operation.
   - We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, or return -1 if it's impossible.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If yes, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

3. **Detailed Breakdown:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is a mistake.
   - The logic to determine if the array is already uniform is correct.
   - The logic to count the minimum number of removals to break the beauty condition is flawed:
     - It incorrectly assumes that the array is beautiful if all elements are the same.
     - It uses a variable `val` to track the current value and `cnt` to count consecutive occurrences.
     - However, this approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify segments where the beauty condition can be broken.
   - We should iterate through the array and count the longest segment of consecutive identical elements.
   - The minimum number of removals needed would be the length of the array minus the length of the longest such segment.

### Corrected Code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1
        
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_length)
```

### Conclusion:
The given code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: **False**
