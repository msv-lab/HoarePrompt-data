### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem defines a "beautiful" array as one where all elements can become the same by repeatedly performing a specific operation.
   - We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, or return -1 if it's impossible.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If yes, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

3. **Detailed Breakdown:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is a mistake.
   - The logic to determine if the array is already uniform is correct.
   - The logic to count the minimum number of removals to break the beauty condition is flawed:
     - It incorrectly assumes that the array is beautiful if all elements are the same.
     - It uses a variable `val` to track the current value and `cnt` to count consecutive occurrences.
     - However, this approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify segments where the beauty condition can be broken.
   - We should iterate through the array and count the longest segment of consecutive identical elements.
   - The minimum number of removals needed would be the length of the array minus the length of the longest such segment.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly identifies that the array is not beautiful if there exists any segment where the beauty condition can be broken.
   - The logic to count the longest segment of consecutive identical elements is correct.
   - The final output is the length of the array minus the length of the longest segment of consecutive identical elements, which gives the minimum number of removals needed.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment correctly identified the flaw in the given code.
   - However, the provided corrected code in the original assessment is also flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where the array is already uniform (all elements are the same).
   - The original code, despite its flaws, does not handle the uniform array case correctly, which is a critical part of the problem.

### Corrected Code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1
        
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_length)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original code has a flaw in handling the uniform array case, but the logic to find the minimum number of removals is fundamentally correct. The corrected code provided in the original assessment is also flawed in the same way. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw but not in providing a fully correct solution.

**Final: False**
