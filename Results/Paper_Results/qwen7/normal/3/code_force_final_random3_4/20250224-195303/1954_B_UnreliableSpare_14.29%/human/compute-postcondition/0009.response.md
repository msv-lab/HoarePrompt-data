Output State: **`flag` is False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The line `flag = False` simply reassigns the value of `flag` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` was initially 2 and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet, its value remains 3 after the code execution.
