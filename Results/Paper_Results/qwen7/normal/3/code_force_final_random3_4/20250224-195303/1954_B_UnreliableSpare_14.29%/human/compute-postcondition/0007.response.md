Postcondition: **`flag` is False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
