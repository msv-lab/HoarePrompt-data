Output State: **`flag` remains False, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is set to `Decimal('Infinity')`, `val` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`.**

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 0, so after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
