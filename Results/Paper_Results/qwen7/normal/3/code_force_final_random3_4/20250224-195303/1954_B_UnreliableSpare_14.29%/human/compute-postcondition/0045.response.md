Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases through an array `a` of integers. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and an array `a` of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It checks if the array `a` is beautiful and returns a result based on the conditions provided.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and an array `a` of integers. The function verifies if the array `a` meets certain criteria (defined as "beautiful") and returns a result accordingly.
