Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to correctly identify and count the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `3 2 2 2`, the program outputs `-1`. However, the array is already beautiful, and no removals are needed. This is correct.
   - For the input `5 1 2 1 2 1`, the program outputs `1`. This is also correct because removing the second element (`2`) makes the array `[1, 1, 2, 1]`, which is no longer beautiful.
   - For the input `1 1`, the program outputs `-1`. This is correct because the array is already beautiful and no removals are needed.
   - For the input `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`, the program outputs `3`. This is incorrect. The correct answer should be `2` because removing the second and fifth elements (`3` and `5`) results in `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, which is no longer beautiful.

2. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of removals needed. It assumes that the first occurrence of a different value will determine the minimum removals, but this is not always the case. The program should consider the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and calculate the removals based on that.

To fix the program, we need to:
- Identify the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements.
- Calculate the minimum number of removals required to break this sequence.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max_len = 1
        current_len = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
                current_len += 1
                max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
            else:
                current_len = 1
        if max_len == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_len)
```

This corrected program correctly identifies the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and calculates the minimum number of removals needed to make the array non-beautiful.
