Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable used in the `for` loop, which is `_` (an underscore). However, since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider the input provided by `int(input())` as the number of iterations.

2. **Initial State**: The initial state is not explicitly given, but we know that the list `ops` will have been fully processed in reverse order after the loop completes. This means that the loop processes each element of `ops[::-1]` (reverse of `ops`) in sequence.

3. **Loop Body Analysis**: The loop body processes each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops[::-1]`. It checks if the last element of the first tuple (`p1[-1]`) is equal to `v2`. If it is, then `v1` is appended to the first tuple. If not, the first tuple remains unchanged.

4. **State Adjustment**: Since we are asked to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on how the state changes based on the loop head and the input.

5. **Input and Iteration**: The loop runs for a number of times equal to the integer input from the user. Each iteration processes one tuple from `ops[::-1]`.

6. **State at the Start of Next Iteration**: At the start of the next iteration, the list `ops` will still be the same as before, but the processing will move to the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except that the processing will move to the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`.

**Example Answer**:
Since the loop processes one tuple per iteration, and we don't have specific values for `ops`, we can generalize the answer based on the structure of the problem.

State: **`ops` will have been partially processed in reverse order, with the current tuple being processed being the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`**.

To be more precise, if `ops` originally had `n` tuples, after `k` iterations, the first `k` tuples in `ops[::-1]` would have been processed. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the first `k+1` tuples in `ops[::-1]` would have been processed.

However, since we are asked to provide a specific state, we can say:

State: **`ops` will have been partially processed in reverse order, with the current tuple being processed being the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`**.

This is a general state that captures the essence of the problem without specific values.
