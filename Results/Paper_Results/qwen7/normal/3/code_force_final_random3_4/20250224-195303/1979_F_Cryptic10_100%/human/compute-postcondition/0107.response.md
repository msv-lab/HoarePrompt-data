Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements, the last but one element of `vx` is `v2`, the first element of `vx` is now `v3`, and `_` is not used; `ops` is a list containing two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ops` by adding two tuples to it. The first tuple is `(v3, 0)`, where `v3` is the first element of `vx`. The second tuple is `(v1, 0)`, where `v1` is assumed to be a variable that already exists in the context. The last but one element of `vx` remains `v2`, and the first element of `vx` is updated to `v3`. The variable `_` is not used and remains unchanged.
