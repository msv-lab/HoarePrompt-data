Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to len(vx) - 3, and `ops` is a list. If the value of `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` contains one tuple (v1, v2). Otherwise, `ops` contains two tuples [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)], where `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)`.**
