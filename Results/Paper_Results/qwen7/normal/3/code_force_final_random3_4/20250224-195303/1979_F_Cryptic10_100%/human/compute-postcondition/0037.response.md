Output State: **`ops` is a list containing at least one tuple where the last element of the first tuple is updated based on the condition (if the last element of the first tuple is equal to `v2`, then append `v1` to the first tuple, otherwise the first tuple remains unchanged)**.

This means that within the `ops` list, there is at least one tuple. The last element of the first tuple in this list is checked against `v2`. If they are equal, then `v1` is appended to the first tuple. Otherwise, the first tuple remains unchanged. The other elements of the `ops` list and the values of `v1` and `v2` are not specified, so they remain as they were in the initial state.
