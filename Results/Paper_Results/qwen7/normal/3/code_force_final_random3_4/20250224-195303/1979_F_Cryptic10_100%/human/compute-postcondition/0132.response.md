Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers: `t` and `n`. It verifies that `t` is within the range 1 to 1000 and `n` is within the range 2 to 10^5. If these conditions are met, it performs some unspecified operation (since no specific operation is mentioned in the output). If any condition is not met, it handles the error accordingly.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `t` and `n`, and validate their ranges before proceeding with further processing. If the validation fails, appropriate error handling is expected to occur.
