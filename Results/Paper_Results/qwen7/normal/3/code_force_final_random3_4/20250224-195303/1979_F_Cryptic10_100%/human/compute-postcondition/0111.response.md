Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements, `v2` can be any value, `v3` can be any value, `v1` is the second last element of `vx`, `v2` is the last element of `vx`.**

Explanation: The code `v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)` assigns the second last element of `vx` to `v1` and the last element of `vx` to `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v1` now holds the second last element of `vx` and `v2` holds the last element of `vx`.
