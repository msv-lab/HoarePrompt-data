Postcondition: `vx` has at least 2 elements. If `v2` (which is the last but one element of the original `vx`) is greater than 0, then `vx` will have its first element as the last but one element of the original `vx` and its second element as the last element of the original `vx`. `v2` will be equal to the last but one element of the original `vx`, `v1` does not exist, and `ops` is a list containing a tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is not greater than 0, then the first element of `vx` will be the third last element of the original `vx` (now `v3`), and `ops` will be a list containing two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
