Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to len(vx) - 4 with `v1` removed, `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)` and `_` is not used.**

The code `v3, _ = q(0)` calls the function `q` with argument `0` and assigns the result to `v3`. The underscore `_` is used to discard the second return value, which means it is not used. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
