Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements, `v2` is now equal to the last but one element of `vx`, and `v1` is removed from `vx`.**

Explanation: The code removes the last element of `vx`, which was stored in `v1`. Therefore, `v1` is no longer a valid reference and has been removed. The second last element of `vx` is now referenced by `v2`. Since `vx` had at least 3 elements initially, after removing one element, it still has at least 2 elements.
