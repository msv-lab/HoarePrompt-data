Output State: **`ops` now contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` added to its end; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) excluding `v1`; `v1` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`; `v2` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`; `v2` is less than or equal to 0; `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)` and `vx` does not contain `v3`.**

Explanation:
- `ops` is updated by adding the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` to its end.
- The value of `vx` remains unchanged as the operation does not affect it.
- The value of `v1` remains unchanged as the operation does not affect it.
- The value of `v2` remains unchanged as the operation does not affect it.
- The value of `v3` remains unchanged as the operation does not affect it.
