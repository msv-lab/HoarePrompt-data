Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ops` will have been partially processed in reverse order, with the current tuple being the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), and `ops` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ops` now either contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` as its last element or contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` added to its end. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) excluding `v1`. `v1` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`. `v2` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`. If `v2` is greater than 0, the last tuple in `ops` is `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, the last two tuples in `ops` are `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, where `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)` and `vx` does not contain `v3`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 4`; `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`; `vx` has had its `v1` element removed. If `v2 > 0`, then `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `ops` is equal to `[('v3', 0), ('len(vx) - 4', 0)]`, `v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` does not contain `v3`, and `_` is not used.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 1`, and `vx` does not contain its `v1` element. If `v2 > 0`, then `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `v3` is the return value of `q(0)`, `vx` does not contain its `v3` element, and `ops` is `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
