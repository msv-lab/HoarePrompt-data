Output State: **`v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 4`; `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`; `vx` does not contain `v3`; `_` is not used.**

Explanation: The code removes `v3` from the list `vx`. The values of `v1` and `v2` are derived from the length of `vx`, so they remain unchanged. The variable `_` is not used, so its state remains unaffected. After the removal, `v3` is no longer in the list `vx`.
