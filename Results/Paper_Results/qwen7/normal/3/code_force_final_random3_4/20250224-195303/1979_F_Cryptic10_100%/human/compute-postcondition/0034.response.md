Output State: `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing a single integer, and `ops` is a list containing up to `n-2` tuples.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the set `vx` will contain only one element because the loop continues as long as the length of `vx` is greater than 2. Each iteration of the loop removes either one or two elements from `vx` based on the condition of `v2`. The list `ops` accumulates tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration, with a maximum of `n-2` such tuples since the loop runs until `vx` has exactly 2 elements left.
