Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is defined as `for (v1, v2) in ops[::-1]:`. The variables in the loop head are `v1` and `v2`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue if there are more tuples in `ops[::-1]`. Since `ops[::-1]` is just `ops` reversed, the loop continues as long as `ops` contains at least one tuple.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both being the last two elements of the original `vx` before the loop started.
   - `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`.
   - `p2` is a list with one element `v1`.
   - `ops` must contain at least one tuple, and `v2` is part of that tuple.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `ops[::-1]`, the next tuple in `ops[::-1]` will be used in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `v1` and `v2` will be updated to the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`.

Given that `ops` must contain at least one tuple and `v2` is part of that tuple, for the loop to execute one more time, `ops` should still contain at least one tuple, and `v1` and `v2` should be the first elements of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both being the last two elements of the original `vx` before the loop started; `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`; `p2` is a list with one element `v1`; `ops` must contain at least one tuple, and `v2` is part of that tuple; `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`**.
