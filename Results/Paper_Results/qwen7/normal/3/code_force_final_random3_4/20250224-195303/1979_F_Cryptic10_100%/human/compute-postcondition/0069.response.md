Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 1`, `vx` does not contain its `v1` element.**

Explanation: Initially, `v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`, and `vx` has had its `v1` element removed. After the line `vx.remove(v1)` is executed, `v1` is updated to be `len(vx) - 2` (since the element at index `v1` was removed, reducing the length by 1), and `v2` is updated to be `len(vx) - 1`. Therefore, `v1` is now `len(vx) - 3` (as it was initially `len(vx) - 4` and decreased by 1 due to removal), and `v2` is `len(vx) - 1`. The list `vx` no longer contains its `v1` element.
