Output State: **`v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 4`; `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`; `v3` is the result of `q(0)` and `_` is not used.**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, and `vx` has had its `v1` element removed. The code `v3, _ = q(0)` assigns the result of `q(0)` to `v3` and ignores the second return value (denoted by `_`). Since no specific value or behavior of `q(0)` is given, `v3` is simply the result of `q(0)`. The removal of the `v1` element from `vx` affects the values of `v1` and `v2`, changing them to `len(vx) - 4` and `len(vx) - 2`, respectively.
