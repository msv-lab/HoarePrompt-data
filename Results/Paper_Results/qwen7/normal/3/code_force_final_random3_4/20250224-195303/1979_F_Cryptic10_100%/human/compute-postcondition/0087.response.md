Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `vx` is a set containing the two largest integers from the original set.
   - `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`.
   - `p2` is a list containing all elements added during the loop executions.
   - `ops` is a list of tuples that has been fully processed, meaning it is now empty.
   - `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`. Since `ops` is empty, `v1` does not exist.
   - `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`. Similarly, since `ops` is empty, `v2` does not exist.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
   ```

   - `p1[::-1]` reverses the list `p1`.
   - `p1[::-1] + p2` concatenates the reversed `p1` with `p2`.
   - `map(str, ...)` converts each element in the concatenated list to a string.
   - `' '.join(...)` joins these strings with spaces.
   - The result is formatted into a string prefixed with `!` and printed.

Given the initial state, `p1` contains the two largest integers from the original set, and `p2` contains all elements added during the loop executions. Since `ops` is empty, `v1` and `v2` do not affect the concatenation process.

Therefore, the print statement will output the reversed `p1` followed by `p2`, joined by spaces, and prefixed with `!`.

Output: **! [largest_integer2 largest_integer1] [elements_added_during_loop]**
