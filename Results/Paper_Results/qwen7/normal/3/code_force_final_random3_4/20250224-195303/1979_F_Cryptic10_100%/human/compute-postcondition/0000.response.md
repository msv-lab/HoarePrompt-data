Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a lambda function `q` is defined which prints a query and reads a list of integers as input.**

The lambda function `q` is defined to print a query in the format `? %d` where `%d` is replaced by the argument `d`. It then reads a list of integers from the input using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. However, the actual values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged after defining the function `q`.
