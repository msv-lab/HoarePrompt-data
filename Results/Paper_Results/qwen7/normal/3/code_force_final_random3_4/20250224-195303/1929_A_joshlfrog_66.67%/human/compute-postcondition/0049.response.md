Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `i` is 0
   - `l` is a positive integer

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i` in `range(l)`. This means the loop will run as long as `i` is less than `l`.

3. **Loop Execution**: Since `i` starts at 0 and `l` is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once (when `i` is 0).

4. **Adjusting States**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1.

5. **Condition Check**: The postcondition states that if `nums[0] < y`, then no changes are made to `i` and `l`. If `nums[0] >= y`, then no changes are made to `i` and `l`. Since no changes are made, `l` remains the same.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `l`.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 1
- `l` is a positive integer

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `l` is a positive integer**
