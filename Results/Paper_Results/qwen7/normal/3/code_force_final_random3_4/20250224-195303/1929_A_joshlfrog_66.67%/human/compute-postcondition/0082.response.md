Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `l` is `l`, `x` is `nums[i]`, `y` remains 100000000, `e` is `t`, `l` is an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code `x = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. Since `i` was previously `i + 1`, `i` remains `i + 1`. The values of `l`, `y`, `e`, `l`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
