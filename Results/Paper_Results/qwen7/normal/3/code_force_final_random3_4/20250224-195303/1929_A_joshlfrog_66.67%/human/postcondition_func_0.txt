The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 500) and a list of \( n \) integers (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100). For each test case, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the list of integers, calculates the difference between these two values, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, it outputs the differences for each case.
