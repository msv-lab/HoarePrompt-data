Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `i` is 1, and if the element at index 1 of `nums` is less than `y`, then `y` remains unchanged. If the element at index 1 of `nums` is not less than `y`, then no change occurs to the variables.
