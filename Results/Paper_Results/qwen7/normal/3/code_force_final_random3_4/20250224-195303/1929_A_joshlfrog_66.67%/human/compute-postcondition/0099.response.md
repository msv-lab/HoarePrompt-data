Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a list of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t and the list of integers.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for t and a list of n integers. The function does not take any parameters directly but operates on the input data provided through these test cases. It processes each test case according to the specified constraints and returns relevant information for each one.
