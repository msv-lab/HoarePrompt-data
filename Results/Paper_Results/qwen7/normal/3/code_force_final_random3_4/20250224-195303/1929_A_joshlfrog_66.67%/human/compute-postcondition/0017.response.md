Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is now equal to `nums[i]`, and `y` remains unchanged.**

The code `x = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `x`. The other variables (`t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, and `y`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
