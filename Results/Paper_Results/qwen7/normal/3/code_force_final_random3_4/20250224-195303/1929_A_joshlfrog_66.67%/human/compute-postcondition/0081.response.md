Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < l`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is an index such that `i` must be less than `l`.
   - `x` is now equal to `y`, which is either `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than `y` or remains 100000000 otherwise.
   - `y` remains 100000000.
   - `e` is `t`.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers created from user input.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `l`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `l` remains unchanged.

6. **Post-iteration conditions**:
   - `x` is now equal to `y`, which is either `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than `y` or remains 100000000 otherwise. Since `i` is incremented, `x` will be updated based on `nums[i+1]`.
   - `y` remains 100000000.
   - `e` remains `t`.
   - `l` remains the same.
   - `nums` remains the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `l` is `l`, `x` is now equal to `y`, which is either `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than `y` or remains 100000000 otherwise, `y` remains 100000000, `e` is `t`, `l` is an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers created from user input.**
