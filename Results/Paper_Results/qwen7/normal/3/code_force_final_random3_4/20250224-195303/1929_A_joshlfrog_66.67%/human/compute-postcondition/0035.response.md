Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the maximum value found in the `nums` list, and `y` is the minimum value found in the `nums` list. The input string is split into a list of integers which replaces the original `nums` list.**

Explanation: The code `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` takes an input string, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `nums`. The values of `t`, `e`, `l`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, but `nums` is updated to reflect the new list of integers.
