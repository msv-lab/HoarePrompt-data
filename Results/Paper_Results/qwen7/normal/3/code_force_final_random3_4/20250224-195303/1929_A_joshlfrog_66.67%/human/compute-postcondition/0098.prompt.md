Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. No other variables are affected.
Code of the loop:
for e in range(t):
    l = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    x = 0
    y = 100000000
    for i in range(l):
        if nums[i] > x:
            x = nums[i]
        if nums[i] < y:
            y = nums[i]
    print(x - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the maximum value found in the `nums` list, and `y` is the minimum value found in the `nums` list.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `l` (the length of the `nums` list). The variable `x` will hold the maximum value found in the `nums` list during the loop's execution, and `y` will hold the minimum value found in the `nums` list during the loop's execution. The other variables (`t`, `e`, and `l`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` equal to `l-1`, and `x` set to the maximum value found in the list `nums`. The variable `y` remains unchanged at its initial value of 100000000.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `l`, `x` will hold the maximum value from the list `nums`, and `y` will hold the minimum value from the list `nums`. The variable `e` remains `t`, `l` remains an input integer, and `nums` is the list of integers created from user input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
