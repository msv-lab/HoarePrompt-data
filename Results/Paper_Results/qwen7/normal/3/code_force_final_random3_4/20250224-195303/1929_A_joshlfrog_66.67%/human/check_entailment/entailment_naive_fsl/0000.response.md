Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program instead finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty according to the given formula.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
5
3
2 1 3
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
1
```

This is because the program calculates `x - y` where `x` is the maximum value and `y` is the minimum value in the array. For the array `[2, 1, 3]`, the maximum value is `3` and the minimum value is `1`, so the program outputs `3 - 1 = 2`.

To correctly solve the problem, Sasha needs to rearrange the elements such that the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` is maximized. This requires sorting the array and then calculating the beauty as described. The provided solution does not achieve this.
