Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the last character in the string `s`; `c` is equal to `n`; `mi` is the index (1-based) of the first 'B' in the string `s`, or 0 if there is no 'B' in the string. The variable `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and the other variables (`ma`, `t`, `n`, `m`) retain their initial values.
Code of the loop:
for j in s[::-1]:
    d += 1
    if j == 'B':
        ma = len(s) - d
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the last character in the original string `s`; `c` is `n`; `mi` is the index (1-based) of the first 'B' in the string `s`, or 0 if there is no 'B' in the string; `d` is 1; `l` is an empty list; `ma` is `n - 1`; if `j` is 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the second-to-last character in the original string `s`; `c` is `n`; `mi` is the index (1-based) of the first 'B' in the string `s`, or 0 if there is no 'B' in the string `s`; `d` is 2; `l` is an empty list; `ma` is `n - 2`; if the second-to-last character `j` is 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the last character in the original string `s`; `c` is `n`; `mi` is the index (1-based) of the first 'B' in the string `s`, or 0 if there is no 'B' in the string `s`; `d` is 3; `l` is an empty list; `ma` is `n - 3`. If the last character `j` is 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
