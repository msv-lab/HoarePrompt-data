Functionality: **The function processes a binary string `s` of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10) consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. It calculates and returns a value based on the positions of the first and last 'B' characters in the string. Specifically, it returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the first 'B', plus 2. If no 'B' is found, it returns 2.**
