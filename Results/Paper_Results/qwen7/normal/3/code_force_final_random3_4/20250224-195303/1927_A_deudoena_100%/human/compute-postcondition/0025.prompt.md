Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in `s` is 'B', `m` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in s:
    c += 1
    if j == 'B':
        mi = c
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the first character in the string `s`; `c` is 1; if `j` is 'B', then `mi` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the second character in the string `s`; `c` is 2, and if `j` equals 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the third character in the string `s`; `mi` is 3. If `j` equals 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the if condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
