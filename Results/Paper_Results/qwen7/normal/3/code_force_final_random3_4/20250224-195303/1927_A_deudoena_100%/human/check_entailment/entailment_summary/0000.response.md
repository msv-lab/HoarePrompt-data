Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is supposed to calculate the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that need to be painted white so that all cells become white. However, the logic implemented in `func_1()` does not achieve this goal.

2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The function finds the positions of the first and last 'B' characters in the string.
   - It calculates `ma` as the distance from the end of the string to the last 'B'.
   - It calculates `mi` as the distance from the start of the string to the first 'B'.
   - It returns `ma - mi + 2`, which is not the correct approach to find the minimum segment length.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the minimum segment length, you should identify the first occurrence of 'B' and the last occurrence of 'B'. The segment length required would be the distance between these two positions plus one (since both ends are inclusive).

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input "WBBWBW", the first 'B' is at index 2 and the last 'B' is at index 5. The correct answer should be `5 - 2 + 1 = 4`.
   - The provided program incorrectly calculates `ma - mi + 2`, which results in `6 - 2 + 2 = 6`.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **False**
