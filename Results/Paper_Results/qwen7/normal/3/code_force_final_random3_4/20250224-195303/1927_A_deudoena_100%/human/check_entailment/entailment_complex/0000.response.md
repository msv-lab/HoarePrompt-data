Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white so that all cells become white.
- The provided function `func_1()` incorrectly calculates the required segment length. It finds the positions of the first and last 'B' characters and computes the distance between them plus 2. However, this approach does not always yield the correct result. For instance, if the black cells are not at the ends but are scattered, the computed length might be too large.
- Let's consider a few examples:
  - For "WBBWBW", the correct answer should be 4, but the function would return 4 - 2 + 2 = 4, which is correct in this case.
  - For "BBW", the correct answer should be 2, but the function would return 3 - 1 + 2 = 4, which is incorrect.
- A correct approach would be to find the maximum distance between consecutive 'B' characters plus 1 (since we need to cover the entire segment including the boundaries).

Given the analysis, the function provided does not correctly solve the problem in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
