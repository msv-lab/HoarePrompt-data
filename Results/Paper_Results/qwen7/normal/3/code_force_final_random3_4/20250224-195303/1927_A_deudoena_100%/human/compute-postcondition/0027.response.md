Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B', `j` is the last character in the original string `s`, `c` is `n`, `mi` is the index (1-based) of the first 'B' in the string `s`, or 0 if there is no 'B' in the string, `d` is 1, `l` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `d += 1` increments the value of `d` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `d` is now 1, while `s`, `j`, `c`, `mi`, and `l` retain their initial states.
