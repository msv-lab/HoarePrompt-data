### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that, when painted white, will turn all black cells in the segment to white.
   - The solution should work for multiple test cases, each with a different strip configuration.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` but does not pass any parameters to it, which is incorrect.
   - `func_1()` is supposed to calculate the minimum length of the segment to paint white.

3. **Issues in `func_1()`:**
   - The function `func_1()` does not correctly identify the minimum segment length.
   - It calculates `mi` as the position of the first black cell and `ma` as the position of the last black cell from the end.
   - The formula `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the correct segment length needed to cover all black cells.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the minimum segment length, we need to find the distance between the first and last black cells and add 1 to cover both ends.
   - If there are no black cells, the entire strip is already white, so the length is 0.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - We should iterate through the string to find the first and last positions of 'B'.
   - Calculate the distance between these positions and add 1.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    # Find the first and last positions of 'B'
    first_black = s.find('B')
    last_black = s.rfind('B')
    
    # If no black cells, return 0
    if first_black == -1:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the minimum segment length
    min_length = last_black - first_black + 1
    return min_length

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum segment length. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
