Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the third character in the string `s`; `mi` is 3. If `j` equals 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the if condition.
