Output State: **Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the last character in the original string `s`; `c` is `n`; `mi` is the index (1-based) of the first 'B' in the string `s`, or 0 if there is no 'B' in the string `s`; `d` is `n`; `l` is an empty list; `ma` is `0`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `d` will have incremented by 1 for each character in the string `s` since the loop runs once for each character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`. Therefore, `d` will be equal to the length of the string `s`, which is `n`. Since the loop breaks when it encounters the first 'B' from the end, `ma` will be set to `n - d` at that point, but since `d` will be `n` by the end, `ma` will become `0`. All other variables (`j`, `c`, `mi`, `l`) retain their final values as described in the given conditions.
