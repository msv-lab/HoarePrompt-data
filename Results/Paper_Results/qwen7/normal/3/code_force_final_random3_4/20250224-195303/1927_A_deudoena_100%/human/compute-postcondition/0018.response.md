Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in s:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s` to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'.
   - `j` is the second character in the string `s`.
   - `c` is 2.
   - If `j` equals 'B', we break out of the loop.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is the second character in the string `s`, after the previous iteration, `j` would have been set to the second character of `s`.
   - For the loop to continue, the next character in `s` (the first character) needs to be processed. Therefore, `j` should now be the first character of `s`.
   - The string `s` will be reduced by one character since `j` has already been processed.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `s` will now be the string `s` without its first character.
   - `j` will be the first character of the new `s`.

6. **Final State**:
   - `s` must be the string `s` without its first character.
   - `j` must be the first character of the new `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the first character in the string `s`; `c` is 2**.
