Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the second-to-last character in the original string `s`; `c` is `n`; `mi` is the index (1-based) of the first 'B' in the string `s`, or 0 if there is no 'B' in the string `s`; `d` is 2; `l` is an empty list; `ma` is `n - 2`; if the second-to-last character `j` is 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
