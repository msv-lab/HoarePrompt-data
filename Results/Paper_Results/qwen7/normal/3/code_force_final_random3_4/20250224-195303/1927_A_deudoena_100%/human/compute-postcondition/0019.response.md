Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. The loop will continue as long as there are characters left to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'.
   - `j` is the second character in the string `s`.
   - `c` is 2.
   - If `j` equals 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the second character in the string `s`, after the first iteration, `j` would have been set to the second character.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be the third character in the string `s`.
   - The value of `c` remains unchanged unless it is modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `c` stays as 2.
   - The string `s` itself does not change; it still consists of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'.

5. **Final State**:
   - `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'.
   - `j` is now the third character in the string `s`.
   - `c` is still 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the third character in the string `s`; `c` is 2**
