Output State: **The elements in the array `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` are all set to the value `i-1`. The list `res` contains tuples indicating the operations performed, and the variables `is_already_stairs`, `start_index`, and `i` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called, which means that the loop will continue to increment `j` from `start_index` up to `start_index + (i - 1) + 1`, setting every element in the array `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + (i - 1) + 1` to the value `i - 1`. After all iterations, `j` will reach `start_index + (i - 1) + 1`, and every element in the array `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + (i - 1) + 1` will be set to the value `i - 1`. The list `res` will contain tuples indicating the operations performed, and the other variables (`is_already_stairs`, `start_index`, and `i`) will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
