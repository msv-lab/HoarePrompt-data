Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to solve a different problem related to maximizing the sum using a divide-and-conquer approach, but they do not directly address the MEX (Minimum Excludant) operation required by the problem.

2. **Misunderstanding of MEX Operation**: The problem requires setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX of that subarray. The current implementation does not perform this operation.

3. **Lack of MEX Calculation**: There is no function or logic to calculate the MEX of a subarray, which is essential for solving the problem.

4. **Unnecessary Complexity**: The recursive approach in `func_1` and `func_2` is overly complex and does not align with the requirement to use the MEX operation.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement a strategy that iteratively selects subarrays and sets their values to the MEX of those subarrays until no further improvement can be made. This involves calculating the MEX for each subarray and updating the array accordingly.
