Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation sets all elements from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray \([a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]\).

2. **Key Concepts**:
   - **MEX**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - **Operations**: We can perform up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

3. **Code Structure**:
   - The code defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs`.
   - `func_1` computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray using dynamic programming.
   - `func_2` finds the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - `make_stairs` is intended to create a staircase pattern to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the maximum sum of subarrays.
   - It checks all possible splits of the subarray and recursively calculates the maximum sum for each split.
   - The base case handles single-element subarrays.
   - The function returns the maximum sum for the given subarray.

5. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to identify the subarrays where the MEX value can be used to maximize the sum.
   - However, the logic here seems flawed:
     - The function does not correctly handle the construction of operations.
     - It attempts to reconstruct the operations but does not ensure that the operations are applied in a way that maximizes the sum.
     - The function does not properly account for the MEX value being applied to the entire subarray.

6. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is supposed to create a staircase pattern to achieve the maximum sum.
   - However, the function is incomplete and does not correctly implement the logic to set the elements to the MEX value.

### Conclusion:
- The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, `func_2` and `make_stairs` do not correctly generate the operations needed to maximize the sum of the array elements.
- The logic for finding the optimal operations is flawed, and the code does not ensure that the operations are applied in a way that maximizes the sum.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
