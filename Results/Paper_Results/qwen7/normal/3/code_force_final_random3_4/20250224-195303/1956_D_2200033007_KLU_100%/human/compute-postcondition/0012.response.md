Output State: `is_already_stairs` remains True, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, and for all `i` from 0 to 17 (inclusive) and for all `j` from 0 to `i` (inclusive), the value of `arr[start_index + j]` equals `j`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `is_already_stairs` remains True because no element in the sublist of `arr` starting from `start_index` up to `start_index + i` (for all valid `i`) did not match its index `j`. In other words, every element in the relevant subarray of `arr` is in its correct position according to its index.
