Output State: **`j` is `i + 1` and is now equal to `i + 1`, `arr[j]` is assigned the value `i`, `start_index + i + 1` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `arr[j]`. Since `j` was initially set to `i + 1` and must be less than or equal to `start_index + i + 1`, the assignment does not affect the condition on `j`. The value of `j` remains `i + 1`, and `arr[j]` is now equal to `i`. The value of `start_index + i + 1` remains unchanged as no operation affects it.
