Output State: **`j` is now equal to `i`, `j` must be less than or equal to `start_index + i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `arr[j]`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `j` (only that it is `start_index` and must be less than or equal to `start_index + i + 1`), the only change is that `j` is now equal to `i`. The condition that `j` must be less than or equal to `start_index + i + 1` remains valid.
