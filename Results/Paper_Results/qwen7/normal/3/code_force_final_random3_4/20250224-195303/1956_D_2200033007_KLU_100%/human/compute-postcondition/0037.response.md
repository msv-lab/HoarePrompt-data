Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variable `j` and the range it iterates over. Specifically, `j` starts from `start_index` and goes up to `start_index + i + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is currently equal to `i + 1`.
   - `arr[j]` is assigned the value `i`.
   - `start_index + i + 1` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `start_index + i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `start_index` and increases by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `i + 2`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be `i + 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `arr[j]` will be updated to `i` in the next iteration.
   - `start_index + i + 1` remains unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `j` is `i + 2`, `arr[j]` is assigned the value `i`, `start_index + i + 1` remains unchanged.**
