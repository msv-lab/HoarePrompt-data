Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` remains False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, and after the loop has executed all its iterations, at least one value in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + 17` is found to be unequal to its index `j`. This means that there exists at least one `j` in the range `0` to `17` such that the condition `arr[start_index + j] != j` holds true.
