### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided code and the problem description carefully.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
- Each operation sets all elements from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray \([a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]\).
- The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the maximum possible sum of subarrays.
   - It checks all possible splits of the subarray and recursively calculates the maximum sum for each split.
   - The base case handles single-element subarrays.
   - The function returns the maximum sum for the given subarray.
   - **Summary**: Correctly computes the maximum sum for a subarray using dynamic programming.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to identify the subarrays where the MEX value can be used to maximize the sum.
   - However, the logic here seems flawed:
     - The function does not correctly handle the construction of operations.
     - It attempts to reconstruct the operations but does not ensure that the operations are applied in a way that maximizes the sum.
     - The function does not properly account for the MEX value being applied to the entire subarray.
   - **Summary**: The function is not correctly implemented and does not generate the optimal operations.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is intended to create a staircase pattern to achieve the maximum sum.
   - However, the function is incomplete and does not correctly implement the logic to set the elements to the MEX value.
   - **Summary**: The function is incomplete and does not correctly generate the required operations.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment correctly identified that the code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The functions `func_2` and `make_stairs` do not correctly generate the operations needed to maximize the sum of the array elements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly generate the operations needed to maximize the sum of the array elements.
