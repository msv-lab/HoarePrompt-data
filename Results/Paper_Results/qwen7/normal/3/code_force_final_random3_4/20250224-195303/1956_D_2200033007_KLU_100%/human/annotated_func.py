#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, and returns a list based on specific conditions. Initially, it calculates `max_value` using `func_1(start_index, end_index)`. If the length of the subarray is 1, it checks if the element at `start_index` is non-positive; if so, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. If `max_value` equals the square of the length, it constructs a list containing a tuple `(start_index, end_index)` after calling `make_stairs(length - 1)`. For other cases, it iterates through the subarray, checking if the sum of elements and recursive function calls equals `max_value`. Based on the conditions met, it either returns a concatenated result of recursive calls or specific recursive calls.

Otherwise, the elements in the array `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` are all set to the value `i-1`, and the list `res` contains tuples indicating these operations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_stairs` checks if a segment of the list `arr` starting from index `start_index` forms a "stairs" pattern, where each element at index `start_index + j` equals `j`. If it does, the function does nothing and returns `None`. If not, the function modifies the list `arr` by setting a sequence of elements to a specific value and records the operations in the list `res`. The function continues to recursively adjust segments of `arr` until the entire list satisfies the "stairs" pattern or the recursion reaches its base case. The function does not return any value; instead, it modifies the input list `arr` and populates the list `res` with the operations performed.
