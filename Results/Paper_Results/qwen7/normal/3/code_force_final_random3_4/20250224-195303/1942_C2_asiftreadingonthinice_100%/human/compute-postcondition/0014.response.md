Output State: **`tmp` contains the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, `i` is 1, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `i` is 1 and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, the value appended to `tmp` is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. The initial conditions that `len(a)` must be at least 2 and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even remain valid. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
