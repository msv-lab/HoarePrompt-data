Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `ans` is `x + y - 1` or `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing either 1 or the value `(a[5] - a[4]) // 2`, and `i` is 5. If `(a[5] - a[4]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` is updated to contain the value `(a[5] - a[4]) // 2`; otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.
