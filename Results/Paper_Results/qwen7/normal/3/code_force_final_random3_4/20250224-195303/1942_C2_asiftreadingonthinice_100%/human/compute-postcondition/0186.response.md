Postcondition: `tmp` must contain at least one element. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is the original value of `y` minus `(i - 1)`, and `ans` is incremented by `i`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, then `y` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
