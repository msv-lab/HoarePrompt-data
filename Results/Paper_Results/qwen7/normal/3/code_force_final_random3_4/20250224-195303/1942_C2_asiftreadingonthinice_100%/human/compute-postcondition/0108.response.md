Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`, `ans` will be the count of consecutive elements with a difference of 2 plus the count of pairs of elements with an even difference that is not 2, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2.
