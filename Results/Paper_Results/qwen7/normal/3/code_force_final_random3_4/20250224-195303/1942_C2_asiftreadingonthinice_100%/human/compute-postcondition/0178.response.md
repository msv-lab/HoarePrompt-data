Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given information, `i` is equal to `len(a)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `tmp`. For the loop to execute, `tmp` must contain at least one element.

4. **Check the relationship between `i` and `tmp`**: Since `i` is initialized to `len(a)`, and the loop iterates over `tmp`, `i` will take on the values present in `tmp` during each iteration. Therefore, `i` must be able to take on the values present in `tmp` for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: The initial state of `i` is `len(a)`, but for the loop to execute, `i` must be able to take on the values present in `tmp`. This means `tmp` must contain at least one element.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `tmp` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`tmp` must contain at least one element**
