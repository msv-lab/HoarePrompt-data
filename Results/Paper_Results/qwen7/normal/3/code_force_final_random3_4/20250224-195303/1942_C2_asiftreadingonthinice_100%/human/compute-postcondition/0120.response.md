Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least one element, and `ans` is updated as follows: if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is incremented by `i` and `y` is decremented by `i - 1`; otherwise, `y` is less than `i - 1` and `ans` remains unchanged.
