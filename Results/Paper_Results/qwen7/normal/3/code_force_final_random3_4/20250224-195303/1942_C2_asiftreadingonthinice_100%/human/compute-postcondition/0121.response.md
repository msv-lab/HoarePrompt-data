Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in tmp`. The variables involved here are `i` and `tmp`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `i` is equal to `len(a)`.
   - `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least one element.
   - `ans` is updated based on the condition involving `y` and `i - 1`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `tmp`, the variable `i` will take on the values from the list `tmp` one by one.
   - The variable `tmp` itself does not change within the loop; it is the iterator `i` that changes.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be the first element of `tmp` (since it starts iterating from the beginning).
   - `tmp` remains the same sorted list with at least one element.

5. **Postcondition Adjustment:**
   - The postcondition for the loop is not directly relevant to the adjustment of the loop head variables. It pertains to what happens inside the loop body but does not affect the loop head variables.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` will be the first element of `tmp`.
- `tmp` remains the same sorted list with at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is the first element of `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least one element, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
