Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `tmp`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `tmp`.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - **Variable `i`**: According to the postcondition, `i` is the next element in `tmp` after `i_end` from the previous iteration.
   - **List `tmp`**: Since the loop is iterating over `tmp`, the list itself does not change within the loop (it is consumed element by element). However, we need to ensure that `tmp` still contains elements for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - **`i`**: The value of `i` will be the next element in `tmp` after `i_end` from the previous iteration.
   - **`tmp`**: For the loop to execute again, `tmp` must still contain elements. Therefore, `tmp` should be a non-empty list.

5. **Postcondition Adjustments**:
   - The postcondition states that `ans` is updated based on the value of `i` and `y`. This update happens inside the loop body, but the loop itself requires `tmp` to be non-empty to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `i` is the next element in `tmp` after `i_end`.
- `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is the next element in `tmp` after `i_end`, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list**.
