Output State: **`i` is `len(a) - 1 - 1`; `ans` is `ans + (len(a) - 1)`; `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list; the current value of `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is `len(a) - 1`. So, `ans` becomes `ans + (len(a) - 1)`. The value of `i` is decremented by 1 because `i -= 1` is implied by `ans += i` when `i` is used directly in the addition. The other variables (`tmp` and `y`) remain unchanged as they were not directly affected by the given code snippet.
