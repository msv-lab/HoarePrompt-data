Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, `tmp` will be a list containing elements that satisfy the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` when `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, `ans` will be the count of consecutive elements with a difference of 2 plus the count of pairs of elements with an even difference that is not 2.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the length of the list `a`, indicating that every element in `a` has been processed. The list `tmp` will contain half the differences between consecutive elements of `a` that are even but not equal to 2. The variable `ans` will hold the total count of such occurrences, specifically, it will count each instance where two consecutive elements differ by exactly 2, and also count each pair of elements where their difference is an even number but not 2.
