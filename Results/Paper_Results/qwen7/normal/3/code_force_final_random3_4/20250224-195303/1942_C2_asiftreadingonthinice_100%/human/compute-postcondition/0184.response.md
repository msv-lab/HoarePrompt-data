Output State: **`tmp` contains at least one element, and `y` is less than `i - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of `tmp` or `y`. Therefore, `tmp` still contains at least one element, and `y` is still less than `i - 1`.
