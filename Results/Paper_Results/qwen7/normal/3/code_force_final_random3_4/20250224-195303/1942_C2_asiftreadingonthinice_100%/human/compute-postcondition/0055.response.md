Output State: **`i` is the next element in `tmp` after `i_end`, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `i` or `tmp`. Instead, it indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial state, the only change is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional structure it was in.
