Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1` because `i` starts at `1` and goes up to but does not include `len(a)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `len(a)` is greater than 0.
   - If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is 1.
   - Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2.
   - If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 != 0`, then `tmp` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts from `1` and increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `2`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `2`.
   - `len(a)` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - We need to check the condition for `i = 2`:
     - If `a[2] - a[1] == 2`, then `ans` will be updated to `1`.
     - Otherwise, if `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` will contain the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and `a[2] - a[1]` will not be equal to `2`.
     - If `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 != 0`, then `tmp` will remain unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is 2.
- `len(a)` is still greater than 0.
- The values of `ans` and `tmp` depend on the new condition for `i = 2`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `len(a)` is greater than 0, and the values of `ans` and `tmp` depend on the condition `a[2] - a[1]`**.
