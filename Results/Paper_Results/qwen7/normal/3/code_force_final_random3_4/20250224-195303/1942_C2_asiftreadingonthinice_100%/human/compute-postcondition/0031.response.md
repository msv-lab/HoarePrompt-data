Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `ans` is 2 if `a[3] - a[2]` equals 2, otherwise `tmp` is a list containing the element \(((a[3] - a[2]) // 2)\) if \(a[3] - a[2]\) is even; if \(a[3] - a[2]\) is odd, `tmp` remains unchanged; `tmp` is updated by appending \((a[3] - a[2]) // 2\) if \(a[3] - a[2]\) is even.
