Output State: **`tmp` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `tmp`, `y` is decreased by `i - 1`, and `ans` is increased by the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `y -= i - 1` subtracts `i - 1` from `y`. The value of `i` is the second element of `tmp`. The variable `ans` is increased by the value of `i` from the previous iteration, but this increase is not directly affected by the current line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `y` and the unchanged state of `ans` from the previous iteration.
