Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is described as follows:
   - `tmp` must contain at least one element.
   - If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is the original value of `y` minus `(i - 1)`, and `ans` is incremented by `i`.
   - If `y` is less than `i - 1`, then `y` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in tmp:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `tmp`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is taken from `tmp`, `i` will be the first (or some other) element of `tmp` at the start of the current iteration.
   - `tmp` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. After the loop runs, `tmp` might change depending on the operations inside the loop.

Given these points, we need to determine how the state should be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop. 

- `i` will be set to the first element of `tmp` at the start of the next iteration.
- `tmp` might be modified inside the loop, but since we don't know the exact operations, we assume it still contains at least one element for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect:
- `i` being the first element of `tmp`.
- `tmp` containing at least one element.

**State:**
- `tmp` must contain at least one element.
- `i` is the first element of `tmp`.

So, the final state is:
**State: **`tmp` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element of `tmp`**.
