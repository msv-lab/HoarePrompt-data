Output State: **`tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list except for the appended value, `i` is 2, `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given the precondition that `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, the value being appended to `tmp` is an integer. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from 1 to 2. All other variables retain their original values.
