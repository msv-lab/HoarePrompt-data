Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the iterable `array`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j`: This is the loop variable that will take on the values from the iterable `array`.
   - `array`: This is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting to integers.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `array` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `array`.
   - The initial value of `j` will be the first element of `array`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `j` will take on the values from `array`, the first value of `j` will be the first element of `array`.
   - Therefore, `array` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `k + 2`
- `input_value` must be greater than `k + 2`
- `l` is updated to the value of `int(input())`
- `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0
- `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting to integers
- `ans` is an empty string

We need to ensure that `array` contains at least one element for the loop to execute. The other variables (`i`, `input_value`, `l`, `s`, `ans`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`array` must contain at least one element**
