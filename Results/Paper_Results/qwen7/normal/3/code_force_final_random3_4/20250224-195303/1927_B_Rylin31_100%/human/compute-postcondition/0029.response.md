Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `j` from the `array`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the `array` that have not been processed.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`
   - `l` is an input integer
   - `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0
   - `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`
   - `ans` is a string with the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` appended to it twice
   - `j` is the second element of the `array`
   - `s[j]` is incremented by 1, and `s[j]` is now one more than its previous value

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the second element of the `array`, the loop will continue if there are more elements in the `array`.
   - After processing `j`, the next value of `j` will be the next element in the `array`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` remains `k + 1` because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `input_value` remains greater than `k + 1` because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `l` remains the same because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `s` remains a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `array` loses the first element (which was `j`), and the next element becomes the new `j`.
   - `ans` remains the same because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `j` changes to the next element in the `array`.
   - `s[j]` is incremented by 1, and `s[j]` is now one more than its previous value.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `k + 1`
- `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`
- `l` is an input integer
- `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0
- `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, but now the first element is removed (the previous `j`), and the next element becomes the new `j`.
- `ans` is a string with the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` appended to it twice
- `j` is the next element in the `array` (the element after the previous `j`)
- `s[j]` is incremented by 1, and `s[j]` is now one more than its previous value

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, but now the first element is removed (the previous `j`), and the next element becomes the new `j`, `ans` is a string with the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` appended to it twice, `j` is the next element in the `array` (the element after the previous `j`), `s[j]` is incremented by 1, and `s[j]` is now one more than its previous value**
