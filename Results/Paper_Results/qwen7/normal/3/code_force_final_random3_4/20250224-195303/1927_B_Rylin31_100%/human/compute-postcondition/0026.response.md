Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in array:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`
   - `l` is an input integer
   - `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0
   - `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`
   - `ans` is a string with the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` appended to it
   - `j` is the first element of the `array`
   - `s[j]` is incremented by 1

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `j` in `array`, the value of `j` will change in each iteration.
   - The current value of `j` is the first element of the `array`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be set to the next element in the `array`.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `i` remains `k + 1` because it is not part of the loop head.
- `input_value` must still be greater than `k + 1` because it is not part of the loop head.
- `l` remains the same because it is not part of the loop head.
- `s` remains the same because it is not part of the loop head.
- `array` remains the same because it is not part of the loop head.
- `ans` remains the same because it is not part of the loop head.
- `j` changes to the next element in the `array`.
- `s[j]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `ans` is a string with the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` appended to it, `j` is the second element of the `array`, `s[j]` is incremented by 1**
