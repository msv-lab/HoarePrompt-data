Based on the initial state described:

- `array` is a list of integers, but its exact contents are not specified.
- `s` is a list of integers where each element has been incremented by the number of times the loop has executed.
- `ans` is a string that concatenates characters based on the incremented values in `s`.
- `i`, `input_value`, `l`, and the initial state of `s` remain unchanged.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process:

1. **Incrementing `s`:** Each element in `s` is incremented by the number of times the loop has executed. Since the loop runs `len(array)` times, each element in `s` will be incremented by `len(array)`.

2. **Concatenating characters to `ans`:** For each iteration of the loop, the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` (where `j` is an element from `array`) is appended to `ans`.

Given these steps, the value of `ans` will be constructed by taking the incremented values in `s` and converting them to characters using the formula `s[j] + 97`.

Since the exact values of `array` and the initial state of `s` are not provided, we can only describe the general form of `ans` based on the incrementation and conversion process.

Output: **a string constructed by converting the incremented values in `s` to characters using the formula `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`**
