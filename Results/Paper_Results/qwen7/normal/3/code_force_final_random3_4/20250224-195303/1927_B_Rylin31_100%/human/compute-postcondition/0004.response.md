Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is the integer input value, `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `t`, `l`, `s`, and `array` remain unchanged from their initial states.
