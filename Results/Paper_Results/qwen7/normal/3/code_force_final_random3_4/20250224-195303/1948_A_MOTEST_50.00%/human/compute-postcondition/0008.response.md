Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 1; `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and only `ans` is now an empty string.
