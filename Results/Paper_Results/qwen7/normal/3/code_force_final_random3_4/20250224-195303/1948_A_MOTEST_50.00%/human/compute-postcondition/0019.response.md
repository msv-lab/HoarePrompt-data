Output State: **`j` is 3, `x` is increased by 1**.

The value of `j` remains unchanged at 3. The variable `x` is incremented by 1, but its original value was not specified, so we only know that `x` has been increased by 1. The expression `ans` is `ans` + 2 * `s[x]` is not evaluated because `s` is not defined, and no assignment to `ans` is made. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.
