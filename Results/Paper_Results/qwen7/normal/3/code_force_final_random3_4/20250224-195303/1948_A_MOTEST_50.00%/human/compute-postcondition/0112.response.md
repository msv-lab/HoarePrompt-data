Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases specified by `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string `ans` based on the value of `n`. If `n` is even, `ans` consists of pairs of characters from the uppercase alphabet string `s`, up to `n // 2` characters. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' followed by pairs of characters from `s`, up to `n // 2 - 1` characters. After processing all test cases, it prints 'YES' and the constructed string `ans` for each valid `n`.**
