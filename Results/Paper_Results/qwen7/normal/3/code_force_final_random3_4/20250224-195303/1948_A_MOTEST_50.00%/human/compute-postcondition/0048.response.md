Output State: **`i` is 1 more than its previous value, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0 plus 2 times `s[x]`, `x` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Given that `x` was initially 0, after executing the code, `x` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
