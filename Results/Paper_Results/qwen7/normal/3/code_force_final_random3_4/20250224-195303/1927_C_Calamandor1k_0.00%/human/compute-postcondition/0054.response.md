Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split, `b` is a list of integers from the new input split, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `count_a` and `count_b`, both to 0. The lengths of lists `a` and `b`, along with the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, remain unchanged from their initial states.
