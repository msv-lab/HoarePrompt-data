Postcondition: `count_a` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and `i` is within the range (0, `len_a`], otherwise `count_a` remains unchanged. `count_b` remains 0. `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, `d`, and `i` retain their original values except that `i` is now 1. Additionally, `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`.
