Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `a`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are still assigned their original values from the initial state, which are the first three integers from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.
