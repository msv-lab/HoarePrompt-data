Based on the initial state provided:

- `d = k // 2`
- `a` is a list of integers from the input split
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split
- `b` is a list of integers from the new input split
- `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be at least 1
- `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be at least 1
- `count_a` is the total number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`
- `count_b` is the total number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`
- `i` is the maximum of `len_a` and `len_b`

The condition in the `print` statement checks if `count_a` is greater than or equal to `d` and `count_b` is greater than or equal to `d`. 

Given that `d = k // 2`, the condition simplifies to checking if `count_a` and `count_b` are both greater than or equal to `k // 2`.

Since `count_a` and `count_b` represent the counts of elements in lists `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, and assuming that these counts are non-negative integers, the result of the condition will depend on the values of `count_a` and `count_b`.

If both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `k // 2`, the output will be "YES". Otherwise, it will be "NO".

Output: **YES** if `count_a` >= `k // 2` and `count_b` >= `k // 2`, otherwise **NO**.
