Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), along with two lists \( a \) and \( b \). For each test case, it checks if the number of elements in lists \( a \) and \( b \) that are less than or equal to \( k/2 \) meet certain criteria. If both lists meet the criteria, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.**
