Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) and returns them in descending order, followed by their corresponding quotients.
   - This part of the code is correct and works as intended.

2. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The main logic checks if there are any possible values of `k` that satisfy the conditions given the position `n` and the number `x`.
   - The expression `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that the total length of the settling cycle is even, which is necessary for the settling pattern to repeat properly.
   - The expression `(n - x) % 2 == 0` ensures that the position `n` is within the bounds where the settling pattern can be applied.
   - The use of `func_1` to find divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` is appropriate for determining the possible values of `k`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The output is stored in a set to remove duplicates, ensuring that each value of `k` is counted only once.
   - The final output is converted to a list before printing, which is correct.

Given the execution summary and the analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct output based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
