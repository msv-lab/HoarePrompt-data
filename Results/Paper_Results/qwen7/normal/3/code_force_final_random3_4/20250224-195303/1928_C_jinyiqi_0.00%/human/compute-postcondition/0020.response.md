The code `output1.reverse()` reverses the list `output1`. Before the reversal, `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) in ascending order. After reversing, these divisors will be in descending order. The value of `x`, `i`, and `output2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is the largest integer such that \(i^2 \leq x\), `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\) in descending order, and `output2` is a list containing the corresponding quotients of `x` divided by each divisor in `output1` in the same order.**
