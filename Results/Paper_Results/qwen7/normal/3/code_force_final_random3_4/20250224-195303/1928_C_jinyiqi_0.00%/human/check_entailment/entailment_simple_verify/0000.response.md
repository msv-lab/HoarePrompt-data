### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding
The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) based on Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received during the settling \( x \). The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

#### Key Points from the Annotated Code
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a specific order.
   - It correctly identifies all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a list where the divisors are sorted in descending order and then concatenated with their corresponding quotients.
3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - If \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \): This condition is used to check if \( n + x - 2 \) is even.
     - If \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \): This condition is used to check if \( n - x \) is even.
   - For each valid \( k \) derived from the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \), it checks if the derived \( k \) satisfies the condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).
   - The results are stored in a set to ensure uniqueness.

#### Analysis of the Given Test Cases
Let's verify the given test cases with the provided solution:

1. **Test Case: `10 2`**
   - \( n = 10 \), \( x = 2 \)
   - \( n + x - 2 = 10 \)
   - \( n - x = 8 \)
   - Divisors of 10: \( [10, 5, 2, 1] \)
   - Divisors of 8: \( [8, 4, 2, 1] \)
   - Valid \( k \) values: \( 2, 5, 6, 10 \)

2. **Test Case: `3 1`**
   - \( n = 3 \), \( x = 1 \)
   - \( n + x - 2 = 2 \)
   - \( n - x = 2 \)
   - Divisors of 2: \( [2, 1] \)
   - Valid \( k \) value: \( 2 \)

3. **Test Case: `76 4`**
   - \( n = 76 \), \( x = 4 \)
   - \( n + x - 2 = 78 \)
   - \( n - x = 72 \)
   - Divisors of 78: \( [78, 39, 26, 13, 6, 3, 2, 1] \)
   - Divisors of 72: \( [72, 36, 24, 18, 16, 12, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1] \)
   - Valid \( k \) values: \( 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 16, 18, 24, 36, 39, 72, 78 \)

4. **Test Case: `100 99`**
   - \( n = 100 \), \( x = 99 \)
   - \( n + x - 2 = 198 \)
   - \( n - x = 1 \)
   - Divisors of 198: \( [198, 99, 59, 33, 18, 11, 6, 3, 2, 1] \)
   - Divisors of 1: \( [1] \)
   - No valid \( k \) values

5. **Test Case: `1000000000 500000000`**
   - \( n = 1000000000 \), \( x = 500000000 \)
   - \( n + x - 2 = 1500000000 \)
   - \( n - x = 500000000 \)
   - Divisors of 1500000000: \( [1500000000, 750000000, 300000000, 250000000, 150000000, 100000000, 75000000, 50000000, 30000000, 25000000, 15000000, 10000000, 7500000, 5000000, 3000000, 2500000, 1500000, 1000000, 750000, 500000, 300000, 250000, 150000, 100000, 75000, 50000, 30000, 25000, 15000, 10000, 7500, 5000, 3000, 2500, 1500, 1000, 750, 500, 300, 250, 150, 100, 75, 50, 30, 25, 15, 10, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] \)
