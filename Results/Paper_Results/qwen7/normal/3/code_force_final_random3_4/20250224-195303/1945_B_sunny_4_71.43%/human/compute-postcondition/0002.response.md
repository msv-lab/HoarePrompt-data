Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0, while `a`, `b`, and `m` are now specific input integers.
