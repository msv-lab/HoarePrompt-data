Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State:
   - `t` is 1.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

2. The `print(A + B)` statement will add the values of `A` and `B` and print the result.

3. Since `A` and `B` are both calculated based on the value of `m` divided by `a` and `b` respectively, and then incremented by 1, the exact values depend on the inputs `a`, `b`, and `m`.

4. Therefore, the output will be the sum of `A` and `B`, where:
   - `A = int(m / a) + 1`
   - `B = int(m / b) + 1`

Final Output:
Output: **int(m / a) + int(m / b) + 2**
