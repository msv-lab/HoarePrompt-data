Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `A` is equal to `int(m // a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`. The value of `m` is unchanged, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers. The value of `A` was previously calculated as `int(m // a) + 1`. The output state includes all the initial conditions and the new value of `B`.
