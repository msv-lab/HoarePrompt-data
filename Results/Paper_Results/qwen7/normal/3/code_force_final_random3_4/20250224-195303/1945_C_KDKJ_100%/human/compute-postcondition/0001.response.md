Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and no changes have been made to `n` by the function `func_1()`**.

Explanation: The code snippet only calls the function `func_1()`, but the function itself is not defined. Since there is no definition for `func_1()`, no changes are made to the variable `n`. Therefore, `n` remains an integer within the specified range.
