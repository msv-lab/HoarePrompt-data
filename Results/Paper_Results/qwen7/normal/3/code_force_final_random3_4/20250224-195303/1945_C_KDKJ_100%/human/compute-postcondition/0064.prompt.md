Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is -1, `n` is at least 1, `s` is the last character of the string `a`, `x` is the count of '0's in the string `a`, `y` is the count of '1's in the string `a`, and `S` is a list containing all the intermediate states `[x, y]` for each character in the string `a`, starting from `[0, 0]` and updating with each iteration based on whether the current character is '0' or '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = i
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - i
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, and `ans` is either 0 or the value that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, ensuring that the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` still holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 2, `left` remains as `S[i][0]`, `lsum` remains as `i`, `right` remains as `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` remains as `n - i`, and `ans` is updated to `i` if the new `i` provides a smaller absolute difference with `n / 2`, while maintaining the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2; `left` equals `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`; `ans` remains unchanged unless the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, in which case `ans` is updated to `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
