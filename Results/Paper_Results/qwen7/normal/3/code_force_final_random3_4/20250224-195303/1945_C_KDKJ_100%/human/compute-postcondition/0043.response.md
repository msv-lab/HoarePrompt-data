Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`. This means that `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, and `ans` is either 0 or the value that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, ensuring that the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` still holds true.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

5. **Update the other variables based on the new value of `i`**:
   - `lsum` remains 0 because it does not depend on `i`.
   - `rsum` will now be `n - (i + 1)`.
   - `ans` may change if the loop body updates it, but we don't know the exact update without seeing the loop body. However, we know it should still satisfy the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)`.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `rsum` becomes `n - (i + 1)`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (i + 1)`, and `ans` is either 0 or the value that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, ensuring that the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` still holds true.**
