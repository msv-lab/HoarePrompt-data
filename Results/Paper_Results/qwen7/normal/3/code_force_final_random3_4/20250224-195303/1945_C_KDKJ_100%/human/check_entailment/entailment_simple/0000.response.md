### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the road are satisfied. This involves checking the balance of '0's (left preference) and '1's (right preference) on both sides of the chosen position.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: 
     - Reads the number of houses `n` and the preferences string `a`.
     - Uses a list `S` to keep track of the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each house.
     - Iterates through each possible position `i` to check if placing the road there satisfies the condition (`left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`).
     - Updates the best position `ans` that minimizes the absolute difference `|n / 2 - i|` while satisfying the conditions.
   - **func_2**:
     - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Key Checks**:
   - The code correctly initializes and updates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
   - It iterates through each possible position `i` and checks the conditions for both sides.
   - It updates the best position `ans` based on the conditions and the minimization of `|n / 2 - i|`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house (`i = 0`) or after the last house (`i = n`).

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the problem requirements.
   - The loop in `func_2` ensures that each test case is processed independently.
   - The conditions checked in the loop are accurate and sufficient to find the optimal position.

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.
