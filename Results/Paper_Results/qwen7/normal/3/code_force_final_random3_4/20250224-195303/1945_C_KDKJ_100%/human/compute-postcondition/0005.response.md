Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\)**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no specific implementation of `func_1()` is provided, no changes are made to the variables. The precondition that `n` is an integer within the specified range remains unchanged.
