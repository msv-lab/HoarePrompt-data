The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2; `left` equals `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`; `ans` remains unchanged.**
