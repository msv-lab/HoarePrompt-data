You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of houses, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident prefers to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident prefers to live on the right side.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        x, y = S[-1]
        
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        
        S.append([x, y])
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `n` is at least 1, `s` is the last character of the string `a`, `x` is the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `S` plus the number of '0's in `a`, `y` is the sum of the second elements of all sublists in `S` plus the number of '1's in `a`, and `S` is a list containing all the sublists generated during the iterations of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` remains at least 1, `s` will be the last character of the string `a`. The variable `x` will be the count of '0's in the string `a`, and `y` will be the count of '1's in the string `a`. The list `S` will contain all the intermediate states `[x, y]` for each character in the string `a`, starting from `[0, 0]` and updating with each iteration based on whether the current character is '0' or '1'.
    ans = -1
    for i in range(n + 1):
        left = S[i][0]
        
        lsum = i
        
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        
        rsum = n - i
        
        if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
            continue
        elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
            ans = i
        
    #State: The final value of `ans` is the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, while satisfying the conditions `(left * 2 >= lsum)` and `(right * 2 >= rsum)` for all iterations of the loop.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (the index i that minimizes |n/2 - ans| and satisfies (left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum) for all iterations)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of houses, and `a`, a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The function returns whether it's possible to arrange the residents such that all residents who prefer to live on the left side are on the left and all residents who prefer to live on the right side are on the right.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
