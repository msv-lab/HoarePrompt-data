Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the optimal position \( i \) to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the road are satisfied, and the position is as close to the middle of the village as possible.
2. The provided solution consists of two functions:
   - `func_1`: This function takes an integer `n` and a string `a` as input. It calculates the cumulative counts of '0's (left side) and '1's (right side) up to each position and checks if placing the road at each position satisfies the conditions. If it does, it updates the optimal position `i`.
   - `func_2`: This function is a wrapper that handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it calls `func_1`.

3. The execution summary for `func_1` indicates that it correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position \( i \). It iterates through all possible positions, checks the conditions, and updates the optimal position accordingly.
4. The execution summary for `func_2` correctly describes its role as a wrapper function that calls `func_1` for each test case.

Given that both functions work as intended and correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
