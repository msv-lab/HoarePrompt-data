Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (which is already given).
   - The variable `i` starts at 0.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, we need to ensure `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be at least 1, as stated in the problem.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**
