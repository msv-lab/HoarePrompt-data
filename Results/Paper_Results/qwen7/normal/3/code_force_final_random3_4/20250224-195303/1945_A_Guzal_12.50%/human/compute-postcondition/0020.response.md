Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 or 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is incremented by 1. Initially, `k` was calculated as `a + (b + c) // 3`. After executing `k += 1`, `k` now becomes `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
