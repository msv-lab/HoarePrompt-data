Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `n` is an input integer. We need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the value of `n`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since the loop depends on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts, as `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
