Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 or 1, after the first iteration, `i` will become 1 or 2 respectively.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain greater than 0.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value (0 or 1), so it will be 1 or 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 or 2**
