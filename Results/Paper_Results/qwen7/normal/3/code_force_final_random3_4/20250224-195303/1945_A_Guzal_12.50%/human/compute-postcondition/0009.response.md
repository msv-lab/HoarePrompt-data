Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is incremented by 1. Initially, `k` was calculated as `a + (b + c) // 3`. Since `b + c` is not divisible by 3, `(b + c) // 3` gives the quotient when `b + c` is divided by 3. After incrementing `k` by 1, the new value of `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
