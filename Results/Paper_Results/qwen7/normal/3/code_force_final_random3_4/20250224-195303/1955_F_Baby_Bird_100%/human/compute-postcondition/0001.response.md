Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a sequence defined by four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, where the total count t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. It returns a specific value or result based on the given counts.**
