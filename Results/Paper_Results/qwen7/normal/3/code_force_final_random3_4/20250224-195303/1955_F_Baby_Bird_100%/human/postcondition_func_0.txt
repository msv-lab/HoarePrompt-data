The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on these counts, divides the sum by 3, and prints the result. The function reads the number of test cases from the first line of input and the counts for each test case from subsequent lines.
