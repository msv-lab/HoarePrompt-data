Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem statement, the goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins by ensuring the final XOR of the sequence is zero. The function instead performs a different calculation that does not relate to the XOR operation or the optimal removal strategy.

The function `func` reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates a value using the formula `sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3`. This formula does not reflect the logic needed to determine the maximum number of Bob's wins based on the XOR condition.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero after each removal. The key observation is that the XOR of the sequence should be zero at the end for Bob to win. We need to count the parity (odd or even) of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s and use this information to determine the maximum number of Bob's wins.

Given the incorrect implementation, the provided function does not achieve the desired outcome.

Correctness: **False**
