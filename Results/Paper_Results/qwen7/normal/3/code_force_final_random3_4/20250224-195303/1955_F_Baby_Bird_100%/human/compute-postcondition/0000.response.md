Let's break down the code step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, there are four non-negative integers \(p_i\) (where \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\)) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
       enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The code takes an integer input, which represents the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it takes another input, which is a space-separated string of four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It then processes this input to calculate a value and prints it.

4. **Calculation Inside the Loop**:
   - `input().split()` reads the input as a list of strings.
   - `map(int, input().split())` converts these strings into integers.
   - `enumerate(map(int, input().split()))` gives us the index and the integer value for each count.
   - The expression inside the `sum` function calculates a value for each count:
     - `x // 2` gives the integer division of the count by 2.
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder when the count is divided by 2.
     - `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)`:
       - If `i < 3`, it multiplies the remainder by 1 (since `i < 3` is true for indices 0, 1, and 2).
       - Otherwise, it multiplies the remainder by 0 (since `i < 3` is false for index 3).
   - This sum is then divided by 3 and converted to a string.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The results for each test case are joined with newline characters and printed.

Given the initial state and the code, the output will be the result of the calculation for each test case, formatted as a single string with newlines between each result.

Output: **the result of the calculation for each test case, separated by newlines (where the result for each test case is the sum of the processed counts divided by 3, formatted as a string)**
