Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, `b` are integers inputted from the user, `s` is `s - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `sp` is the element at index `s` in list `a`, `bp` is the element at index `b` in list `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`**.

In this output state, the variable `bm` is assigned the value of `a[b] * k`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or values derived from the initial state.
