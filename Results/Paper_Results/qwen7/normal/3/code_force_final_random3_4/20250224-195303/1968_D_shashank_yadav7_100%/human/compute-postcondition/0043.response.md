Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. Since `s` is defined as `p[s] - 2`, the new value of `sp` becomes `a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
