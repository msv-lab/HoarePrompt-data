Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is `n - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is updated to the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`**

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increases the value of `bp` by `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
