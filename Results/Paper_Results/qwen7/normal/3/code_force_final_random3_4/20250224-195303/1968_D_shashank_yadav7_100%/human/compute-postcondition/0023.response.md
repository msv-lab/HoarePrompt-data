Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p[b]` is decreased by 1 and `b` is updated to reflect this change.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `s` is `p[s] - 1`.
   - `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`).
   - `sp` is increased by `a[s]`.
   - `bp` is increased by `a[b]`.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `n`, we need to update these variables.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such information is provided, we assume `n` stays the same.

4. **Update the other variables**:
   - `p[b]` is already adjusted by the previous iteration.
   - `b` is also adjusted by the previous iteration.
   - `k` remains 0 as there is no indication that `k` should change.
   - `s` remains `p[s] - 1` as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `sm` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `sp` and `bp` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the loop.

Given the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be the same as before**
