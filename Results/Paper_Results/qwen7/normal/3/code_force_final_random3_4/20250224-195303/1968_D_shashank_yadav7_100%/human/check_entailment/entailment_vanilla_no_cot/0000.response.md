Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Position Adjustment**: It adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to zero-based indices.
3. **Initial Scores Calculation**: It calculates the initial scores for both players based on their starting positions.
4. **Game Loop**: It simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the positions and scores for both players. It uses a loop to simulate each turn, updating the positions according to the permutation `p` and recalculating the maximum possible scores for both players.
5. **Result Determination**: After simulating the game, it compares the final scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

The logic within the loop ensures that the players' scores are updated correctly based on their moves and the permutation, and the final comparison of scores is accurate. Therefore, the program is correct.
