Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `b` is `p[b] - 1`
   - `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`
   - `k` is `0`
   - `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * 0 + bp`
   - `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * 0 + sp`
   - `sp` is `a[s] + sp`
   - `bp` is `a[b] + bp`
   - `bm` is greater than `sm`

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('Bodya')`.

Given the print statement, it directly outputs the string `'Bodya'`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `k`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) are not relevant to the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **Bodya**
