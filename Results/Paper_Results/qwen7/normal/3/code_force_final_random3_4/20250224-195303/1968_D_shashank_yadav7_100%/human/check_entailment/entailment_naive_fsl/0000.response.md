Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **Score Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible score for both Bodya and Sasha using the formula `a[x] * k + a[p[x]]` for each turn. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the game dynamics because the players can choose to stay at their current position or move to `p[x]` during each turn. The program assumes that both players will always move to `p[x]`, which is not necessarily true.

2. **Staying vs Moving**: The program does not consider the scenario where a player might choose to stay at their current position instead of moving to `p[x]`. This is crucial because the player's decision to stay or move can significantly affect the final score.

3. **Example Case**: Consider the following input:
   ```
   1
   2 2 1 2
   2 1
   3 2
   ```
   - **Initial Positions**: Bodya starts at position 1, Sasha starts at position 2.
   - **Permutation**: `[2, 1]`
   - **Array**: `[3, 2]`

   Let's walk through the game:
   - **First Turn**:
     - Bodya: Position 1, Score = 3 (stays at position 1).
     - Sasha: Position 2, Score = 2 (moves to position 1).
   - **Second Turn**:
     - Bodya: Position 1, Score = 3 + 3 = 6 (stays at position 1).
     - Sasha: Position 1, Score = 2 + 2 = 4 (stays at position 1).

   Final scores: Bodya = 6, Sasha = 4. Therefore, Bodya wins.

   However, the program would incorrectly calculate the scores as follows:
   - Bodya: `max(3 * 2 + 3, 3 * 1 + 3) = 9`
   - Sasha: `max(2 * 2 + 2, 2 * 1 + 2) = 6`

   In this case, the program incorrectly concludes that Sasha wins, which is not the correct outcome.

Given this analysis, the program does not handle all possible scenarios correctly and fails to account for the player's choice to stay or move. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
