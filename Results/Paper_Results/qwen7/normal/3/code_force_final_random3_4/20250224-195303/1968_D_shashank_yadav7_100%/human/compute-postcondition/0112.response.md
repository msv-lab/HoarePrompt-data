Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits it into a list using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the list `a` is updated with these integers, but none of the other variables (`k`, `s`, `n`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `b`, `s`, `p`) are directly affected by this operation. The values of `b` and `s` are also updated to `p[b] - 2` and `p[s] - 2` respectively, but since `p` is not defined before this line, `b` and `s` remain as they were initially.
