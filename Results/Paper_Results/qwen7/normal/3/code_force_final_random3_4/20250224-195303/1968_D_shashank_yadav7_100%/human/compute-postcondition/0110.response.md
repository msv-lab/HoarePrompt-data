The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `b`, while `s` is also updated. Since the initial values of `k` and `s` are `-2` and `1` respectively, and the initial values of `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `b`, and `s` are derived from the maximum value expressions involving `a` and other variables, these expressions remain unchanged unless explicitly updated.

After executing the code, the values of `k` and `s` are updated to the values read from the input. The other variables (`bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `b`, and `a`) remain in their initial states because they are not directly modified by the code.

Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`.**
