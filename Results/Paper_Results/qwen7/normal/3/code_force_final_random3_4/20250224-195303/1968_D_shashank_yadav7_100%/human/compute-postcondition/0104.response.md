Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `k = -2`
   - `i = 0`
   - `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`
   - `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`
   - `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`
   - `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`
   - `b` is `p[b] - 2`
   - `s` is `p[s] - 2`
   - `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`
   - `bm` is updated to the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`
   - `sm` is updated to the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`
   - `bp` is increased by `a[b]`
   - `bm` is not greater than `sm`, but `bm` is less than `sm`

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated multiple times, but the final values depend on the values of `a[b]`, `a[s]`, `bp`, and `sp`.
   - The values of `b` and `s` are derived from `p[b]` and `p[s]` respectively, but their exact values are not provided.
   - The print statement does not reference any variables that have been updated or calculated in the operations above.

Given these observations, the print statement `print('Sasha')` will simply print the string "Sasha".

Output: **Sasha**
