Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` must be greater than 0.
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`.
- `k` is `0`.
- `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * 0 + bp`.
- `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * 0 + sp`.
- `sp` is `a[s] + sp`.
- `bp` is `a[b] + bp`.
- The condition `bm < sm` holds true.

The print statement is `print('Sasha')`.

The output does not depend on the values of the other variables because the print statement directly outputs the string 'Sasha'. Therefore, the value printed is simply the string 'Sasha'.

Output: **Sasha**
