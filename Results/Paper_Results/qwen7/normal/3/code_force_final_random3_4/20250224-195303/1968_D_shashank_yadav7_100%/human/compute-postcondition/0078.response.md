Output State: **`k` is -1, `i` is `n - 2`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * 0 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * 0 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to -1. The other variables (`i`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `i` remains `n - 2`, `bm` is still the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * 0 + bp` (which simplifies to `bm` and `bp`), `sm` is still the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * 0 + sp` (which simplifies to `bm` and `sp`), `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, and `bp` is increased by `a[b]`.
