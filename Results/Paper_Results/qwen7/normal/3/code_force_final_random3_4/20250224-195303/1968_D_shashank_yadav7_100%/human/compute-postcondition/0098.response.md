Output State: `i` is 0, `k` is -2, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 3`, `s` is `p[s] - 3`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is updated to the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` has reached 0, indicating the loop has completed its execution. The variable `k` has been decremented to -2. The variables `bm` and `sm` are updated with the maximum values considering the current state of `k`. The variable `sp` is incremented twice by `a[s]`, and `bp` is incremented twice by `a[b]`. Additionally, `b` and `s` are updated by subtracting 3 from their respective initial values after three iterations of the loop.
