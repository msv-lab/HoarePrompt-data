You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        bm = a[b] * k
        sm = a[s] * k
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \), and for each test case, it reads values for \( n \), \( k \), \( b \), and \( s \). It then takes a permutation \( p \) and an array \( a \) as inputs. The function calculates two values, \( bm \) and \( sm \), by iterating through the permutation and updating based on the values in the array \( a \). Finally, it compares \( bm \) and \( sm \) and prints either "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on their comparison.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Score Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible score for both Bodya and Sasha using the formula `a[x] * k + a[p[x]]` for each turn. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the game dynamics because the players can choose to stay at their current position or move to `p[x]` during each turn. The program assumes that both players will always move to `p[x]`, which is not necessarily true.

2. **Staying vs Moving**: The program does not consider the scenario where a player might choose to stay at their current position instead of moving to `p[x]`. This is crucial because the player's decision to stay or move can significantly affect the final score.

3. **Example Case**: Consider the following input:
   ```
   1
   2 2 1 2
   2 1
   3 2
   ```
   - **Initial Positions**: Bodya starts at position 1, Sasha starts at position 2.
   - **Permutation**: `[2, 1]`
   - **Array**: `[3, 2]`

   Let's walk through the game:
   - **First Turn**:
     - Bodya: Position 1, Score = 3 (stays at position 1).
     - Sasha: Position 2, Score = 2 (moves to position 1).
   - **Second Turn**:
     - Bodya: Position 1, Score = 3 + 3 = 6 (stays at position 1).
     - Sasha: Position 1, Score = 2 + 2 = 4 (stays at position 1).

   Final scores: Bodya = 6, Sasha = 4. Therefore, Bodya wins.

   However, the program would incorrectly calculate the scores as follows:
   - Bodya: `max(3 * 2 + 3, 3 * 1 + 3) = 9`
   - Sasha: `max(2 * 2 + 2, 2 * 1 + 2) = 6`

   In this case, the program incorrectly concludes that Sasha wins, which is not the correct outcome.

Given this analysis, the program does not handle all possible scenarios correctly and fails to account for the player's choice to stay or move. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
