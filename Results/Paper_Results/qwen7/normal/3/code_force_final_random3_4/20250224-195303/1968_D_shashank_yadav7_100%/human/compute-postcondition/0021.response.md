Output State: **`p[b]` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to reflect this change, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`)**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increases the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to reflect this change, `i` remains 1, `k` remains 0, `s` remains `p[s] - 1`, and `sm` remains `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. Since `k` is 0, `a[s] * k + sp` simplifies to just `sp`, so `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `sp`.
