Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is `n - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is updated to the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp**.

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to the maximum value between its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. Given that `k` is -2, `sm` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `a[s] * -2 + sp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
