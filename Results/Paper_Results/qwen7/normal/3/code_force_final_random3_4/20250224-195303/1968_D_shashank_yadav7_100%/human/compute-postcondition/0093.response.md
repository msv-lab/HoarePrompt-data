Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is `n - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -1 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -1 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, and `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `s = p[s] - 1` decrements the value of `s` by 1. Since `s` was previously `p[s] - 1`, now it becomes `p[s] - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
