Output State: **`k` is -1, `i` is `n - 2`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -1 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -1 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, and `sm` is updated to the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -1 + sp`.**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increases the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. Since `sp` was previously increased by `a[s]`, it is now increased by `a[s]` again, making it increased by `2 * a[s]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
