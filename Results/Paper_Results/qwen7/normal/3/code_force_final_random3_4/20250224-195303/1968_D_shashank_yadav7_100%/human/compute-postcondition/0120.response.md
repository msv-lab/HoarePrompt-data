Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0**

The value of `k` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state does not specify what `k` is, we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. However, we know that `i` was initially 0 and is now decremented by 1, making it -1. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
