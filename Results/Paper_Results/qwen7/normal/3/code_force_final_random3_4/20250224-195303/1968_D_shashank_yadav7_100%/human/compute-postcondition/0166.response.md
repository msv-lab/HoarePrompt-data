Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a. For each test case, it checks if t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4. It then verifies that n, k, P_B, and P_S meet the conditions 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. Finally, it processes a permutation p of length n and an array a of positive integers of length n.**

This description outlines the implicit nature of the parameters (t, n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a) and their respective constraints without detailing the internal operations of the function.
