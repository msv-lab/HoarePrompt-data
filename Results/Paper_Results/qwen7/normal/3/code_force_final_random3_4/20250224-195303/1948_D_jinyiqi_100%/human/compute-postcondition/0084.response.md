Output State: **`count` is an integer +1, `s` is a string, `k` is `k_prev + 1`, `j` is the same as before, the character at index `k_prev + 1` in `s` is neither a '?' nor is the character at index `(k_prev + 1) + j` a '?', and the characters at indices `k_prev + 1` and `(k_prev + 1) + j` in `s` are not the same.**

Explanation: The variable `count` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`s`, `k`, `j`, the specific characters at certain indices in `s`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
