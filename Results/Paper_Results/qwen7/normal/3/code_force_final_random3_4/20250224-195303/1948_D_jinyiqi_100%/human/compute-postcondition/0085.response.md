Output State: **`count` is 0, `s` is a string, `k` is `k_prev + 1`, `j` is the same as before, the character at index `k_prev + 1` in `s` is neither a '?', the character at index `(k_prev + 1) + j` in `s` is not a '?', and the characters at indices `k_prev + 1` and `(k_prev + 1) + j` in `s` are not the same.**

Explanation: The code sets `count` to 0. All other variables (`s`, `k`, `j`, the characters at specific indices in `s`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
