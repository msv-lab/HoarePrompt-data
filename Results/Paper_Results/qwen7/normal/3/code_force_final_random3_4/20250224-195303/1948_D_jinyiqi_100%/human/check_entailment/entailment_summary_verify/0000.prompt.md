You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s , consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or
question marks.

A tandem repeat is a string of an even length such that its first half is
equal to its second half.

A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b by the
deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and
several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

Your goal is to replace each question mark with some lowercase Latin letter in
such a way that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is
maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains a string s (1 \le |s| \le 5000 ),
consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.

The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed 5000 .

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum length of the longest
substring that is a tandem repeat after you replace each question mark in the
string with some lowercase Latin letter.

If it's impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, print 0
.

Example

Input

    4
    
    zaabaabz
    
    ?????
    
    code?????s
    
    codeforces

Output

    6
    4
    10
    0

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
    print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It checks for pairs of characters that are either equal or both question marks, starting from the middle of the string and moving towards the beginning. If it finds such a pair, it prints twice the length of the longest such sequence found and exits. If no such sequence is found, it prints 0. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the string consists entirely of question marks. For example, consider the input `?????`. The program should output `4` because we can replace the question marks to form the string `aaaaa`, which has a tandem repeat substring of length `4` (`aa` repeated twice). However, the current implementation will output `0` because it does not attempt to form any tandem repeat substrings.

To fix this, the program needs to check if it's possible to form a tandem repeat by replacing question marks and then attempt to do so. Here is a modified version of the function that should work correctly:

```python
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0
    
    # Try to form a tandem repeat by replacing question marks
    for i in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        for j in range(0, n - i):
            valid = True
            for k in range(j, j + i):
                if s[k] != '?' and s[k + i] != '?' and s[k] != s[k + i]:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                max_length = max(max_length, i * 2)
    
    print(max_length)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()
```

This version of the function tries to form tandem repeats by checking each possible length and ensuring that the characters match or are question marks. It updates `max_length` if a valid tandem repeat is found.
