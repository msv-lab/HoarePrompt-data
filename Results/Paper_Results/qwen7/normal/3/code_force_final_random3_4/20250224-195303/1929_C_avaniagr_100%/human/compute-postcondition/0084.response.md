Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, and `x - k + 3` must be at least 1; `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` and `z` is updated to its current value plus itself divided by `k-1` plus 1.**

This means that the value of `z` has been updated to its original value plus the integer division of `z` by `k-1` plus 1. The conditions for `k` and `x` remain unchanged.
