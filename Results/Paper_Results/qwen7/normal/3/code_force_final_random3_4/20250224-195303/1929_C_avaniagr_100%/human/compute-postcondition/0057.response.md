Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`.
   - `x` is an integer greater than or equal to `k - 3`.
   - `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`.
   - `z` is initially set to `k - 1` and then increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   The loop runs for `i` in the range `x - k + 3`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x - k + 3`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

4. **Adjust the other relevant variables:**
   - `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` at the end of the previous iteration. We need to reflect this change in the state.

5. **Calculate the new value of `z`:**
   - Initially, `z = k - 1`.
   - After the increase, `z` becomes `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`.

Given these steps, let's formulate the new state:

- `t` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `x` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`.

Since `i` needs to be 1 for the next iteration, we can summarize the new state as follows:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to `k - 3`, `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`, `z` is `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 1**.
