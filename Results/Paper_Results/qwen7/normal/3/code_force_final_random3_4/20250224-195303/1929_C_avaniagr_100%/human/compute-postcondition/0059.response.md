Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to `k - 3`, `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`, `z` is `k - 1` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `k` remains the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` remains an integer greater than or equal to `k - 3`, `a` remains the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`, and `z` is updated by starting from `k - 1` and then adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each of the `x - k + 3` iterations of the loop.
