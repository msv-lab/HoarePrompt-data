Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`.
   - `x` is an integer greater than or equal to `k - 3`.
   - `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`.
   - `z` is defined as `k - 1` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to `x - k + 3`.
   - The current value of `z` satisfies the condition `a >= z`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

Given the code snippet, it only contains a `print('YES')` statement. This means regardless of the values of the other variables, the output will always be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
