Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`.
   - `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`.
   - `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`.
   - `z` is equal to \(2 \times (k - 1) + (2 \times (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 1\).
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(x - k + 3):`.
   - This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = x - k + 2`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to determine the new state of `i` for the next iteration.
   - Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration (`i = i + 1`), the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < x - k + 3`.

4. **New State Calculation:**
   - Let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`.
   - After the increment, the new value of `i` will be `i_new = i_current + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i_new` must be less than `x - k + 3`.

5. **Final State:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`.
   - Therefore, the new state should reflect the updated value of `i`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`, `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`, `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`, `z` is equal to \(2 \times (k - 1) + (2 \times (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 1\), `i` is `i + 1`**.
