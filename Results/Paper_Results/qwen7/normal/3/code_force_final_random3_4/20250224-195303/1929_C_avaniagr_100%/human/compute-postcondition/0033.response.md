Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`, `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`, `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`, `z` is equal to \(8 \times (k - 1) + 1\).

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains within the range of 1 to 1000, `k` keeps the value of the first token from `s`, `x` retains the value of the second token from `s`, `a` stays as the value of the third token from `s`, and `z` is calculated as \(8 \times (k - 1) + 1\). The variable `i` will be equal to `x - k + 2` since the loop runs `x - k + 3` times and `i` starts from 0.
