Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`, `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`, `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`.**

In this output state, the variable `t` retains its original value as it was not involved in the assignment operation. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the integer values of the tokens split from the string `s`.
