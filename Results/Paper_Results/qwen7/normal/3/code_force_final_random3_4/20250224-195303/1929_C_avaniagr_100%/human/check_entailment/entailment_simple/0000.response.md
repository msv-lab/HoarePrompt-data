Reasoning:
Let's analyze the annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads input from standard input and splits each line into three integers \(k\), \(x\), and \(a\). This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: \(x < k - 1\)
     - If Sasha can lose no more than \(x\) times in a row, and \(x < k - 1\), then Sasha can always increase his bet after a loss because the maximum bet he can place is \(a\), which is sufficient to cover the required bet size. This condition correctly handles the scenario where Sasha can recover quickly from losses.
   - **Case 2**: \(x = k - 1\)
     - If Sasha can lose exactly \(k - 1\) times in a row, then Sasha needs at least \(x + 2\) coins to ensure he can recover. This is because after \(k - 1\) losses, he needs to place a bet of \(a\) coins, and he must have enough to cover this. This condition correctly handles the boundary case.
   - **Case 3**: \(x > k - 1\)
     - For this case, the program calculates the minimum number of coins \(z\) Sasha needs to recover from \(k - 1\) consecutive losses. The formula used is:
       \[
       z = (k-2) + \left(\frac{z}{k-1} + 1\right)
       \]
       This recursive formula ensures that Sasha can recover from \(k - 1\) losses and continue betting. The program checks if Sasha has at least \(z\) coins, which is correct.

3. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' if Sasha can achieve the goal and 'NO' otherwise. This matches the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins based on the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
