Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`.
- `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`.
- `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`.
- `z` is equal to \(2^n \times (k - 1) + n\), where `n` is the number of times the loop has executed.
- `i` is incremented in the loop but its exact value is not relevant to the `print` statement.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
