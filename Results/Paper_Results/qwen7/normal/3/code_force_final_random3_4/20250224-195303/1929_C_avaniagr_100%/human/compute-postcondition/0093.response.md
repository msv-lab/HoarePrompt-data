Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the next line `s`, `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`, and `z` is the result of either:
- Adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself, starting from the initial value of `k - 1`, for a total of `x - k + 3` times, if `x == k - 1`.
- Repeatedly adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself, starting from the initial value of `k - 2`, for a total of `x - k + 3` times, regardless of whether `a` is greater than or equal to `z` or not.
