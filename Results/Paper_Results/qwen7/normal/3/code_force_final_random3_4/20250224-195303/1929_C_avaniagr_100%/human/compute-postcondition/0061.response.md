Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to `k - 3`, `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`, `z` is `k - 1` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to `x - k + 3`, and the current value of `z` satisfies the condition `a >= z`.**
