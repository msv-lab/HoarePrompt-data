### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and conditions used in the program. However, let's re-evaluate the program and the annotated code step-by-step to ensure the logic is sound and the program meets the requirements of the problem.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input from standard input (file `0`).
   - It processes each test case one by one.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - For each test case, it reads a line and splits it into three integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).

3. **Conditions Based on \( x \):**
   - The program checks the value of \( x \) relative to \( k - 1 \):
     - If \( x < k - 1 \):
       - If \( a \geq x + 1 \), it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If \( x = k - 1 \):
       - If \( a \geq x + 2 \), it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If \( x > k - 1 \):
       - It calculates a variable \( z \) using a loop.
       - It checks if \( a \geq z \):
         - If true, it prints 'YES'.
         - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Calculation of \( z \):**
   - The calculation of \( z \) involves a loop where \( z \) is updated iteratively:
     ```python
     z = k - 2
     for i in range(x - k + 3):
         z += z // (k - 1) + 1
     ```
   - This loop seems to be an attempt to calculate a value that represents the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can eventually win any number of coins.

### Detailed Verification

#### Example 1: \( k = 2 \), \( x = 1 \), \( a = 7 \)
- \( x < k - 1 \) (since \( 1 < 1 \))
- \( a \geq x + 1 \) (since \( 7 \geq 2 \))
- Output: 'YES' (Correct)

#### Example 2: \( k = 2 \), \( x = 1 \), \( a = 1 \)
- \( x < k - 1 \) (since \( 1 < 1 \))
- \( a < x + 1 \) (since \( 1 < 2 \))
- Output: 'NO' (Correct)

#### Example 3: \( k = 2 \), \( x = 3 \), \( a = 15 \)
- \( x > k - 1 \) (since \( 3 > 1 \))
- Calculating \( z \):
  - \( z = 2 - 2 = 0 \)
  - Loop: \( z = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \)
  - \( z = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \)
  - \( z = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \)
  - \( z = 5 + 1 + 1 = 7 \)
  - \( z = 7 + 1 + 1 = 9 \)
  - \( z = 9 + 1 + 1 = 11 \)
  - \( z = 11 + 1 + 1 = 13 \)
  - \( z = 13 + 1 + 1 = 15 \)
- \( a \geq z \) (since \( 15 \geq 15 \))
- Output: 'YES' (Correct)

#### Example 4: \( k = 3 \), \( x = 3 \), \( a = 6 \)
- \( x = k - 1 \) (since \( 3 = 2 \))
- \( a < x + 2 \) (since \( 6 < 5 \))
- Output: 'NO' (Correct)

#### Example 5: \( k = 4 \), \( x = 4 \), \( a = 5 \)
- \( x = k - 1 \) (since \( 4 = 3 \))
- \( a < x + 2 \) (since \( 5 < 6 \))
- Output: 'NO' (Correct)

#### Example 6: \( k = 5 \), \( x = 4 \), \( a = 7 \)
- \( x = k - 1 \) (since \( 4 = 4 \))
- \( a \geq x + 2 \) (since \( 7 \geq 6 \))
- Output: 'YES' (Correct)

#### Example 7: \( k = 4 \), \( x = 88 \), \( a = 1000000000 \)
- \( x > k - 1 \) (since \( 88 > 3 \))
- Calculating \( z \):
  - \( z = 4 - 2 = 2 \)
  - Loop: \( z = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 \)
  - \( z = 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 \)
  - \( z = 11 + 11 + 1 = 23 \)
  - ...
  - Eventually, \( z \) becomes very large, much larger than \( a \).
- \( a < z \) (since \( 1000000000 \) is much smaller than the calculated \( z \))
- Output: 'NO' (Correct)
