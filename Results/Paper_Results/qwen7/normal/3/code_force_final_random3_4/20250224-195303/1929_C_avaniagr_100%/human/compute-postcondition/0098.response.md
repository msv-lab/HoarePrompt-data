Functionality: **The function processes lines of input, each containing three integers \(k\), \(x\), and \(a\). For each line, it checks specific conditions involving \(k\), \(x\), and \(a\) and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on those conditions. After processing all lines, it does not return any value.**
