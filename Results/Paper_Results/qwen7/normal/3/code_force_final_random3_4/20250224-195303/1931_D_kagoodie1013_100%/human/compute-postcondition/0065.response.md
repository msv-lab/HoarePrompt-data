Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `r_x` is `-(num % x)`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `residue_map[current_key]` is the value of `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r_x` to be `-(num % x)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
