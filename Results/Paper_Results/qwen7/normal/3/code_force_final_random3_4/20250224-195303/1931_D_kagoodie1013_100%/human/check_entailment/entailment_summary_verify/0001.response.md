### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input and parses them into the required format. This matches the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It uses a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the residues of each element modulo `x` and `y`.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required residues `r_x` and `r_y` and checks if there are any previous elements with matching residues, incrementing the count accordingly.
   - The logic for calculating residues and checking conditions is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Residue Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `r_x = -num % x` is correct. This ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
   - The calculation of `r_y = num % y` is also correct. This ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The function correctly counts the number of pairs `(i, j)` where both conditions are satisfied using the `residue_map`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the results for each test case as specified, which is correct.

Given the above points, the program appears to implement the solution correctly based on the problem description. The original assessment was accurate.
