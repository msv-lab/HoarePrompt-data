Output State: **`count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` must be initialized, `arr` must contain at least one element, `r_x` is `-num % x`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `-num % x` to the variable `r_x`. The other variables (`count`, `residue_map`, `num`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `r_x` depends on the values of `num` and `x`, but since those values are not specified, we express `r_x` in terms of them.
