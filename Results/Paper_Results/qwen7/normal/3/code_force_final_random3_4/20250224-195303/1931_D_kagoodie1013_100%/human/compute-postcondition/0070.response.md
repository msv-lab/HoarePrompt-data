Output State: `count` is the sum of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y` for each `num` in `arr`, `arr` is an empty list, `r_x` is `-(num % x)` for each `num` in `arr`, `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`, `residue_map` contains the count of each unique `(num % x, num % y)` pair in `arr`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `count` will hold the total number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` found in `residue_map` for each element in `arr`. The `current_key` will reflect the last computed key in the loop, `arr` will be exhausted (empty), `r_x` and `r_y` will be the results of the last iteration's calculations, and `residue_map` will contain the frequency of each unique `(num % x, num % y)` pair encountered in `arr`.
