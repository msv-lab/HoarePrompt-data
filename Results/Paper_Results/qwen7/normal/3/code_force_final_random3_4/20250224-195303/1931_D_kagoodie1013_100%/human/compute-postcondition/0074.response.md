Output State: **`results` is a list containing the final value of `count` after processing all arrays in `test_cases`. `residue_map` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair across all arrays. `count` is the sum of all values obtained from `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in all arrays. `current_key` is the last computed key `num % x, num % y` from the final iteration of the loop over all arrays. `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in all arrays.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `results` will contain a single value, which is the total count calculated by summing up the occurrences of each unique combination of `(-num % x, num % y)` across all arrays specified in `test_cases`. The `residue_map` will store the frequency of each such combination, and `current_key` will reflect the last computed key from the final array processed.
