Output State: **`count` is updated based on the new `num`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `(-num % x, num % y)` mapped to `1`, `current_key` is `(-num % x, num % y)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`**.

In this case, the code simply calculates `num % y` and assigns it to `r_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
