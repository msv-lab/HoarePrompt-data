Output State: **`count` is 0 + residue_map.get(current_key, 0), `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `current_key` is (num % x, num % y), `num` must be defined, `arr` must be a non-empty list, `r_y` is `num % y`, `r_x` is `-num % x`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `num % x, num % y` to `current_key`. The value of `count` remains unchanged as it is set to `0 + residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0)`, which is now `0 + residue_map.get(current_key, 0)` since `current_key` is the same as `(-num % x, num % y)`. The `residue_map` remains an empty dictionary, and the other variables (`num`, `arr`, `r_y`, `r_x`) remain unchanged.
