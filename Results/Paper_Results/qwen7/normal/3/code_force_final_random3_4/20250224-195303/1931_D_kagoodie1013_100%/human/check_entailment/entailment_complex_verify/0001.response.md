### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input and parses them into the required format. This part is accurate and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - It initializes a `count` variable to zero and a `residue_map` dictionary to keep track of the residues of each element modulo `x` and `y`.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required residues `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - It then checks if there are any previous elements with matching residues using the `residue_map`. If so, it increments the count.
   - Finally, it updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.
   - The logic for calculating residues and checking conditions is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Residue Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `r_x = -num % x` ensures that `r_x` is the smallest non-negative remainder when `-num` is divided by `x`. This is correct because `-num % x` is equivalent to `x - (num % x)` if `num % x != 0`, and `0` if `num % x == 0`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the results for each test case as specified, which is correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases well, such as when `x` or `y` is `1`, and when the array elements are very large. The modulo operations are correctly implemented to handle these cases.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the solution based on the problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and implements the solution accurately.
