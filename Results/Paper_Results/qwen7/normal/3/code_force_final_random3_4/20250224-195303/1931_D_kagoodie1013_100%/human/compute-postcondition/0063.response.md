Output State: **`current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `arr` must contain at least one element, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `residue_map[current_key]` is the value of `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count of the `current_key` (which is `num % x, num % y`) by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
