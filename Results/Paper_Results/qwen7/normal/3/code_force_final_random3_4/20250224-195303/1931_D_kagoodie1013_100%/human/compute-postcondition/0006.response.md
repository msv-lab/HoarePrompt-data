Output State: **`count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` must be initialized, `arr` must contain at least one element, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`**.

The code `r_y = num % y` assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to the variable `r_y`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `y`, `r_y` is calculated as `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
