Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `r_x` is `-num % x`.**

Explanation: The code `r_x = -num % x` assigns the value of `-num % x` to the variable `r_x`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `num` and `x`, `r_x` will hold the result of the modulo operation followed by negation. The precondition that `arr` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
