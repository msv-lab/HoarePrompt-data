Output State: **`num` is the next element in `arr`; `count` is updated by adding the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` to its current value; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`; `residue_map` is updated with the new key-value pair involving `current_key` and the incremented value.**

Explanation: The code updates `current_key` to be `(num % x, num % y)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
