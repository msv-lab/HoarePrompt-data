Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to n, `answer` is a list containing the numbers 1 and the element at index -1 of list `a`, `a` is a list containing [1, -2]**.

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of list `a` by 1. Initially, `a` was `[1, -1]`. After executing the code, the last element `-1` is now `-2`, resulting in `a` being `[1, -2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
