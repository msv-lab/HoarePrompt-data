Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[-1]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`. However, the initial values or states of `answer`, `array`, and `a` are not provided. Since no changes are made to `i` or `n`, their states remain the same. The only change is that `answer` now contains one additional element, which is the value of `array[a[-1]]`.
