Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `array` is unchanged, `a`[-1] is decreased by 1, `answer` has a new element which is `array[a[-1]]`**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element at the index `a[-1]` from the array `array` to the list `answer`. According to the initial state, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1 before this line of code is executed. Therefore, `a[-1]` is now one less than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.
