Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is `[1, -1]`, `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to int, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integer 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if (-1) ** i == -1:
        answer.append(array[a[-1]])
        a[-1] -= 1
    else:
        answer.append(array[a[0]])
        a[0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `(-1)^i` equals -1, then `answer` contains the element at index `array[a[-1] - 1]`. Otherwise, `a[0]` is increased by 1, and `answer` now contains the element `array[a[0]]` from the original list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `array` is unchanged, `a` is such that either `a[-1]` is decreased by 1 and `answer` has a new element which is `array[a[-1]]`, or `a[0]` is incremented to 1 and `answer` has an element appended which is `array[a[0]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `array` remains unchanged, `answer` has either a new element which is `array[a[-1]-1]` (when `a[-1]` is decreased by 1) or an element appended which is `array[1]` (when `a[0]` is incremented to 1).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
