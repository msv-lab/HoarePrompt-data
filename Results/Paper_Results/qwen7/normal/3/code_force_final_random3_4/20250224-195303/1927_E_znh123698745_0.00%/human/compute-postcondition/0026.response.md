Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `array` is unchanged. If `(-1) ** i` equals -1, then `a[-1]` is decreased by 1 and `answer` has a new element which is `array[a[-1]]`. Otherwise, `a[0]` is 2 (previously incremented to 1) and `answer` has an element appended which is `array[1]`.
