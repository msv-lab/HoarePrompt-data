Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the value of `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`. However, the initial values of `i`, `n`, and the state of `a` and `array` are not provided, so their states remain unchanged. The only new information is that `answer` now contains an additional element which is `array[a[0]]`.
