Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    array = list(range(1, n + 1))
    answer = [1]
    a = [1, -1]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if (-1) ** i == -1:
            answer.append(array[a[-1]])
            a[-1] -= 1
        else:
            answer.append(array[a[0]])
            a[0] += 1
    print(*answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n-1`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, and `n` will be greater than or equal to `n`. The variable `array` will remain unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `a` will be updated based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, if `(-1)**i` is `-1`, the last element of `a` (`a[-1]`) will be decremented by 1 each time this condition is met, and the corresponding element from `array` will be appended to `answer`. Otherwise, the first element of `a` (`a[0]`) will be incremented by 1 each time this condition is met, and the corresponding element from `array` will be appended to `answer`.

The final state of `answer` will be a list where each element is derived from `array` based on the conditions described above, with the length of `answer` being `n-1`. The exact elements in `answer` depend on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]` and the parity of `i` during each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` is now equal to `n`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as an input integer. The variable `k` remains unchanged. The `array` remains a list containing numbers from 1 to n. The `answer` list contains elements appended based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, for each iteration, if `(-1)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The `answer` list will contain `n` elements. Specifically, it will start with 1 (since initially `answer` contains the element 1), and each subsequent element will be determined based on the conditions inside the loop. Given the loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, for each odd `i`, the last element of `a` (either `a[-1]` or `a[0]`) will be used to append an element from `array`. For even `i`, the first element of `a` (either `a[-1]` or `a[0]`) will be adjusted and used to append an element from `array`.

Since `a` starts as `[1, -1]` and `array` is a list of numbers from 1 to `n`, the final `answer` list will contain the sequence of elements from `array` based on the described logic. After `n-1` iterations, `a[-1]` will be reduced to `2-n` and `a[0]` will be increased to `n-1`. Thus, the final `answer` will contain elements from `array` in a specific pattern determined by the loop's conditions.

For example, if `n=4`, the `answer` list might look like `[1, 4, 3, 2]` depending on how the conditions are met during each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
