Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to n, `answer` is a list containing the numbers 1 and the element at index -1 of list `a`, `a` is a list containing [1, -1]**.

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element at the index specified by `a[-1]` (which is `-1`) of the list `array` to the list `answer`. Since `array` contains numbers from 1 to `n`, the element at index `-1` (which is the last element) is `n`. Therefore, `answer` now contains the numbers 1 and `n`.
