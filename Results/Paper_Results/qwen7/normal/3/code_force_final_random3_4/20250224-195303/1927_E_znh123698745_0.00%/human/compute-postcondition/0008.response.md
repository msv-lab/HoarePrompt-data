Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `answer` contains the element at index `array[a[-1] - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of list `a` by 1. Since `a[-1]` was previously the last element of `a`, after decrementing, `a[-1]` now refers to the new value which is the previous value minus 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `answer`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains valid. The value of `answer` is now determined based on the updated value of `a[-1]`.
