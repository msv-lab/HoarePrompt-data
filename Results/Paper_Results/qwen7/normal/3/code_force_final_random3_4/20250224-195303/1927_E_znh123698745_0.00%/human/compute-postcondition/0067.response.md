Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. After the loop completes, the state is given as `i` is now equal to `n` and `k` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - **`i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 and increments `i` until it reaches `n-1`. Since after the loop, `i` is equal to `n`, this means the loop ran `n-1` times, and `i` was incremented from 1 to `n-1` and then one more time to reach `n`.
   - **`n`**: The value of `n` must be such that the loop runs `n-1` times. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`).

4. **Other Variables**:
   - **`k`**: The problem states that `k` remains unchanged, so no adjustment is needed for `k`.
   - **`array`**: This list is not involved in the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for `array`.
   - **`answer`**: This list is not involved in the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for `answer`.
   - **`a`**: This list is not involved in the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for `a`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
