Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `(-1) ** i` equals `-1`, then `array` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1, and `answer` has a new element which is `array[a[-1]]`. Otherwise, `answer` has an element appended which is `array[a[0]]`, and `a[0]` is 1.
