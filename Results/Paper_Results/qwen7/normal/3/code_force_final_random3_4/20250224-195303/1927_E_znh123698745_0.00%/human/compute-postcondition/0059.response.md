Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `array` is unchanged. If `(-1)**i` equals -1 (which is true when `i` is odd, and `i` is 3 in this case), then `answer` is updated with the element at index `array[a[-1]-1]`. Otherwise, `a[0]` is incremented by 1, and the element `array[a[0]]` is appended to `answer`.
