Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `array` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1, `answer` has a new element which is `array[a[-1]]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. Since `a[-1]` was previously the last element of `a`, it is now one less than its original value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `array`, `a`, and `answer`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
