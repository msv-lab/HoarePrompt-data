Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`. If the condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` holds, `i` remains 0. Otherwise, the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` holds true, and if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` remains equal to `i`.
