Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`, we continue to the next iteration.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or reassigned within the `continue` statement itself, the values of `i`, `n`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` remain unchanged from their initial states. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
