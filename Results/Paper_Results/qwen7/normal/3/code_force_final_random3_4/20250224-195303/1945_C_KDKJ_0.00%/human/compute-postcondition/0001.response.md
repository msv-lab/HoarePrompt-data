Output State: **`func_1()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `func_1()` calls the function `func_1`. Since no variables are defined or modified within this line of code, the only information that changes from the initial state is that the function `func_1` has been called. All other variables remain in their initial state as described in the initial state.
