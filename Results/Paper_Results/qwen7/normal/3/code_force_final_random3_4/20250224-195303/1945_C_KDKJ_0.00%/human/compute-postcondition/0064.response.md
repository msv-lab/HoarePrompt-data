Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rsum` to be `n - lsum`. Given that `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, the new value of `rsum` becomes `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
