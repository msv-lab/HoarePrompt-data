### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find an optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the village are satisfied.
   - The satisfaction condition is checked using the formula: 
     - For the left side: \( \text{left} \geq \left\lceil \frac{\text{left}}{2} \right\rceil \)
     - For the right side: \( \text{right} \geq \left\lceil \frac{\text{right}}{2} \right\rceil \)
   - If the position `i` satisfies these conditions, we check if it minimizes \( \left| \frac{n}{2} - i \right| \).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - **func_1():**
     - The function reads the number of houses `n` and the sequence `a`.
     - It calculates the cumulative counts of '0' (left side) and '1' (right side) up to each house.
     - It iterates through each possible position `i` to check the satisfaction condition for both sides.
     - It updates the answer `ans` if the current position `i` meets the conditions and minimizes \( \left| \frac{n}{2} - i \right| \).
   - **func_2():**
     - This function handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` correctly calculates the cumulative counts and checks the satisfaction conditions.
   - The logic for updating the answer `ans` ensures that the position is chosen to be as close to the middle of the village as possible while satisfying the conditions.
   - The implementation handles all edge cases and test cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
