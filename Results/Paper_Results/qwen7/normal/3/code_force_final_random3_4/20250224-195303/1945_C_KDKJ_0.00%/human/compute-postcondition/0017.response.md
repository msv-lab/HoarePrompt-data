Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1'; `S` is a list containing a sublist [x, y] where x and y are determined based on the last character of `a`; if the last character of `a` is '0', `x` is the last element of the last sublist in `S` + 1; otherwise, `y` is increased by 1.
