Output State: The final state of `S` will be a list containing sublists `[x, y]` for each character in the string `a`, where `x` is the count of '0's encountered so far and `y` is the count of '1's encountered so far. The length of `S` will be equal to the length of the input string `a` plus one, as a new sublist is appended to `S` for each iteration of the loop.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `S` will contain a sublist for each character in the input string `a`. Each sublist will have two elements: the first element will be the total count of '0's encountered up to that point, and the second element will be the total count of '1's encountered up to that point. The length of `S` will be one more than the length of the input string `a`, as a new sublist is added for each character processed.
