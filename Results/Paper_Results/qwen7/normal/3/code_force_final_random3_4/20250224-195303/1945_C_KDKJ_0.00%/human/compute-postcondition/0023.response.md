Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1'; `x` is the last element of the sublist in `S[-1]` plus 1; `y` is the second last element of the sublist in `S[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Since `x` was originally the last element of the sublist in `S[-1]`, after executing the code, `x` becomes the last element of the sublist in `S[-1]` plus 1. The value of `y` remains unchanged, and the string `a` also remains unchanged.
