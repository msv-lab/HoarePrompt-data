Output State: The function `func_1()` has been called three times, and the loop will continue to call `func_1()` as long as the user inputs a positive integer value.

Explanation: Based on the given information, each iteration of the loop calls `func_1()`. After the loop has executed 3 times, it means that the user has inputted a positive integer three consecutive times. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `func_1()` will have been called as many times as the user provided positive integers. The loop will terminate when the user inputs a non-positive integer (0 or negative).
