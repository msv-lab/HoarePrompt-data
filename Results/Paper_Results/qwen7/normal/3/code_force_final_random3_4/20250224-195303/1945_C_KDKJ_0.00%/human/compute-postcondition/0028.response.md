Output State: The final state of `S` will be a list containing sublists where each sublist [x, y] represents the count of '0's and '1's encountered in the input string `a` up to that point in the loop. Specifically, `S[-1]` will contain the total counts of '0's and '1's in the entire string `a`. All other sublists in `S` will represent intermediate counts accumulated during each iteration of the loop.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `S` will contain the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's found in the input string `a`. The last sublist in `S` will have the total count of '0's and '1's in `a`, while the earlier sublists will show the counts accumulated up to each respective point in the string.
