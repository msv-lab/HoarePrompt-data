You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        x, y = S[-1]
        
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        
        S.append([x, y])
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `S` will be a list containing sublists `[x, y]` for each character in the string `a`, where `x` is the count of '0's encountered so far and `y` is the count of '1's encountered so far. The length of `S` will be equal to the length of the input string `a` plus one, as a new sublist is appended to `S` for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `S` will contain a sublist for each character in the input string `a`. Each sublist will have two elements: the first element will be the total count of '0's encountered up to that point, and the second element will be the total count of '1's encountered up to that point. The length of `S` will be one more than the length of the input string `a`, as a new sublist is added for each character processed.
    ans = 0
    satisfy = 0
    for i in range(n):
        left = S[i][0]
        
        lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
        
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        
        rsum = n - lsum
        
        if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
            continue
        elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):
            ans = i
        
    #State: The value of `ans` is the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n / 2`, while satisfying the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` for all executed iterations of the loop.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the index i that minimizes |i - n / 2| and satisfies left * 2 >= lsum and right * 2 >= rsum for all executed iterations of the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', where n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
