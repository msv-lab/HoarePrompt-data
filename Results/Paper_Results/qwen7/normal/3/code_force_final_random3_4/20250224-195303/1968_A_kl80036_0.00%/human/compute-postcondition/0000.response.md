Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the value of `int(input())` is a non-negative integer. However, since the problem specifies that `t` (which is the input value) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), we can be confident that `int(input())` will always return a valid non-negative integer within this range.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the initial state of `i` is set correctly. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the first value of `i` will be 0. The number of iterations will be equal to the value of `t`.

Given the constraints and the loop head, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i` and the value of `t` that will be read from the input.

**State:**
- `i` should be 0 (the starting value).
- `t` (which will be read from the input) should be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**
