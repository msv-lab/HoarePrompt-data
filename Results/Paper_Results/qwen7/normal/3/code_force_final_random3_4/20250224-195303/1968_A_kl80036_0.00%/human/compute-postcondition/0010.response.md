Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`**

The code `y = x // 2` does not change the values of `i` and `t`. It updates the value of `y` to be the integer division of `x` by 2. Since `x` is an input integer, `y` will be the integer division of that input by 2. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) remains unchanged.
