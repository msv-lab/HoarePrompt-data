Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`, `x` is the new input integer from the user.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` replaces the current value of `x` with a new integer input from the user. The values of `i`, `t`, and `y` remain unchanged.
