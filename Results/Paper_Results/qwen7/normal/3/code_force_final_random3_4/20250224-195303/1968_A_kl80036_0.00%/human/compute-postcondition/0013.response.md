Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` will be the last input integer from the user, and `y` will be `x // 2`.

This means that the loop will run exactly `t` times, incrementing `i` from 0 to `t-1`. The variable `x` will hold the value of the last input integer provided by the user during the final iteration, and `y` will be the result of dividing `x` by 2 using integer division.
