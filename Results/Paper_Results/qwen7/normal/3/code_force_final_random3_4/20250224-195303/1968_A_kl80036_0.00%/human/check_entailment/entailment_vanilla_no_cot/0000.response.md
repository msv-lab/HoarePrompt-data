Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic `y = x // 2` does not guarantee that the output will maximize `\gcd(x, y) + y`. 

To find the correct `y`, we need to consider the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD). Specifically, we should look for `y` such that `\gcd(x, y)` is maximized while ensuring \(1 \leq y < x\).

A better approach would be to iterate through possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to `1` and check the GCD value. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max_gcd_value = -1
        best_y = -1
        for y in range(1, x):
            current_gcd = gcd(x, y)
            if current_gcd + y > max_gcd_value:
                max_gcd_value = current_gcd + y
                best_y = y
        print(best_y)

func()
```

This program iterates through all possible values of `y` from `1` to `x-1`, calculates the GCD for each, and keeps track of the `y` that gives the maximum value of `\gcd(x, y) + y`.
