Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the range and the variable being iterated over. In this case, the loop is iterating over `y` using the range function `range(x - 1, 0, -1)`. This means `y` will take values from `x-1` down to `1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `y`**: Since the loop starts with `y` taking the value `x-1`, we need to set `y` to `x-1`.

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `y` is greater than 0. Given that `y` starts at `x-1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, the loop will always execute as long as `x > 1`.

4. **Adjust the other variables**: The other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `y` should be set to `x-1` (the starting value of `y`).
- The other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum`) do not need adjustment since they are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`y` is `x-1`**
