Output State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-1`, `y` is `x-1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, and the current value of `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`.**

Explanation: The code `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to be equal to the current value of `current_sum`. Since the initial state specifies that `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, this update ensures that `max_sum` now holds the same value as `current_sum`. All other variables (`gcd_val`, `y`, and `current_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
