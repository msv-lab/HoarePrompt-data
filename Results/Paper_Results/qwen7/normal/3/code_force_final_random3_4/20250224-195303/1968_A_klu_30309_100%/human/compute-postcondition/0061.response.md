Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for x in test_cases:`. The variables involved in this loop are `x` and `test_cases`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element in `test_cases`. At the end of each iteration, `x` takes on the next value from `test_cases`.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `max_sum` and `best_y` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.
   - `x` will take on the next value from `test_cases`.
   - `y` and `results` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Given the information:
- `max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the iterations.
- `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value that maximizes `gcd_val + y`.
- `x` and `y` have completed all their iterations as defined in the loop.
- `results` is a list containing `best_y`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `x` will take on the next value from `test_cases`.
- `y` and `results` remain unchanged.
- `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the iterations, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value that maximizes `gcd_val + y`, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`, `y` and `results` remain unchanged**. 

However, since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can only say it is the next value from `test_cases`.

Final Answer:
State: **`max_sum` is the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the iterations, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value that maximizes `gcd_val + y`, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`, `y` and `results` remain unchanged**.
