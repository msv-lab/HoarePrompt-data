Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 1`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 2)`, `current_sum` is `math.gcd(x, x - 2) + (x - 2)**

Explanation: The code updates `gcd_val` to be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. Given that `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is now `math.gcd(x, x - 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `max_sum` remains equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` remains `x - 1`, `x` remains a positive integer, `y` remains `x - 2`, and `current_sum` is updated to be the GCD of `x` and `x - 2` plus `x - 2`.
