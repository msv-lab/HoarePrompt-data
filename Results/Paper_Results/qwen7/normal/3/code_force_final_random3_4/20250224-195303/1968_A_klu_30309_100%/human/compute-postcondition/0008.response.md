Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is 1, `x` is at least 2, `y` is \(x - 1\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation: The line `max_sum = current_sum` simply assigns the current value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`. No other variables are affected, so the values of `results`, `t`, `test_cases`, `best_y`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged from their initial states.
