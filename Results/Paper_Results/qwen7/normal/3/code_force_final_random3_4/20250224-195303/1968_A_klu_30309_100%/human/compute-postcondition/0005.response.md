Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is at least 2, `y` is \(x - 1\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y`, where `y` is initialized to `x - 1`. However, since no specific values for `x` and `y` are provided, `gcd_val` remains as the gcd of `x` and `x - 1`, which is 1 (since any number and its predecessor are coprime). The other variables remain unchanged.
