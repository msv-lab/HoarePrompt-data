Output State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `current_sum` obtained from the loop for each `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value when `max_sum` was updated, `x` is the last value of `x` processed in the loop, `y` is the last value of `y` processed in the loop, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `max_sum` will hold the highest sum of the greatest common divisor and the second largest number for any `x` in `test_cases`. `best_y` will be the second largest number that achieved this maximum sum. The values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair processed by the loop, and `gcd_val` and `current_sum` will reflect the result of the final iteration.
