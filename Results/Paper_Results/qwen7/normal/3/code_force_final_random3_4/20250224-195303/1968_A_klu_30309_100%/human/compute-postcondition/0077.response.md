Output State: **`max_sum` is `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 2)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`**

Explanation: The code `best_y = y` assigns the current value of `y` (which is `x - 2`) to `best_y`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `best_y` is updated to `x - 2`, while `max_sum`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` retain their original values.
