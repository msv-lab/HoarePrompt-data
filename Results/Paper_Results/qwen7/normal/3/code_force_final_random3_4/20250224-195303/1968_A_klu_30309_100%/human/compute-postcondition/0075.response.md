Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 1`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 2)`, `current_sum` is `math.gcd(x, x - 2) + (x - 2), `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y**.

Explanation: The code updates `current_sum` to `gcd_val + y`. Given that `y` is `x - 2`, and `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 2)`, the new value of `current_sum` is calculated as `math.gcd(x, x - 2) + (x - 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
