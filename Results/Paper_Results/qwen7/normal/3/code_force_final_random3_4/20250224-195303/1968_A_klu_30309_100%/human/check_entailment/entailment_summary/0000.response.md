Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` to solve the problem.
2. The function iterates over each test case and for each `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
3. It then iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1, calculating the gcd of `x` and `y` and checking if the sum of the gcd and `y` is greater than the current `max_sum`.
4. If a larger sum is found, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current `y`, breaking out of the loop early since we only need one such `y`.
5. This process is repeated for each test case, and the results are stored in the `results` list.
6. Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
