Output State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-2`, `y` is `x-2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`**

Explanation: The code updates `current_sum` to be equal to `gcd_val + y`. Given that `y` is `x-2`, `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (x-2)`. Since `max_sum` was previously set to the same value (`gcd_val + (x-2)`), it remains unchanged. The value of `gcd_val` and `y` stay the same as well.
