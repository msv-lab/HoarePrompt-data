The code `break` is executed, which does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the execution simply stops here without affecting any variables.

Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y`, `x` is at least 2, `y` is \(x - 1\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.**
