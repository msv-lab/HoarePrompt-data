The code `break` does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program will exit the current loop or conditional context. However, since the context is not explicitly defined, we assume it is breaking out of a loop or conditional that was previously active.

Given the initial state:
- `results` is an empty list
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`
- `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`
- `best_y` is `x - 2`
- `x` is at least 2
- `y` is \(x - 2\)
- `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and \(y = x - 2\)
- `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`

After executing `break`, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program exits the current loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, `x` is at least 2, `y` is \(x - 2\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and \(y = x - 2\), `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
