Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `x`.
   - This part is correctly implemented using a list comprehension.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the test cases.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Loop Through Test Cases:**
   - For each test case `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using `math.gcd`.
   - It computes the sum `gcd_val + y`.
   - If this sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`. The loop breaks early because we only need the first such `y` that maximizes the sum.

4. **Result Collection:**
   - After processing all `y` for the current `x`, it appends `best_y` to the `results` list.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints each element in the `results` list.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Problem Requirement:** Find any `y` (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- **Implementation Check:**
  - The program correctly iterates over all possible `y` values from `x-1` down to 1.
  - It uses `math.gcd` to compute the GCD.
  - It checks if the current sum is greater than the previously recorded maximum sum and updates accordingly.
  - The loop breaks early once the maximum sum is found, ensuring efficiency.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the desired `y` for each test case. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
