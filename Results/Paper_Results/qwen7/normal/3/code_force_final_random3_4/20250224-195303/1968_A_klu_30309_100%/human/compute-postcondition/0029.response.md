Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over `x` using `for x in test_cases`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more element in `test_cases` after the current `x` is processed.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `results` is a list containing the single element `best_y`.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`.
   - `test_cases` must have at least one element.
   - `max_sum` is the maximum value of `current_sum` obtained from the loop for each `x` in `test_cases`.
   - `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value when `max_sum` was updated.
   - `x` is the last value of `x` processed in the loop.
   - `y` is the last value of `y` processed in the loop.
   - `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
   - `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `x` is the last value of `x` processed, the next value of `x` will be the next element in `test_cases`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must still have at least one element left.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next value of `x` being the next element in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` still having at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` is a list containing the single element `best_y`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases` and must have at least two elements (since the next element will be processed), `max_sum` is the maximum value of `current_sum` obtained from the loop for each `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value when `max_sum` was updated, `x` is the next value of `x` in `test_cases`, `y` is the last value of `y` processed in the loop, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**
