Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `max_sum` is 0; `best_y` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
    gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
    current_sum = gcd_val + y
    if current_sum > max_sum:
        max_sum = current_sum
        best_y = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `x` is at least 2, `y` is \(x - 1\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum <= max_sum`, the values of `max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `x` is at least 2, `y` is \(x - 2\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and \(y = x - 2\), `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`, and `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` if `current_sum > max_sum`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `x` is at least 2, `y` is \(x - 3\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and \(y = x - 2\), `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (x - 2)` or `gcd_val + (x - 3)` depending on the loop body, and either `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y` if `current_sum > max_sum`, or `best_y` is now `y` if the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
