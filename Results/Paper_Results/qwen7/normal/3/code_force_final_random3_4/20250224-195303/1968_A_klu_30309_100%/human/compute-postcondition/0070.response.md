Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 1`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 1)`, `current_sum` is `math.gcd(x, x - 1) + y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. All the initial conditions and values remain unchanged.
