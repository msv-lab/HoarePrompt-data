Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is at least 2, `y` is \(x - 1\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y\), `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `current_sum` the value of `gcd_val + y`. Since `y` is defined as `x - 1`, and `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
