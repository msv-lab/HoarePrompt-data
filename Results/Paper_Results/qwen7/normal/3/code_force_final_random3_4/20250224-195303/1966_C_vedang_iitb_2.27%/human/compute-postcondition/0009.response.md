Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, `winNext` is the return value of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_2` with two arguments: `a[1:]`, which is the list `a` starting from the second element, and `n - 1`, which is the length of the list `a` minus one. The function `func_2` returns a value, which is assigned to the variable `winNext`. The original list `a` and its length `n` remain unchanged.
