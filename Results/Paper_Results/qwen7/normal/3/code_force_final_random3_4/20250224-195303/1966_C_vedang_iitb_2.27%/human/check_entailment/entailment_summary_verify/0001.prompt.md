You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

    Alice

Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))
    a_temp = a_new.copy()
    for i in range(1, len(a_new)):
        a_new[i] = a_new[i] - a_temp[i - 1]
    return a_new

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        if a[0] % 2 == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return 2
    else:
        winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)
        if winNext == 2 or (winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1):
            return 1
        else:
            return 2



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and an integer `n` indicating the number of piles. It recursively determines whether the player who starts can guarantee a win based on the current configuration of stone piles. The function returns 1 if the starting player can win, and 2 otherwise.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves multiple piles of stones. Players take turns removing a positive integer \( k \) (where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile) from each nonempty pile simultaneously. The player who cannot make a move (i.e., all piles are empty) loses. We need to determine the winner assuming optimal play.

### Key Observations
1. **Game State Representation**: The state of the game can be represented by the sizes of the piles.
2. **Winning and Losing Positions**: 
   - A position is a losing position if any move from this position leads to a winning position.
   - A position is a winning position if there exists at least one move to a losing position.

### Provided Functions
1. **func_1(a)**:
   - This function aims to transform the list `a` into a new list `a_new` where each element represents the difference between consecutive elements in `a`.
   - However, this transformation does not seem directly related to solving the game logic.

2. **func_2(a, n)**:
   - This recursive function attempts to determine the winner for a given game state.
   - It checks base cases for \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \).
   - For \( n > 2 \), it recursively determines the winner by considering the next player's move and checking if the current player can force a win.

### Correctness Analysis
1. **Base Cases**:
   - For \( n = 1 \): If there is only one pile, the first player (Alice) can always win by taking all stones.
   - For \( n = 2 \): If the piles have different sizes, the player whose turn it is can always reduce the larger pile to match the smaller one, forcing the opponent into a losing position.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function correctly handles the recursive case by checking if the next player (`winNext`) would lose or win.
   - The logic to determine the winner is sound but needs to be applied correctly to the transformed game state.

### Detailed Analysis
- The function `func_1` is not used in the final solution, so it can be ignored.
- The function `func_2` correctly implements the game logic for determining the winner based on the number of piles and their sizes.

### Conclusion
The provided solution correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the number of piles and their sizes. The functions handle the base cases and recursive cases appropriately.
