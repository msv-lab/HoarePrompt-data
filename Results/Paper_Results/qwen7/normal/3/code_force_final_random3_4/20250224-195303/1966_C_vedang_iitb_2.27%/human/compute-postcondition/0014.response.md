Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a list `a` of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and an integer `n` indicating the number of piles. Depending on certain conditions, the function returns either 1 or 2.**

This means the function `func_2` takes a list `a` containing `n` integers (representing the number of stones in each of `n` piles) and an integer `n` (indicating the number of piles). Based on specific conditions, the function returns either 1 or 2, with multiple cases where it returns 1 and multiple cases where it returns 2.
