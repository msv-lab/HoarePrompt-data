Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function takes a list `a` and returns a new list `a_new` where each element starting from the second element is reduced by the corresponding element in `a_temp` up to one less than its original index.
   - However, this transformation does not seem to be directly related to the game logic. The game logic should focus on the smallest pile size and the strategy of removing `k` stones from all non-empty piles, where `k` is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function is supposed to determine the winner based on the optimal strategy. It checks the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - For `n == 1`, it returns 1 (Alice wins).
   - For `n == 2`, it checks if the first pile has an even number of stones, returning Alice (1) if true, and Bob (2) otherwise.
   - For `n > 2`, it recursively checks the subarray starting from the second pile (`a[1:]`) with `n-1` piles. If the opponent can force a win or if the first pile is not 1 and the opponent cannot force a win, it returns Alice (1); otherwise, it returns Bob (2).

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game logic should focus on the smallest pile size and the strategy of removing `k` stones from all non-empty piles, where `k` is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly simulate the game moves. Instead, it seems to be checking for specific conditions based on the number of piles and the parity of the first pile, which does not align with the actual game rules.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct approach would involve simulating the game moves and determining the winner based on the optimal strategy. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the game moves and thus does not accurately determine the winner.

Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the game logic. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
