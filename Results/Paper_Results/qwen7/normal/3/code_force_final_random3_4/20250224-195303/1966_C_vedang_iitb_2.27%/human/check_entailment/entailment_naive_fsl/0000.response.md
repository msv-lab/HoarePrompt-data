Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be related to the game logic at all. Specifically:

- `func_1` appears to be a utility function that modifies a list by subtracting cumulative sums, but this has no relevance to the game described.
- `func_2` seems to be a recursive function that returns a value (1 or 2), but it does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to implement a function that calculates the XOR of the sizes of the piles after applying the `func_1` transformation. If the result is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def xor_piles(a):
    a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))
    a_temp = a_new.copy()
    for i in range(1, len(a_new)):
        a_new[i] = a_new[i] - a_temp[i - 1]
    return a_new

def game_winner(n, a):
    transformed_piles = xor_piles(a)
    xor_result = 0
    for pile in transformed_piles:
        xor_result ^= pile
    if xor_result != 0:
        return "Alice"
    else:
        return "Bob"

# Reading input and processing test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(game_winner(n, a))
```

This corrected version correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the XOR of the transformed piles.
