Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the initial configuration of stone piles. Both players play optimally, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **func_1**: This function processes the input list `a` by removing duplicates, sorting it, and then transforming it such that each element (starting from the second one) is reduced by the previous element. This transformation is aimed at simplifying the game state.
   - **func_2**: This recursive function evaluates the game state and determines if the starting player (Alice) can win based on the simplified list returned by `func_1`.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly removes duplicates and sorts the list.
   - The transformation step ensures that the list is processed in a way that simplifies the game state, making it easier to analyze with `func_2`.

4. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - For \( n = 1 \), the function correctly returns 1 (Alice wins).
   - For \( n = 2 \), the function checks if the first pile is even; if it is, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - For \( n > 2 \), the function uses recursion to determine the winning strategy based on the remaining piles after the first pile is considered. The logic correctly handles the base cases and recursive calls to determine the winner.

5. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main loop reads the input, processes the piles using `func_1`, and then uses `func_2` to determine the winner.
   - The logic flow is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
