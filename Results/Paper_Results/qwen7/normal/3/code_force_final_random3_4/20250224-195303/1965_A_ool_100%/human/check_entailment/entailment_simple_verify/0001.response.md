### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(arr)` to determine the winner based on the game rules.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Step 1**: Convert the array `arr` to a set and sort it to get unique pile sizes in ascending order.
   - **Step 2**: Check if the smallest pile size is 1. If not, return "Alice" because Alice can immediately remove all stones in one turn.
   - **Step 3**: Iterate through the sorted unique pile sizes to check if the difference between consecutive pile sizes is exactly 1. If any difference is greater than 1, set `not_c` to `False`.
   - **Step 4**: Use a boolean variable `A` to toggle between `True` and `False` for each pile size. If `not_c` is `True`, toggle `A` one last time.
   - **Step 5**: Return "Alice" if `A` is `True`, otherwise return "Bob".

4. **Game Logic**:
   - The logic implemented in `func_1` is based on the Sprague-Grundy theorem, which states that for a Nim-like game with multiple piles, the Grundy number (or nimber) of a position is the minimum excludant (mex) of the Grundy numbers of the positions reachable from it.
   - For this specific game, the Grundy number of a pile of size `k` is `k % 2`. When all piles have the same Grundy number, the second player wins; otherwise, the first player wins.
   - The function correctly implements this logic by checking if the smallest pile size is 1 and then toggling a boolean flag based on the differences between pile sizes.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the smallest pile size is not 1 by immediately returning "Alice".
   - The function also correctly handles cases where the differences between pile sizes are not consistent, ensuring the correct winner is determined.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the logic, there is a flaw in the implementation of the game logic. Specifically, the function does not correctly implement the Sprague-Grundy theorem for the given game. The Sprague-Grundy theorem for this game would involve calculating the XOR of the Grundy numbers of the piles, not just checking the differences between pile sizes.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Step 3** in the function `func_1` should calculate the XOR of the Grundy numbers of the piles. The Grundy number of a pile of size `k` is `k % 2`. The XOR of these Grundy numbers determines the overall Grundy number of the game state.
- The function should return "Alice" if the XOR is non-zero, indicating the first player has a winning strategy, and "Bob" if the XOR is zero, indicating the second player has a winning strategy.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    grundy_numbers = [pile % 2 for pile in arr]
    xor_grundy = 0
    for gn in grundy_numbers:
        xor_grundy ^= gn
    return 'Alice' if xor_grundy else 'Bob'
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the function correctly implements the Sprague-Grundy theorem by simply checking the differences between pile sizes. The correct implementation involves calculating the XOR of the Grundy numbers of the piles.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
