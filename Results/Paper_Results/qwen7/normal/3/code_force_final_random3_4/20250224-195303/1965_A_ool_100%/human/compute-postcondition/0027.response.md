Output State: `A` is False, `not_c` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `set_`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `A` alternates starting from `False` (since it starts as `True` and changes each iteration). The variable `not_c` remains `False` because it is set to `False` when the condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` is met, which causes the loop to break. Since the loop breaks as soon as the condition is met, `not_c` does not change back to `True`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `set_` because the loop increments `i` from 1 up to `len(set_) - 1`, and then the loop ends.
