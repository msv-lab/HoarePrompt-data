Output State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is False, `set_` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. It only indicates that the program would exit the most internal loop or conditional block it was in. The initial conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
