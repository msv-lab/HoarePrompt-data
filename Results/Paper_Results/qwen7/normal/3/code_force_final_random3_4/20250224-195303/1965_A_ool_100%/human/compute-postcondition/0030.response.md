Postcondition: **`A` is False, `not_c` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `set_`.**

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `A` remains `False`, `not_c` remains `False`, and `i` is equal to the length of `set_`. The if part ensures that if `not_c` is `True`, `A` becomes `True`, but since `not_c` is `False` in the precondition, `A` remains `False`. The else part is not applicable here, so the values remain unchanged as per the precondition.
