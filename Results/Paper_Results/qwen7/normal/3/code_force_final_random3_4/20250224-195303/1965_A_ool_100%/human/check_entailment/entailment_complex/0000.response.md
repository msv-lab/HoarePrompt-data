Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of stone piles. The key insight is that the game state can be simplified by considering the unique values in the sorted list of stone counts.
2. The annotated program correctly identifies that if the smallest pile has more than one stone, Alice can always win by removing one stone from each pile, making the smallest pile have only one stone.
3. For the case where the smallest pile has exactly one stone, the program checks the gaps between consecutive unique values in the sorted list of stone counts. If any gap is greater than one, Alice can again force a win by reducing the piles appropriately.
4. If no such gaps exist, the game state alternates between Alice and Bob, and the final state determines the winner based on the parity of the number of moves made.

The provided code correctly implements these logic steps:
- It first ensures the smallest pile is not greater than 1.
- It then checks for gaps greater than 1 between consecutive unique values.
- Finally, it alternates the result based on the parity of the number of unique values minus one.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the function `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the optimal strategy.

Correctness: **True**
