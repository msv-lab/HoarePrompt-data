Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of piles `n` and the array `arr` incorrectly. It should read `n` separately and then read the array of sizes. Currently, `n` and the array are combined into a single list `n`, which is not correct.

2. **Function Call**: The function call `func_1(arr)` is incorrect because `arr` is already a list of integers, but the function expects a list of unique sorted integers. This means the function needs to be called with `set_` instead of `arr`.

3. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The logic to determine the winner is flawed. The current implementation checks if the smallest pile is not 1, which is incorrect. The correct approach involves analyzing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted unique set.
   - The logic for determining the winner is also incorrect. The current logic flips a boolean `A` based on the differences between consecutive elements, but this does not correctly implement the Nim game theory for this specific problem.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    
    # Find the minimum value in the array
    min_val = min(arr)
    
    # Count how many piles have the minimum value
    count_min = arr.count(min_val)
    
    # Determine the winner based on the count of minimum values
    if count_min % 2 == 0:
        print("Bob")
    else:
        print("Alice")
```

This corrected version correctly reads the input and uses the properties of the Nim game to determine the winner.
