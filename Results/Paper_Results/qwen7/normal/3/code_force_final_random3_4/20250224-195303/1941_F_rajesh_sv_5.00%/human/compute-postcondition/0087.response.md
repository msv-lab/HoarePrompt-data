To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `l` and `h`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `l < h`.
2. **Variables in Loop Head**: The variables `l` and `h` are the ones that control the loop's continuation.

### Conditions Inside the Loop:

- If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true:
  - `l` is set to `mid + 1`.
  - `h` is recalculated as `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.
  - `mid` is updated accordingly.
  - `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated to reflect the new values of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively.

- If the condition is false:
  - `l` remains the index obtained by bisecting the list `D` with the value `left - f`.
  - `h` remains `mid`.
  - `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
  - `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated to reflect the new values of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively.

### Determining the Next State:

For the loop to continue, the condition `l < h` must remain true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h` after the adjustments inside the loop.

Given that the loop can certainly execute one more time if `l < h` holds true, we do not need to make any specific adjustments to `l` and `h` based on the given conditions. The loop will continue as long as the condition is met.

### Conclusion:

Since the loop can certainly execute one more time if `l < h` is true, no specific adjustments are needed to the states of `l` and `h`.

**State:**
State: **`f` is the next value in the sequence defined by `F`, `l` is less than `h`, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated to reflect the new values of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively.**
