Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found in the entire array A, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or -inf if no such difference exists, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred or None if no valid index was found, `i` is n, `diff` is `A[n-2] - A[n-3]`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `A[index - 1]` to the variable `left` and `A[index]` to the variable `right`. The values of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `i`, and `diff` remain unchanged from their initial states.
