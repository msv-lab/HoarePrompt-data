Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` must be less than `h`**.

This means that the variable `mid` is now calculated as the midpoint between `l` and `h`. The values of `h` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states, with `h` being the result of `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` and `l` being the smallest index where all elements before it are less than `left - f` and it is the first index where the condition is no longer met.
