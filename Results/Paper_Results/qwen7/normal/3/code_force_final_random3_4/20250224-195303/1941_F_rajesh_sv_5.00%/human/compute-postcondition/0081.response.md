Output State: **`f` is the next value in the sequence defined by `F`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, the condition `(mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum)` is true.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to `mid + 1`. All other variables (`f`, `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition `(mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum)` remains true as no changes were made to `mid_sum`, `left`, `right`, or `mid_next_sum`.
