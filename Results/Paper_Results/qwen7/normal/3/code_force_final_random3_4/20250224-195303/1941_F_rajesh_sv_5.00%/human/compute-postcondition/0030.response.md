Output State: **`max_diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or `-inf` if no other differences were found, `index` is 7, `i` is 7, `diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`**

Explanation: The line `index = i` assigns the current value of `i`, which is 7, to the variable `index`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `max_diff` and `diff` are both `A[6] - A[5]`, `next_max_diff` remains the second largest difference or `-inf` if no other differences were found, and `index` is now 7.
