Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` are initialized to `-inf`, `-inf`, and `None`, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]
    if diff > max_diff:
        max_diff = diff
        index = i
    elif diff > next_max_diff:
        next_max_diff = diff


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or `-inf` if no other differences were found, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred or `None` if no valid index was found, `i` is `3`, and `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `next_max_diff` remains `-inf`, `index` is set to `2`, and `i` remains `2`. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains unchanged, `next_max_diff` is set to `diff`, `index` remains `None`, and `i` is incremented to `3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or `-inf` if no other differences were found, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred or `None` if no valid index was found, `i` is 5, and if `diff > max_diff`, `max_diff` is updated to `diff` and `index` is set to 5; otherwise, if `diff > next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or `-inf` if no other differences were found, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred or `None` if no valid index was found, `i` is 7, `diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to the previous `max_diff`, and `index` is updated to 7. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` is updated to the maximum of the previous `next_max_diff` and `diff`, and `index` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
