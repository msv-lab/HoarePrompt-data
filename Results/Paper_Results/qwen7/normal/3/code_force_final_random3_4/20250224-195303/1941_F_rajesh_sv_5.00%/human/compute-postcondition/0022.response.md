Output State: **`max_diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or `-inf` if no other differences were found, `index` is 5, `i` is 5, and `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`.**

Explanation: The line `index = i` assigns the value of `i`, which is 5, to the variable `index`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
