To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition and the variables involved in it.

The loop condition is `l < h`.

From the given information:
- `l` is either `mid + 1` or `h`.
- `h` is either unchanged or assigned to `mid`.
- `l < h` must be true.

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `l < h` must remain true. Let's analyze the possible states:

1. **If `l` is `mid + 1` and `h` is unchanged:**
   - The condition `l < h` must hold true.
   - Since `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` must be greater than `mid + 1` to keep `l < h` true.

2. **If `h` is assigned to `mid`:**
   - For `l < h` to be true, `l` must be less than `mid`.

Given these conditions, the only variables directly affecting the loop condition `l < h` are `l` and `h`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `l < h` remains true for the next iteration.

Since `l` can be either `mid + 1` or `h`, and `h` can be either unchanged or assigned to `mid`, we need to ensure that `l` is still less than `h`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `h` to maintain the condition `l < h`.

State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `total` is undefined, `students` is undefined, `l` must be less than `h`, and `h` must be greater than `l`**
