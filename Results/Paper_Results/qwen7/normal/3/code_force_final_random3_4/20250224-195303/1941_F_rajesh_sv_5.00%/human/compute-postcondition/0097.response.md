Output State: **`l` is the lower bound, `h` is `mid`, `mid` is the value of `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`**.

Explanation: The value of `h` is updated to be equal to `mid`. All other variables (`l`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
