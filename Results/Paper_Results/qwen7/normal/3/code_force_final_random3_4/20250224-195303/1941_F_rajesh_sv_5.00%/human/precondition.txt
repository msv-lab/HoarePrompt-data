t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5. The list a contains n integers in strictly increasing order where 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9. The list d contains m integers where 1 <= d_i <= 10^9. The list f contains k integers where 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
