Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Variables in the Loop Head
The loop head is `while l < h:`. The variables involved here are `l` and `h`.

### Step 2: Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute
The loop will execute as long as `l < h`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, the condition `l < h` must be true.

### Step 3: Analyze the Initial States of `l` and `h`
- `h` is defined as `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.
- `l` is defined as the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`.

### Step 4: Ensure the Loop Condition is Met
For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be strictly less than `h`. We need to ensure that this condition holds true based on the definitions of `l` and `h`.

### Step 5: Verify the Relationship Between `l` and `h`
- Since `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, it means `h` is the index just before the first element in `D` that is greater than or equal to `right - f`.
- `l` is the index such that all elements before `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`.

Given these definitions, it is possible that `l` could be equal to `h` if the conditions are not met properly. To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to make sure `l` is strictly less than `h`.

### Step 6: Adjust the States
To ensure `l < h`, we need to adjust the state such that `l` is less than `h`. This can be achieved by ensuring that the value of `l` is less than the value of `h`.

### Final Answer
State: **`h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` must be less than `h`**.

This ensures that the loop condition `l < h` is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute at least once.
