Postcondition: `f` is the next value in the sequence defined by `F`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`, `h` is recalculated as `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, and `mid` is updated accordingly. If the condition is false, then `l` remains the index obtained by bisecting the list `D` with the value `left - f`, `h` remains `mid`, and `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. In both cases, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated to reflect the new values of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively.
