Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is `mid`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `h` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, but since `h` is now `mid`, this expression simplifies to `mid + (mid - l) // 2`. However, the exact value of `mid` after this update is not specified in the initial state, so we keep it in terms of the expression. The other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`) retain their initial values.
