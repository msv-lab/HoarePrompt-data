Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred or `None` if no valid index was found, `i` is 7, `diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`**.

Explanation: The code sets `next_max_diff` to the value of `diff`, which is `A[6] - A[5]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
