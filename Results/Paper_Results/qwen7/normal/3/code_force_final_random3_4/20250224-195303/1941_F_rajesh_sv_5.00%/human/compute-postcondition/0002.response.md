Output State: **`func_6()` has been called.**

Explanation: The initial state only mentions the call to `func_6()`. Since no variables or their values are provided, and the function `func_6()` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine any changes to variables. Therefore, the only thing we can state is that `func_6()` has been called.
