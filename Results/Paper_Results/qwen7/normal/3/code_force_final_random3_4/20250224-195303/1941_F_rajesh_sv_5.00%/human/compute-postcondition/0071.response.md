Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`; the loop continues to execute until `l` is no longer less than `h`; `h` is the smallest index greater than `l` where `D[h] + f >= right`; `mid` is the midpoint between `l` and `h` calculated during each iteration; `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively; the current value of `l` is equal to `h`.**

This means that the value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The loop continues to execute until `l` is no longer less than `h`. At this point, `h` is the smallest index greater than `l` where `D[h] + f >= right`. The values of `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged from their previous values during the loop. The current value of `l` is equal to `h`.
