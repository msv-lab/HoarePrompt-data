Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `while l < h:`. The variables involved here are `l` and `h`.

2. **Understand the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than `h`. For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be less than `h` right before the loop starts.

3. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `f` is the next value in the sequence defined by `F`.
   - `l` is the index obtained by bisecting the list `D` with the value `left - f`.
   - `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `l` is less than `h` when the loop starts.
   - Since `l` and `h` are determined by the values of `left`, `right`, and `f`, we need to ensure that the relationship between these values ensures `l < h`.

Given the current states:
- `l` is the index obtained by bisecting `D` with `left - f`.
- `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.

For `l < h` to be true, `bisect_left(D, left - f)` must be less than `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`. This means that the value `left - f` must be less than the value `right - f` such that the index of `left - f` in `D` is less than the index of `right - f` minus one.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `left - f` is less than `right - f`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`f` is the next value in the sequence defined by `F`, `l` is the index obtained by bisecting the list `D` with the value `left - f`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` and `left - f` must be less than `right - f`**.
