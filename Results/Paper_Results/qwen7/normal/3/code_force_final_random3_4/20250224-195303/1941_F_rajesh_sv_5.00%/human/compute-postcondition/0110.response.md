Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `total` is undefined, `students` is undefined, `left` must be less than `right` plus `f`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `D[mid] + f` to `mid_sum` and `D[mid + 1] + f` to `mid_next_sum`. The values of `mid`, `D`, and `f` remain unchanged from the initial state. The variables `total`, `students`, `left`, and `right` are not affected by this code snippet.
