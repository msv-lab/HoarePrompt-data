Postcondition: **Output State: The final output state will have `l` equal to the smallest index such that the sum of `D[l] + f` is greater than or equal to `left`, and `h` equal to the largest index such that the sum of `D[h] + f` is less than `right`. The variable `mid` will be the midpoint between `l` and `h` during the last iteration, `mid_sum` will be `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` will be `D[mid + 1] + f`. Additionally, `l` is equal to `h` since the condition `l == h` is met.**
