Output State: `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is the final value obtained after the last iteration of the loop, which is either `mid` or `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the final value obtained after the last iteration of the loop, which is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `mid_sum` will be the sum of `D[mid]` and `f`, `mid_next_sum` will be the sum of `D[mid + 1]` and `f`, `h` will be the final high boundary determined by the loop, `l` will be the final low boundary determined by the loop, and these boundaries will maintain their properties as described in the loop's logic.
