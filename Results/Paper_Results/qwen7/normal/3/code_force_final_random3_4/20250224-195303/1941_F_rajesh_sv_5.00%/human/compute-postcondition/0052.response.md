Postcondition: `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is either `mid` or `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` depending on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.
