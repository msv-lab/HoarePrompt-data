State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer greater than 0.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
3. The variable `t` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.
4. Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it must be ensured that `t` is within this range for the loop to execute.
5. Therefore, the state of `t` must be adjusted to ensure it is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `i` must be set to 0.

Thus, the required state is: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0**.
