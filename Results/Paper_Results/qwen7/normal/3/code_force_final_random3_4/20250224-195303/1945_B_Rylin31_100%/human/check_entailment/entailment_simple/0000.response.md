Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided function to determine if it correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each case.
2. **Calculation**: For each test case, the function computes the number of fireworks visible at any given time using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`.
   - `m // a` gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period.
   - `m // b` gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period.
   - Adding `2` accounts for the fact that there can be fireworks from both installations visible at the same time, assuming they are launched at different times.

However, the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not accurately represent the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the periodicity at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.

To fix this, we need to calculate the LCM of `a` and `b` and use it to determine how many fireworks can be seen simultaneously.

Here's the corrected approach:
1. Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the LCM period.
3. Use the LCM to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

Given the current implementation, the provided solution is incorrect because it does not account for the simultaneous launches of fireworks from both installations properly.

Correctness: **False**
