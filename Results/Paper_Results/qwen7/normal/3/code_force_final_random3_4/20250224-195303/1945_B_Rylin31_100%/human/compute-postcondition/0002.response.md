Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input separated by spaces and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
