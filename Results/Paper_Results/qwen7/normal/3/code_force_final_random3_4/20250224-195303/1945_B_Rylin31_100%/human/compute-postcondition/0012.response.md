Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, a, and m for each test case, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}. It returns the result based on the value of t, processing a, b, and m accordingly for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by integers t, a, b, and m. For each test case, it processes t, a, and m to produce a result, but the exact nature of the processing and the return value is not specified in the given information.
