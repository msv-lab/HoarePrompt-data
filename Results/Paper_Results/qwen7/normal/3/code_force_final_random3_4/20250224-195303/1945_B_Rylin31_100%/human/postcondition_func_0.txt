The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) (where \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\)). For each test case, it calculates and prints the value of \(m // a + m // b + 2\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the calculated results for each test case.
