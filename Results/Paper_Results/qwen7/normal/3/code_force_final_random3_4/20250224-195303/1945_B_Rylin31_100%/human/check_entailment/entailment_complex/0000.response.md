Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously using the formula \( \text{m} // \text{a} + \text{m} // \text{b} + 2 \). However, this formula is incorrect for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\) to determine the interval at which both installations launch fireworks at the same time. The number of fireworks visible at any given time is the sum of the number of fireworks from each installation that fall within the visibility period plus one additional unit for the overlap.

The formula should be:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor + 1 \]

Where \(\text{lcm}(a, b)\) is the least common multiple of \(a\) and \(b\).

Given the provided code, the formula used does not account for the overlapping intervals correctly. Therefore, the given solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
