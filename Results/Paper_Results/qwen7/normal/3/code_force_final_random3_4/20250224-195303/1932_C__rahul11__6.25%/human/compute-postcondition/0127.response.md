Output State: **`ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `k` is 0, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `n` must be at least 2, and the current value of `s[k]` is 'L', `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
