Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `ans` is the product of `ans` and the third element of `arr`, `i` is the third element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies `ans` by `i`, where `i` is the third element of the list `arr`. The value of `ans` is updated to be its original value multiplied by the third element of `arr`. The list `arr` and the variable `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
