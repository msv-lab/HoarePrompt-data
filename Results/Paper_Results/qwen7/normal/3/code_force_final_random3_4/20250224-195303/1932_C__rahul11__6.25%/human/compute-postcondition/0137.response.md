Output State: **`k` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0, `res[2]` is 0, `l` is 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[c]` to `ans % m % MOD`. Given that `c` is 2, `res[2]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`. Since `ans` is 0, `0 % m % MOD` is still 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
