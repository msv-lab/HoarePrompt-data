Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in arr:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is `i * i`
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is the first integer input split from the input string
   - `m` is the second integer input split from the input string
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
   - `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string
   - `res` is a list of zeros with length `n`
   - `i` is the second element of `arr`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `arr`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second element of `arr` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be the third element of `arr`.
   - The list `arr` will be reduced by one element since the loop will process the next element.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:

- `ans` remains the same because it is calculated based on the current `i` and does not change until the next iteration.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `arr` will now be the list without its first two elements (since `i` was the second element).
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `res` remains unchanged.
- `i` will be the third element of `arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is `i * i`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `m` is the second integer input split from the input string, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer except the first two elements, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `res` is a list of zeros with length `n`, `i` is the third element of `arr`**
