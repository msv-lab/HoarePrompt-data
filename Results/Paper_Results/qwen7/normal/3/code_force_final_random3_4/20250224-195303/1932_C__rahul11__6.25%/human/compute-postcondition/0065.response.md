Output State: `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`.

Explanation: The loop multiplies `ans` by each element in `arr`. After all iterations, `ans` will hold the product of all the elements in the list `arr`. The variable `i` will be the last element of `arr` after the loop completes, and `ans` will be the cumulative product of all elements in `arr`.
