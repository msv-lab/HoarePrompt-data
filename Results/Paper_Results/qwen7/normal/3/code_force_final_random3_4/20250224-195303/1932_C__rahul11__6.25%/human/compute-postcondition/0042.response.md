Output State: **`c` is 5, `k` is 2, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` or `r` is adjusted based on the condition.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `c` is 3, `k` is increased by 1 making it `k + 1`, `s[k]` is checked against 'L', `ans` is updated accordingly, `c` is increased by 1 making it 4, and `k` is increased by 1 making it 2.
- The code `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` updates `ans` by performing integer division by `arr[l]` and then taking modulo `MOD`.
- The values of `c` and `k` are updated, and `ans` is modified according to the operation.
- `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`, meaning `res[5]` is now `ans % m % MOD`.
- The condition for adjusting `l` or `r` is not specified, so it remains based on the condition.
