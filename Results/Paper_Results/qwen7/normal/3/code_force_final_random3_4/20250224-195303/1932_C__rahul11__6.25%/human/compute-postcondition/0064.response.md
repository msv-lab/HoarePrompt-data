Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `ans` is the cube of the third element of `arr`**

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by `i`. Since `i` is the third element of `arr` and `ans` was initially set to the square of the third element of `arr`, after executing the code, `ans` becomes the cube of the third element of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
