Output State: **`ans` is the result of `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `s` is a string, `k` is an index within the string `s` and the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L', `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
