Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `m` is the second integer input split from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
