Output State: **`ans` is the result of `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `c` is `c + 1`, `k` is `k + 1` and k is less than `n - 1`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ans % m % MOD` to `res[c]`. Since `ans` is already defined as `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `c` is incremented by 1, and `k` is incremented by 1, the new value of `c` is `c + 1` and the new value of `k` is `k + 1`. The condition `k < n - 1` remains true as no changes were made to `k` or `n`. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are as mentioned above.
