Output State: **`ans` is the result of `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ans % m % MOD` to `res[c]`. The values of `ans`, `c`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `res[c]` is updated to the value of `ans % m % MOD`.
