Output State: **`c` is 2, `k` is incremented by 1, and `k` is still less than `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Given that initially `c` was incremented by 1 and then `k` was incremented by 1 (as per the postcondition), incrementing `c` again results in `c` being 2. The postcondition also mentions that `k` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `n - 1`, which remains unchanged by this line of code.
