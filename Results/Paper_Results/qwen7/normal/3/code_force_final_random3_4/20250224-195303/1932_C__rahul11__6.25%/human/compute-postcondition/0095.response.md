Output State: **`ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `c` is `c + 1`, `k` is `k + 1` and `k` is less than `n - 1`; `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ans % m % MOD` to `res[c]`. Since `ans` is initially defined as `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `c` is incremented by 1, and `k` is incremented by 1, the condition that `k` is less than `n - 1` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `c` is `c + 1`, `k` is `k + 1` and `k` is less than `n - 1`, and `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`.
