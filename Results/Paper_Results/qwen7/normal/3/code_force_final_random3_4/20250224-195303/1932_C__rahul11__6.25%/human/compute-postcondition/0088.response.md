Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated based on the character at index `k` in string `s`, `res[c]` is updated based on the new value of `ans` and `m`, `l` is updated if the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L', `r` is updated if the character at index `k` in string `s` is not 'L', `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`.**

This means that the value of `res[c]` has been updated to the result of `ans % m % MOD`. All other variables (`c`, `k`, `ans`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
