Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is 0, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `m` is the second integer input split from the input string, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer except the first three elements, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `res` is a list of zeros with length `n`, `i` is the fourth element of `arr`, `c` is 1, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `r` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` is increased by 1, `s` is a string, `k` is an index within the string `s`, `ans` is updated as follows: if the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L', then `ans` is the result of `ans // arr[l] % MOD`. After updating `ans`, `l` is increased by 1. If the character at index `k` in string `s` is not 'L', then `ans` is the value of `ans` divided by `arr[r]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. After updating `ans`, `r` is decreased by 1, and `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is 2, `k` is increased by 1, `s[k]` is checked against 'L', `ans` is updated accordingly, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` or `r` is adjusted based on the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is either 6 or 5, `k` is 2, `ans` remains unchanged, `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is increased by 1 if `s[k] == 'L'`, and `r` is decreased by 1 if `s[k] != 'L'`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
