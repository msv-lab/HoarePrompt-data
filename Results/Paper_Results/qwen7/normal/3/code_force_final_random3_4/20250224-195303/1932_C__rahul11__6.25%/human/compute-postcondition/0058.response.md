Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `c` is equal to `n-1`, `k` is equal to `n-2`, `s` is a list of characters from the input, `ans` is 1, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element is initialized to 0.**

The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
