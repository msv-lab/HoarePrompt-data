Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `m` is the second integer input split from the input string, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
