Output State: `results` is a list containing the total number of operations performed across all test cases, `t` is the total number of test cases, `test_cases` remains as the list of tuples containing the specifications for each test case, `i` is the last index of the `test_cases` list after all iterations, `n` is the length of the array `arr` for the current test case, `arr` is the sorted version of the input array for the current test case, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at `median_index` in the sorted `arr`, `heap` is the portion of `arr` starting from `median_index` with elements greater than or equal to `current_median`, transformed into a min-heap, `operations` is the total count of operations performed across all test cases, and `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap` during the operations.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain one element for each test case, indicating the number of operations required to make all elements in the array greater than or equal to the median. The total number of operations across all test cases will be summed up and stored in `results`.
