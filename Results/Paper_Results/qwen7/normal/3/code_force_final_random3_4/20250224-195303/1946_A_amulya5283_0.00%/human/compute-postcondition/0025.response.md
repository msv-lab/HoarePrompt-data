Output State: **`test_cases` is used to assign its i-th element to `n` and `arr`.**

In this case, the code assigns the i-th element of the `test_cases` list to the variables `n` and `arr`. Since the exact values of `test_cases` and `i` are not specified, we can only say that `n` and `arr` now hold the i-th element of `test_cases`. The initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` is also not altered by this line of code.
