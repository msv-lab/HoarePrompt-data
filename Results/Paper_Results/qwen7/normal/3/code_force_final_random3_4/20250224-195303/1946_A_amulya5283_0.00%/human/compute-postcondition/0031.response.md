Output State: **`test_cases` is used to assign its i-th element to `n` and `arr`; `arr` is sorted; `median_index` is n // 2; `current_median` is arr[median_index]; `heap` is arr[median_index:]; `heap` is converted into a min-heap; `operations` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `operations` to 0. This operation does not affect any of the existing variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`). Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged, and only `operations` is added with the value 0.
