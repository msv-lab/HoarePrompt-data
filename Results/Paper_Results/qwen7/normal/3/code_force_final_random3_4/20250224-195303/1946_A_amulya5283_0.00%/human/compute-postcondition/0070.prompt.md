Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (the length of the array a) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (each a_i is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). The length of each array a is between 1 and 10^5, and the sum of all lengths n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, arr = test_cases[i]
    arr.sort()
    median_index = n // 2
    current_median = arr[median_index]
    heap = arr[median_index:]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    operations = 0
    while heap[0] <= current_median:
        smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
        heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
        operations += 1
    results.append(operations)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing 7, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]` with `heap` transformed into a min-heap without the smallest element, `operations` is 7, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`, `smallest + 1` is pushed onto `heap`, and `heap[0]` is now the final smallest element in the heap after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `operations` is 7; `heap` has its smallest element, which is now 3 more than the original median, replaced with `smallest + 1`; `smallest` is the new value after removing the smallest element from the heap, which is now the fourth smallest element in the original array; `heap[0]` is now `smallest + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 3`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 3]` to the end of `arr` with each element incremented by 6; `operations` is 9; the value of `results` is `[6]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
