Output State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]` with `heap` transformed into a min-heap without the smallest element, `operations` is 7, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`, `smallest + 1` is pushed onto `heap`, and `heap[0]` is now the final smallest element in the heap after all iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `operations` variable will hold the total number of operations performed, which is 7 in this case. The `heap` will no longer contain the smallest element it originally did, as each iteration pops the smallest element and pushes `smallest + 1` back into the heap. The `heap[0]` will be the smallest element remaining in the heap after all elements have been processed according to the conditions of the loop.
