The loop condition is `while heap[0] <= current_median:`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` must be true at the start of the next iteration.

Let's analyze the given states:

- `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 1`.
- `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element incremented by 1.
- `operations` is 3.

The only variables in the loop head are `heap[0]` and `current_median`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `heap[0] <= current_median` holds true for the next iteration.

Given that `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 1`, and `heap` is a heap starting from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` with the smallest element incremented by 1, the smallest element in the heap is `arr[n // 2 + 1] + 1`.

For the loop to continue, the smallest element in the heap (`heap[0]`) must be less than or equal to `current_median` (`arr[n // 2] - 1`).

Therefore, we need to ensure that the smallest element in the heap is still less than or equal to `arr[n // 2] - 1`.

State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 1`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element incremented by 1 and the smallest element must be less than or equal to `arr[n // 2] - 1`; `operations` is 3**
