Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2]` to the end of `arr`; `operations` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while heap[0] <= current_median:
    smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
    heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
    operations += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 1`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element incremented by 1; `operations` is 3
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 1`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element incremented by 1 and the smallest element is now the previous smallest element plus 1; `operations` is 4; `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before it was popped and incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `operations` is 4; `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before it was popped and incremented by 1; `heap[0]` is now the smallest element from the heap before it was popped and incremented by 2; `heap` includes the new element `smallest + 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
