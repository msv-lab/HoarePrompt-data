Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the `median_index` which is the floor division of `n` by 2. Since `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the sorted second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is determined based on the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
