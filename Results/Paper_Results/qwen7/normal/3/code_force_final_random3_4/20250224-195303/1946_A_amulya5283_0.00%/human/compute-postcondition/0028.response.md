Output State: **`test_cases` is used to assign its i-th element to `n` and `arr`; `arr` is sorted; `median_index` is n // 2; `current_median` is arr[median_index].**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `arr[median_index]` to the variable `current_median`. The `median_index` is defined as `n // 2`, and `arr` is already sorted. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`, and `median_index` remain unchanged.
