Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]` with `heap` transformed into a min-heap without the smallest element, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`, `smallest + 1` is pushed onto `heap`.**

Explanation: The code pushes the value of `smallest + 1` (which was previously popped from `heap`) back onto `heap`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
