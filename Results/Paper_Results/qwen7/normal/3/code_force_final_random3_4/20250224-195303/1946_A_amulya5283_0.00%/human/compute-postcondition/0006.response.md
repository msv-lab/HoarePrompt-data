Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`**

Explanation: The code initializes a new variable `heap` which is assigned the slice of the list `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end of the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
