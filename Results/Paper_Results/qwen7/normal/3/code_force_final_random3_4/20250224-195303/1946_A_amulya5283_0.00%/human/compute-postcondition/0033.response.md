Output State: **`test_cases` is used to assign its i-th element to `n` and `arr`; `arr` is sorted; `median_index` is n // 2; `current_median` is arr[median_index]; `heap` is arr[median_index:]; `heap` is converted into a min-heap; `operations` is 1; `smallest` is the smallest element in `heap`; `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`**.

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. This operation increments the number of operations performed by 1. The heap property is maintained, so `heap[0]` (which is now the new smallest element) must still be less than or equal to `current_median`. All other variables remain unchanged.
