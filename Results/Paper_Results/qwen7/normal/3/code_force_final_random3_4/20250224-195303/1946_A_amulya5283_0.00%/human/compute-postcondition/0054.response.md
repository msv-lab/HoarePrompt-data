Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2]` to the end of `arr`; `operations` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `operations = 0` initializes the variable `operations` to 0. No other variables are affected, and the initial conditions of the array `arr`, the median index, the current median, and the heap remain unchanged.
