Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Median Calculation**: The code incorrectly calculates the median index as `n // 2` which is not always the correct index for the median. For an even-sized array, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but the code only considers one of them.

2. **Heap Usage Misunderstanding**: The use of a heap to increment the smallest element until it exceeds the current median is inefficient and does not correctly reflect the problem requirements. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations to make the median strictly greater than its current value, not to increment the smallest element in the heap.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Sort the Array**: Sort the array to easily find the median.
2. **Determine Median Index**: Calculate the correct median index based on whether the array size is odd or even.
3. **Count Operations**: Count the number of operations needed to make the median strictly greater than its current value.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, arr in test_cases:
        arr.sort()
        median_index = n // 2
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        # Count the number of operations needed
        operations = 0
        for i in range(median_index, n):
            if arr[i] <= current_median:
                operations += current_median - arr[i] + 1
                arr[i] = current_median + 1
            else:
                break
        
        results.append(operations)
    return results

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        arr = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + n]))
        test_cases.append((n, arr))
        index += 1 + n
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This approach ensures that the median is correctly identified and the minimum number of operations to increase it is calculated accurately.
