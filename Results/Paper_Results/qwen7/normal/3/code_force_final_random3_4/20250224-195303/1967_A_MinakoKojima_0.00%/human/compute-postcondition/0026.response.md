Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[3] - a[2]), `k` is initialized, `m` is initialized**

Explanation: The code multiplies `ans` by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `(a[1] - a[0]) * (a[3] - a[2])`. The values of `k` and `m` remain unchanged as they were initialized and not affected by the code.
