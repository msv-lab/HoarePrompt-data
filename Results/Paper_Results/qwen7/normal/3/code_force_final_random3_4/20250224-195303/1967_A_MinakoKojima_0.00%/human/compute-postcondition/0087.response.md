Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is 0, `ans` is `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[3] - a[2]) * (a[4] - a[3])`, `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `a[i] - a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 4, `a[i]` is `a[4]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[3]`. So, `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[4] - a[3])`. Since `ans` was initially `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[3] - a[2])`, the new value of `ans` becomes `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[3] - a[2]) * (a[4] - a[3])`. The values of `i`, `k`, and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
