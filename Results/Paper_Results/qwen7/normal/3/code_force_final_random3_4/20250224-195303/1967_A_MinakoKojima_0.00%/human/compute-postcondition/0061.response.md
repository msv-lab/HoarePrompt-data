Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `ans` is the factorial of `n` if `k >= n * m`, otherwise `ans` is the product of differences between consecutive elements from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `m` is the minimum value of the list `a`.**
