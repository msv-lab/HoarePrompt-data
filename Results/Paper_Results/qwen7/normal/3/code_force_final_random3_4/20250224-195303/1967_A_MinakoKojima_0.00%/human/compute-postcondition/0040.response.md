Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is the first integer input minus `m` times the minimum value of the list `a`, `k` is `n * m` less than its original value, `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `ans` is 0, `m` is the minimum value of the list `a`.**

This means that the value of `k` has been updated to be its original value minus `n` times the minimum value of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
