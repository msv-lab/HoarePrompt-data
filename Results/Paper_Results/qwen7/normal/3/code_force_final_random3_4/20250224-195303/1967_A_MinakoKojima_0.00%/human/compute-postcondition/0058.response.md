Output State: **`i` is 4; `ans` is multiplied by `a[4] - a[3]`; `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `a[i] - a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 4, the expression `a[i] - a[i - 1]` becomes `a[4] - a[3]`. Therefore, `ans` is now multiplied by `a[4] - a[3]`. The value of `i` remains 4, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
