To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initialization of `i`**: 
   - `i` is set to `n`.

2. **Determination of `x`**:
   - `x` is assigned 1 if `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is assigned 2.
   - Since `a` is not explicitly defined with values, we need to consider how `a` is accumulated. However, the exact values of `a` are not provided, so we'll focus on the logic for `x`.

3. **Calculation of `b[n]`**:
   - `b[n]` is the sum of `b[0]` and the sequence of `x` values added up from `i=1` to `i=n`.
   - Since `b[0]` is not specified, we assume it is 0 for simplicity unless otherwise stated.
   - The sequence of `x` values added up from `i=1` to `i=n` depends on the value of `x` which is determined by `a[n]`.

4. **Accumulation of `a`**:
   - Each element in `a` is the sum of itself and all previous elements in the list `a`.
   - This means `a` is being accumulated in a cumulative manner.

Given these points, let's assume a simple example to illustrate the process. Suppose `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `n = 3`:

- For `n = 3`, `i` is set to 3.
- `a[3]` is 4, which is greater than 1, so `x` is 1.
- `b[3]` would be `b[0] + x + x + x = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (assuming `b[0]` is 0).
- The accumulation of `a` would be `[1, 3, 6, 10]` (1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4).

Now, the print statement `print(*a)` will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **1 3 6 10**
