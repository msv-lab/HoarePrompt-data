### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Analysis:**
   - The function starts by reading `n` and `q` for each test case.
   - It initializes a list `a` with a leading zero and populates it with the input integers.
   - It creates a list `b` initialized with zeros and fills it with cumulative sums based on the values in `a`.
   - The list `a` is then replaced with the cumulative sums of the original list `a`.
   - The function then processes each query, comparing the cumulative sums of the subarray defined by `x` and `y`.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The cumulative sum calculation in `b` ensures that `b[i]` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` plus some additional values (`x`).
   - This additional value `x` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the function calculates the difference between the cumulative sums of the subarray defined by `x` and `y` in both `a` and `b`.
   - If the difference in `a` is less than the difference in `b` or if `x` equals `y`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic for determining if a subarray is "good" is correctly implemented.
   - The comparison `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` ensures that the sums of the subarrays in `a` and `b` are different, which is a necessary condition for the subarray to be "good".
   - The condition `x == y` ensures that the subarray is not empty and properly handles edge cases.

Given the provided example and the logical steps in the code, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
