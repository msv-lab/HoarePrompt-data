Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers inputted separated by spaces, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
