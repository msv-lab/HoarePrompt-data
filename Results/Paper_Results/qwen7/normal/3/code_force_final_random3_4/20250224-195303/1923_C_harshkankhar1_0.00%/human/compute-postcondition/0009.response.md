Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive), meaning `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `2`
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `x` is `2`
   - `b[i]` is `b[1] + 2`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `2`, the loop will increment `i` by `1` in the next iteration, making `i` equal to `3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least `3` for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `3`.
   - `n` must be at least `3` for the loop to continue.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` is `3`
   - `n` must be at least `3`
   - `x` remains `2` as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `b[i]` will be `b[3]` since `i` will be `3` in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `x` is 2, `b[i]` is `b[3]`**.
