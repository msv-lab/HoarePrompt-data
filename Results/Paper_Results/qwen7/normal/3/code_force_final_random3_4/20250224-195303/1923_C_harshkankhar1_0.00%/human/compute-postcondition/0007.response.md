Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1 else `x` is 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. Since `i` is initially 2, the condition checks `a[2]`. If `a[2]` is greater than 1, `x` is set to 1; otherwise, `x` is set to 2. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `b[1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
