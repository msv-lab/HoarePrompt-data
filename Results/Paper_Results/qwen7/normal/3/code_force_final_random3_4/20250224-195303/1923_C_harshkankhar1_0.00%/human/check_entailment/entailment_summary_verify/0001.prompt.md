You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `a` and handles a series of queries. It first calculates a cumulative sum list `b` based on the values in `a`. Then, for each query, it compares the sum of a specified sublist in `a` with a corresponding value derived from `b`, and prints 'YES' if the sum in `a` is greater than or equal to the value from `b`, or 'NO' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the length of the array `c` and the number of queries.
   - It then reads the array `c` and initializes some variables for further processing.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to process the subarrays and determine if they are good.
   - However, the function name `func_1` is misleading because it doesn't actually implement the logic to check if a subarray is good.
   - Instead, it prints the cumulative sum of the array `a` and then processes the queries without checking if the subarrays are good.

3. **Accumulation and Printing:**
   - The program computes the prefix sums of the array `a` and prints them.
   - It then processes each query, but instead of checking if the subarray is good, it always prints 'NO' unless the start and end indices are the same.

### Correctness Check

- **Problem Requirements:**
  - A subarray is considered good if there exists an array `b` such that:
    1. The sum of elements in `a` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
    2. No element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
    3. All elements in `b` are positive.

- **Program Logic:**
  - The program does not implement the logic to check if a subarray is good.
  - It simply prints 'NO' for all queries, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
