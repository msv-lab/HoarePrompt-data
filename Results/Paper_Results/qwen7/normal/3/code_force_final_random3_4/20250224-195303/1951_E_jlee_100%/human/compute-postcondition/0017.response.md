Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the input string, and the current value of `x` is not equal to the last element of `s`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state and the `continue` statement does not modify any variables, the values of all variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
