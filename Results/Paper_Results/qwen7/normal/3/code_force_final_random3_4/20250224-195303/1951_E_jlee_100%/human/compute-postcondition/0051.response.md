Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the value of `s[n - 1 - j]`; `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `n`, `j`, `s`, or `done`.
