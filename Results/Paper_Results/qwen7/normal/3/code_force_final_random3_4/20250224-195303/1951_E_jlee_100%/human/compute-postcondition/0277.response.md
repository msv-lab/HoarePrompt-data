Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string.
- `done` is `True`.
- `count` is `j`.
- `count2` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged.
- `j` is `n`.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, we continue the loop.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
