Postcondition: `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. `done` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1. The current value of `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. `count2` is less than the current value of `count`.
