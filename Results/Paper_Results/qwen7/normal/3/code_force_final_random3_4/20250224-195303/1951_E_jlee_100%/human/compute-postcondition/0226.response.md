Output State: **`s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is `j`, and the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is `j`, and the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` remains valid after the execution of the `continue` statement.
