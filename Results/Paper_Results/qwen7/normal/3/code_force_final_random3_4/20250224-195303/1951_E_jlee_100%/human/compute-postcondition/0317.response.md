The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of a loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is `j`, `count2` is either incremented by 1, reset to 0, or remains unchanged, `j` is `n`.**
