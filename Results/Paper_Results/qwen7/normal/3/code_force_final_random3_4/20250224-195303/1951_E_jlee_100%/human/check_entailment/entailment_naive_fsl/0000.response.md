Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly partition strings that contain multiple non-palindromic substrings. 

Consider the following test case:
```
input:
3
aabbaa
aabb
abab
```

Expected output:
```
YES
2
aab baa
YES
2
aabb
YES
2
ab ab
```

However, the program will only output:
```
YES
1
aabbaa
NO
YES
1
aabb
```

The program incorrectly handles the string "aabbaa" by only considering the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring, instead of correctly partitioning it into "aab" and "baa". This shows that the program does not correctly handle all possible partitions of the string into non-palindromic substrings.
