Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` must be greater than 4, `done` is False, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only moves the control flow to the next iteration of the loop. Since there was no loop in the given code snippet, the values of all variables remain unchanged.
