Postcondition: `done` is still False, `count` is `n-1`, `count2` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is `t-1`, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first element of the list `s`. If `x` is not equal to the last element of the list `s`, the condition remains unchanged. If `x` is equal to the last element of the list `s`, the condition also remains unchanged since there is no else part that modifies the variables.
