Postcondition: **`n`, `j`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, and `s` are as follows: `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count + 2`, `done` remains True, `count` is equal to `j`, and `count2` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1). If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the loop is not continued.**
