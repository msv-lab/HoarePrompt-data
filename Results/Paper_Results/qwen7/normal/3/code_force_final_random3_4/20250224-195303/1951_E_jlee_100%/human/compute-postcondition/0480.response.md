Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is `s[0]`, `count` is 0, `count2` remains unchanged and is either less than or equal to `count`, and `done` is False.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or block of code. In this case, it exits the loop or block where `j` is being incremented and checked against `n`. Since `j` was 0 and the loop condition was that `j < n`, the loop would have continued until `j` reached `n`. However, the `break` statement breaks out of the loop immediately, setting `done` to `False`. The values of `s[j]`, `count`, `count2`, and `n` remain unchanged.
