Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string, `done` is True, `count` is `n-1`, `count2` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is `t-1`, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the list `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the length of the list `s` is stored in `n`, while the other variables retain their initial states.
