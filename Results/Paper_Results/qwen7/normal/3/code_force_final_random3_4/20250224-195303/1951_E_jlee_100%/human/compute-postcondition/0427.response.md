Postcondition: `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1. The current value of `count` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`.

Explanation: 
- If `count > 1`, then `done` is `True`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1. The current value of `count` is greater than 1, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, and `count2` is equal to `count`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `count <= 1`, then `count2` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, and the condition `count > 1` is false.
