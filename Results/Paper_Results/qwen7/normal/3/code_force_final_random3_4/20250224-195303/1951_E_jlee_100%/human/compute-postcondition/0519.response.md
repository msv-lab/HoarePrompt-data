Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[j]` is `s[1]`
- `count` is 1
- `count2` is either 0 or 1
- `done` is True

The key part of the code snippet is:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

Given that `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the substring from the start of `string` up to (but not including) the character at index 1. Since `j` is 1, this will be an empty string (`""`).

`string[j:]` will be the substring starting from index 1 to the end of the string.

Therefore, the print statement will output two parts: an empty string followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **"" [rest of the string starting from the second character]**
