Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string.
- `done` is `True`.
- `count` was `j`.
- The character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is greater than `count` and `count2` is not equal to `count`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
