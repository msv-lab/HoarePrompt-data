Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is False, and the current value of `x` is either not equal to the last element of `s` or there is no else part specified, meaning the conditions and values remain as they are after the if statement executes.
