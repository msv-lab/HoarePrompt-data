Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`
- `done` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1
- The current value of `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count2` is less than the current value of `count`

The `print(string[:j], string[j:])` statement will split the string `string` into two parts: from the start up to but not including `j`, and from `j` to the end of the string.

Given that `j` is `n-1`, the first part of the string will be everything up to the second-to-last character, and the second part will be the last character of the string.

Therefore, the output will be the string split at the second-to-last character.

Output: **string[:-1], string[-1]**
