Postcondition: `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `count` is incremented by 1, either `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and `done` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1 without changing the values of `s` and `done`.
