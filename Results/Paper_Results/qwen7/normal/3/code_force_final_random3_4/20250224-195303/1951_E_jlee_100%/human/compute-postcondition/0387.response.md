Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `j`, `n`, and the contents of the list `s`.

Output: **YES**
