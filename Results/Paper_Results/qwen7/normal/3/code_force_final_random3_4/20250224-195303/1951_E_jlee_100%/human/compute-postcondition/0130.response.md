Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count + 1`, `done` is True, `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided, the variables `n`, `j`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state retains the same conditions as the initial state.
