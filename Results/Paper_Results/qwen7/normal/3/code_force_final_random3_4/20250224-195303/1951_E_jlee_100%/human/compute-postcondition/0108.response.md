Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count`, `done` is True if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `done` is True or False depending on the original value, `count` is greater than 0, and `count2` is either greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1) or 0 (otherwise). Additionally, `s[j]` is either not equal to `x` or `count2` is increased by 1 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`.
