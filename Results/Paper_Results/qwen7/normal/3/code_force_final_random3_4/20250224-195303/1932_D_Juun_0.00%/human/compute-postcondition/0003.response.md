Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list.**

The code initializes the `answers` variable as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the `trump suit`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only change is that `answers` is now an empty list.
