Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State**: `trumps` is not an empty list.
   - This means `trumps` contains at least one element.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the list `trumps`.
   - The first `trumps.pop()` call removes and returns the last element of `trumps`.
   - The second `trumps.pop()` call removes and returns the new last element of `trumps` after the first pop operation.
   - `trump` is a variable whose value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, it remains as `trump`.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - Let's denote the elements of `trumps` as `trump1, trump2, ..., trumpN` where `N` is the number of elements in the list.
   - After the first `pop`, the last element (`trumpN`) is removed and returned.
   - After the second `pop`, the new last element (`trumpN-1`) is removed and returned.
   - The `print` statement then formats and prints the result as follows: `{last_element}{trump} {new_last_element}{trump}`.

Given the above steps, the output will be:

Output: **{last_element_of_trumps}{trump} {second_last_element_of_trumps}{trump}**
