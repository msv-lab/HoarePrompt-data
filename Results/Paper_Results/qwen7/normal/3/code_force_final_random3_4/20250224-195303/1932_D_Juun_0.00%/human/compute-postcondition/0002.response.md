Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", `trumps` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `trumps`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the trump suit remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables along with the newly created empty list `trumps`.
