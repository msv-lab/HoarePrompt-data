Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` dictionary keys are set to `None`, `answers` is a list containing 16 unique strings, each formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `trumps` is not an empty list. Since each iteration removes two elements from `trumps` (i.e., `trumps.pop()` is called twice per iteration), and there were initially 16 elements in `trumps` (since `answers` contains 16 unique strings), the loop will execute exactly 8 times (16 elements / 2 elements removed per iteration). After these 8 iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list. The other variables (`suits` and `answers`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `answer` is the first element in the `answers` list, `answers` is a list containing 16 unique strings, each formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `answer` is the second element in the `answers` list, `answers` is a list containing 15 unique strings, each formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `answer` is the third element in the `answers` list, `answers` is a list containing 15 unique strings, each formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
