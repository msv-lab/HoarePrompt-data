Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: `trumps` is not an empty list.
2. **Code Snippet**: 
   ```python
   print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`trumps.pop()`**: 
   - This method removes and returns the last element from the `trumps` list.
   - Let's denote the last element of `trumps` as `last_element`.

2. **`trump`**:
   - The variable `trump` is not defined in the initial state, so it remains as the variable name `trump`.

3. **First Part of the Print Statement**:
   - The first part of the formatted string is `f'{trumps.pop()}{trump}'`.
   - After the first `pop`, `trumps` will have one less element.
   - So, the first part becomes `last_element + trump`.

4. **Second Part of the Print Statement**:
   - The second part of the formatted string is `f'{trumps.pop()}{trump}'`.
   - After the second `pop`, `trumps` will be empty because it was not empty initially and two elements were popped.
   - The second part becomes the next-to-last element of the original `trumps` list plus `trump`.

### Final Output:

Given the above steps, the final output will be the concatenation of the last element of `trumps`, followed by `trump`, then a space, followed by the next-to-last element of `trumps`, and finally `trump`.

Output: **last_element + trump next_to_last_element + trump (where last_element is the last element of trumps, next_to_last_element is the second last element of trumps, and trump is the variable name)**
