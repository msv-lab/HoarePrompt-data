Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`, `answers` is an empty list, `card` is a tuple where the first element is assigned to `rank` and the second element is assigned to `suit`**.

The code appends the value of `rank` to the list `trumps`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
