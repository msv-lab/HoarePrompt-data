Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with the suit, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None except for the key `suit` which is now set to `None`, `rank` is the rank of the card, `suit` is the suit of the card, and `suit` is not equal to the trump suit.**

Explanation: The code `suits[suit] = None` sets the value of `suits[suit]` to `None`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
