Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: `trumps` is not an empty list.
   - This means `trumps` contains at least one element.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Execution**:
   - `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the list `trumps`.
   - The result of `trumps.pop()` is then concatenated with `trump`.
   - The next `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the new last element of the list `trumps` (which was the second-to-last element before the first pop).
   - The result of this second `trumps.pop()` is then concatenated with `trump`.

4. **Concatenation**:
   - Let's denote the elements of `trumps` as `[e1, e2, ..., en]` where `n` is the number of elements in the list.
   - After the first `pop`, the last element `en` is removed and returned.
   - After the second `pop`, the new last element `en-1` is removed and returned.
   - Therefore, the printed string will be `en + trump + en-1 + trump`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - Since the exact elements of `trumps` are not specified, we represent them as `en` and `en-1`.
   - `trump` is a variable whose value is not provided, so it remains as `trump`.

Given this analysis, the output will be:

Output: **en + trump + en-1 + trump** (where `en` is the last element of `trumps` before the first pop, `en-1` is the second-to-last element of `trumps` before the first pop, and `trump` is a variable).
