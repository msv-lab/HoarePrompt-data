Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios, particularly when there are multiple rounds where the second player uses a trump card to beat a non-trump card. Here's why the program fails:

1. **Handling Trump Cards**: The program tries to handle trump cards but does not ensure that the trump cards are used in the correct order. Specifically, after processing non-trump cards, it should use the remaining trump cards in ascending order. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this order.

2. **Multiple Rounds with Trumps**: When there are multiple rounds involving trump cards, the program might incorrectly pair trump cards with non-trump cards, leading to an invalid sequence.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where there are no valid sequences, such as when there are more non-trump cards than trump cards available to beat them.

To fix these issues, the program needs to ensure that:
- Non-trump cards are paired in the correct order.
- Trump cards are used in the correct order to beat non-trump cards.
- The program correctly handles cases where there are no valid sequences.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function `func_1` that addresses these issues:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    trump = input()
    cards = input().split()
    
    # Initialize data structures
    non_trump_cards = []
    trump_cards = []
    answers = []

    # Separate cards into non-trump and trump categories
    for card in cards:
        rank, suit = card
        if suit == trump:
            trump_cards.append((int(rank), card))
        else:
            non_trump_cards.append((int(rank), card))

    # Sort non-trump cards by rank
    non_trump_cards.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Process non-trump cards
    for (rank, card) in non_trump_cards:
        if trump_cards:
            # Use the smallest trump card to beat the current non-trump card
            trump_rank, trump_card = trump_cards.pop(0)
            answers.append(f'{card} {trump_card}')

    # Process remaining trump cards
    if trump_cards:
        if len(trump_cards) % 2 != 0:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        for i in range(0, len(trump_cards), 2):
            answers.append(f'{trump_cards[i][1]} {trump_cards[i+1][1]}')

    # Output the answers
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
```

This revised function ensures that non-trump cards are processed in the correct order and that trump cards are used to beat non-trump cards in the correct sequence.
