Postcondition: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all set to `None`; `trumps` is a list with one less element than before; `answers` is a list with one new element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'; the loop continues regardless of whether `rank` is `None` or not.
