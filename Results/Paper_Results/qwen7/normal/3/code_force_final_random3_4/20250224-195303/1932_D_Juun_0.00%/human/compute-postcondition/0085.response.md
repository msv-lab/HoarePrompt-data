Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `answers` is a list containing 15 unique strings, each formatted as `'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'`.
   - `answer` is the third element in the `answers` list.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(answer)
   ```

Given that `answer` is the third element in the `answers` list, we need to determine what the third element looks like. Since each element in the `answers` list is formatted as `'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'`, the third element would follow this pattern.

Therefore, the third element in the `answers` list is:
```python
'rank2 trumps.pop()trump'
```

When the `print(answer)` statement is executed, it will print this string.

Output: **'rank2 trumps.pop()trump'**
