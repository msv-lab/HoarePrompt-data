Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all to None, `rank` is None, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement in the code does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next one. Therefore, the values of `suits` and `rank` remain unchanged from their initial states.
