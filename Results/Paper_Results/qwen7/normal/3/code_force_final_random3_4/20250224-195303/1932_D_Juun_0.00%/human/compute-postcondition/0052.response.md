Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all set to `None`; `trumps` is a list with one less element than before; `answers` is a list with one new element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'; the loop continues.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `suits`, `trumps`, or `answers`, their states remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement. The only effect is that the loop will continue to the next iteration.
