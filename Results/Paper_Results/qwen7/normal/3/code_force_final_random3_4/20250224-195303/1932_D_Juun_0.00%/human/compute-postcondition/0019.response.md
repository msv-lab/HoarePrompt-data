Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS". If the suit of the card is equal to the trump suit, `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank`, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None. If the suit of the card is not equal to the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with the suit, `trumps` is an empty list, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values where either all are set to `rank` or the key `suit` is set to `None`.
