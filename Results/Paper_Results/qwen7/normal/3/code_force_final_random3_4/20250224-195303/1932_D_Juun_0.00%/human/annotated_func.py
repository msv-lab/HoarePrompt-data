#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and the third line contains 2n unique cards described by two-character strings where the first character is the rank ("23456789") and the second character is the suit ("CDHS").
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS". `trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that had the same suit as the trump suit, sorted in ascending order. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`. `answers` is a list containing strings formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` for each suit in 'CDHS', where each string is formed only once per unique pair of `suits[suit]` and `rank`.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: All keys in the `suits` dictionary are set to `None`; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is a list containing 16 unique strings, each formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` dictionary keys are set to `None`, `answers` is a list containing 16 unique strings, each formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `trumps` is not an empty list. Since each iteration removes two elements from `trumps` (i.e., `trumps.pop()` is called twice per iteration), and there were initially 16 elements in `trumps` (since `answers` contains 16 unique strings), the loop will execute exactly 8 times (16 elements / 2 elements removed per iteration). After these 8 iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list. The other variables (`suits` and `answers`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: `answer` is the eighth element in the `answers` list, `answers` is a list containing 15 unique strings, each formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump', `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` dictionary keys are set to `None`.
    #
    #Explanation: After 8 iterations of the loop, all 16 elements from the `answers` list have been printed, with two elements being processed in each iteration. Therefore, `answer` will be the eighth element in the original `answers` list. The `trumps` list is emptied after 8 iterations since 16 elements were removed (2 per iteration). The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The `answers` list is reduced to 15 elements after the last iteration, as 16 - 8 (iterations) * 2 (elements per iteration) = 0 elements remain.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input data related to a card game, specifically dealing with a set of cards and a trump suit. It updates the `suits` dictionary to have all values set to `None`, modifies the `trumps` list to have one less element, and constructs the `answers` list with formatted strings based on certain conditions. The function prints the contents of `answers` and `trumps` in a specific order and returns `None`.
