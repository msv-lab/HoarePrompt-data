Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n; `new_arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `new_arr` as an empty list. It does not modify the existing `arr` list or assign any new values to it. Therefore, the state of `arr` remains unchanged, and only `new_arr` is updated to be an empty list.
