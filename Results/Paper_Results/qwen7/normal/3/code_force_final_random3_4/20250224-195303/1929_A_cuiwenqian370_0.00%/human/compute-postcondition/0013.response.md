Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` is `right - 1`, and `new_arr` is a list containing either the element `arr[1]` (if `left` equals `right`) or the elements `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` (if `left` does not equal `right`).**

Explanation: The value of `right` is decremented by 1. The initial state of `left` remains unchanged, and the condition for `new_arr` depends on whether `left` equals `right`. Since `right` was initially greater than or equal to 0, the new value of `right` is now `right - 1`. The description of `new_arr` remains the same as per the initial conditions.
