Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` is `right - 1`, `new_arr` is a list containing either the element `arr[1]` (if `left` equals `right`) or the elements `arr[1]` and `arr[1]` (if `left` does not equal `right`).**

Explanation: The value of `right` is decremented by 1. The initial state of `left` is 2, and `right` is at least 1. The value of `new_arr` remains unchanged because the operation only affects `right`.
