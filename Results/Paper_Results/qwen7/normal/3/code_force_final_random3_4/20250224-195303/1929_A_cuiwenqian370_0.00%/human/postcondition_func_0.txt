The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `arr` of `n` integers (each between 1 and 10^9). It first sorts the list `arr`. Then, it creates a new list `new_arr` by appending elements from the end and start of the sorted `arr` alternately until all elements are used. If the length of `arr` is odd, the middle element is placed at the end. Finally, it calculates the maximum beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between every consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`, and returns this value.
