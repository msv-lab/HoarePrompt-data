Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `left <= right`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `left` is 1.
   - `right` is `right - 1`.
   - `new_arr` is a list containing either the element `arr[1]` (if `left` equals `right`) or the elements `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` (if `left` does not equal `right`).

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `left <= right` must be true.
   - Given that `left` is currently 1, `right` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `right` is set to `right - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `right` must be adjusted to ensure `left <= right` holds true.
   - To satisfy `left <= right` with `left` being 1, `right` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `right` is at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`left` is 1, `right` must be at least 1, and `new_arr` is a list containing either the element `arr[1]` (if `left` equals `right`) or the elements `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` (if `left` does not equal `right`).**
