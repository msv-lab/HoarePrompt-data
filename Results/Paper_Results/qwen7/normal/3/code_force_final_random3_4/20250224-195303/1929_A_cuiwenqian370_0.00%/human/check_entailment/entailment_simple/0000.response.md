Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
3. The `func_1` function is designed to rearrange the array to maximize the beauty.
4. In `func_1`, the array is sorted and then rearranged by appending elements from both ends towards the center. This ensures that the largest and smallest values are paired together, maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.
5. The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.
6. The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty by ensuring the largest and smallest values are adjacent as much as possible.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
