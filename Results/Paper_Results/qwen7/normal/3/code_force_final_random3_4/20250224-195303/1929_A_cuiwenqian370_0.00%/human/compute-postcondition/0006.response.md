Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_arr` is a list containing the element `arr[0]`, and `left` is equal to `right`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `left` (which is `arr[0]`) to the list `new_arr`. Since `left` was initially equal to `right`, and no changes were made to `right`, `right` remains unchanged. `left` is incremented implicitly by the append operation, but since the initial condition was `left == right`, `left` is still equal to `right` after the operation.
