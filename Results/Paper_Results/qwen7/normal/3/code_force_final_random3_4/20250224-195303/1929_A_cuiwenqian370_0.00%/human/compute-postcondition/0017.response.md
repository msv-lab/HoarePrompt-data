Output State: **`left` is 1; `right` must be at least 1; `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[1]` and `arr[1]` is appended.**

Explanation: The code appends `arr[left]` to `new_arr`. Given that `left` is 1, `new_arr` now contains `arr[1]` in addition to its original element, which was `arr[right]`. Since `right` must be at least 1, the updated state includes `left` being 1, `right` being at least 1, and `new_arr` now holding both `arr[right]` and `arr[1]`.
