Output State: **`left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, and `new_arr` contains elements from `arr` in the described order.**

Explanation: The code initializes `max_beauty` to 0, which does not affect the values of `left`, `right`, or `new_arr`. The loop conditions and operations remain unchanged. After the loop completes, `left` will be equal to `n` and `right` will be `-1` as per the initial description. The `new_arr` will contain all elements from `arr` in the specified order, which is unaffected by the initialization of `max_beauty`.
