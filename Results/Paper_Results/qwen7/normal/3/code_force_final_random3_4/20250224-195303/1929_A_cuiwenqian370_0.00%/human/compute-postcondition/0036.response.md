Output State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`, `i` is `k + 2`**.

Explanation: The code increases `max_beauty` by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`. The value of `i` is updated to `k + 1` from the previous iteration, so in the current iteration, `i` is `k + 2`. The initial conditions and the relationship between `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
