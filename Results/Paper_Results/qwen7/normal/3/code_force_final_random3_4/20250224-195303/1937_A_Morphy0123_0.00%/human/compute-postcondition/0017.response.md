Based on the initial state provided:

- `power` is explicitly given as 4.
- `n` is greater than 8 but its exact value is not needed since it does not affect the calculation of `2 ** power`.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), but again, its value is not needed.
- `n_cases` is greater than 0 but not needed for this specific print statement.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is not equal to 1 but its exact value is not required for the calculation.
- The current value of `power` is equal to `n`, but since `power` is explicitly 4, `n` must also be 4.

The print statement is `print(2 ** power)`. Given that `power` is 4, the expression `2 ** power` evaluates to \(2^4 = 16\).

Output: **16**
