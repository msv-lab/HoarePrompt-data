Output State: `power` is 5, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 2 or 5, `n` must be greater than 8.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until it is no longer less than `log2(n)`. Given that the `power` value increases by 1 each iteration and reaches 4 after 3 iterations, it will reach 5 after 4 iterations. The conditions for the other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
