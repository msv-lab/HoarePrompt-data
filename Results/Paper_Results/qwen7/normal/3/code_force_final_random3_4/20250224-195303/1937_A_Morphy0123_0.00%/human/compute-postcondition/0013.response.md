Output State: **`power` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 4, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The variable `power` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged from the initial state.
