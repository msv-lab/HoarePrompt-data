Given the initial state:
- `power` is 4
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n_cases` must be greater than 5
- `i` is either 2 or 5
- `n` must be greater than 8
- `power` is not equal to `n`

We need to evaluate the expression `2 ** power`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `power` is explicitly given as 4.

Therefore, the expression `2 ** power` translates to `2 ** 4`.

Calculating this:
\[ 2 ** 4 = 16 \]

So, the print statement will output the value 16.

Output: **16**
