Output State: **`power` is 4, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 2 or 5, `n` must be greater than 8, and `power` is not equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The value of `power` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 5 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
