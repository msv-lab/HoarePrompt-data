Output: **1**

Explanation: The print statement `print(1)` directly prints the integer 1. None of the other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, `n`, `power`) affect this print statement because the statement itself does not reference any of them. The conditions and values of these variables do not change the fact that the print statement outputs the integer 1.
