Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n_cases)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n_cases`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n_cases`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as follows:
     - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
     - `n_cases` must be greater than 5.
     - `i` is either 2 or 5.
     - `n` is an input integer.
     - `power` is an integer.
     - `n` must be greater than 8 if `i` is 5.
     - If `n` equals 1, then `power` remains 4. Otherwise, `power` is 4 if it does not equal `n`, and remains 5 if it does equal `n`.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n_cases`, we need to increment `i` by 1.
   - `n_cases` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop.

4. **Check the conditions for `i` and `n`**:
   - If `i` was 2, after incrementing, `i` becomes 3.
   - If `i` was 5, after incrementing, `i` becomes 6.
   - `n` and `power` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise by the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they stay the same.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n_cases` remains the same.
   - `n` and `power` remain unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 3 or 6 (depending on the previous value of `i`), `n` is an input integer, `power` is an integer, and `n` must be greater than 8 if `i` is 6. If `n` equals 1, then `power` remains 4. Otherwise, `power` is 4 if it does not equal `n`, and remains 5 if it does equal `n`.**

To summarize the specific state:

- If `i` was 2, then `i` is now 3.
- If `i` was 5, then `i` is now 6.

So, the final state is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 3 or 6, `n` is an input integer, `power` is an integer, and `n` must be greater than 8 if `i` is 6. If `n` equals 1, then `power` remains 4. Otherwise, `power` is 4 if it does not equal `n`, and remains 5 if it does equal `n`.**
