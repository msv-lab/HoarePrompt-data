Output State: `power` is 5, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 2 or 5, `n` must be greater than 8.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`. Given that the loop executes 3 times to reach `power` as 4, it will execute one more time to reach `power` as 5. The conditions for `t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
