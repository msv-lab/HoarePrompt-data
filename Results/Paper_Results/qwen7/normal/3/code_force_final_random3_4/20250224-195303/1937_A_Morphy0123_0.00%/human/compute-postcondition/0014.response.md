Output State: `power` is 4, `n` must be greater than 8, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is not equal to 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than \(\log_2(n)\). After the loop has executed 3 times, `power` is 3. For the loop to execute a fourth time, `power` would need to be incremented again, making it 4. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `power` will be 4. Additionally, since the loop condition checks if `power` is less than \(\log_2(n)\), and `power` is now 4, it implies that \(2^4 = 16\) must be greater than or equal to \(n\), meaning \(n\) must be greater than 8. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
