Postcondition: **`power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 3 or 6, and `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than 128. If `power` equals `n`, then `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is adjusted to be within the range `[log2(n) - 1, log2(n))`.**
