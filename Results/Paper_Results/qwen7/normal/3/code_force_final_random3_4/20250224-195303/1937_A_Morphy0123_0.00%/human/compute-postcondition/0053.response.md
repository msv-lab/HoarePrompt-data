`power` is incremented by 1. Initially, `power` is 4 if `n` does not equal `n` (which is always true since `n` is not equal to itself) and remains 5 if `n` equals `n` (which is also always true). Since `power` is initially 5, it will become 6. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `power` is 6; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n_cases` must be greater than 5; `i` is either 3 or 6; `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than 2.
