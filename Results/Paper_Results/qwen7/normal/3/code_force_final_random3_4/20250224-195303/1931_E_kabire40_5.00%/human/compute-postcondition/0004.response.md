Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `y` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string**.

Explanation: The code `operational_list = input().split()` takes an input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The original values of `t`, `y`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, and `max_power` remain unchanged. The new variable `operational_list` is created and assigned the result of the split operation.
