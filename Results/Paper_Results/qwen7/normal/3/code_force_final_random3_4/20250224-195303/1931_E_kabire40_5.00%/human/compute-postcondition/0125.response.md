Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list` and `x_rev` is calculated as the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`.**

In this output state, the `operational_list` remains unchanged, `x` remains the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`, and `x_rev` is updated to be the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`.
