Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least one string; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`; `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reverse of the string `x` to the list `rev_val`. The initial state of `operational_list` and `x_rev` remains unchanged. The new information is that `rev_val` now contains the reverse of `x`.
