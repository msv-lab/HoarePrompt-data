Postcondition: `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed strings from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string matches the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of those integers, `x` is 0, and `len(rev_val)` must be at least 1. The current value of `x` is 0 and it satisfies the condition `x % 2 == 0`.
