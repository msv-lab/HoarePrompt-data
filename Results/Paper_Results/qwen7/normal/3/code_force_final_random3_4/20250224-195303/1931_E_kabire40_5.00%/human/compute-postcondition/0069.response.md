Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the list, `rev_res` is equal to `rev_res` plus `x_rev`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` adds the value of `x_rev` (which is the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the list) to `rev_res`. Since the initial value of `rev_res` is not specified, it remains as `rev_res` plus the value of `x_rev`. The other variables remain unchanged.
