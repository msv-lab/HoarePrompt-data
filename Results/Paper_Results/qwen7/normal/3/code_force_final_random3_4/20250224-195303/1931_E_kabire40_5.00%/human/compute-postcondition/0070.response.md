Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the list, and `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the first string in `operational_list`.**

Explanation: The code appends the reverse of the first string in `operational_list` to the list `rev_val`. Since `x_rev` is defined as the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the list, it remains unchanged. The first string in `operational_list` is reversed and added to `rev_val` as a string.
