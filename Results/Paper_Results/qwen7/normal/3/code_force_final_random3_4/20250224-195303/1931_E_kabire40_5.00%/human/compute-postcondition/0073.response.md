Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `operational_list`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in `operational_list`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string.
   - `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the first string in the list.
   - If the length of `x_rev` as a string is equal to the length of the first string in `operational_list`, `rev_res` is equal to `rev_res` plus `x_rev`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the first string in `operational_list`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each string in `operational_list`, the next string in the list will be processed.
   - Therefore, `operational_list` will now be the list without the first string (the one that was just processed).
   - `x` will be the next string in the list.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `operational_list` will now be a list of strings that must have at least 0 strings (since it loses its first string).
   - `x` will be the next string in the list.
   - `x_rev` will be the integer value of the reverse of this new first string.
   - `rev_res` and `rev_val` will remain unchanged from the previous iteration unless the new `x` satisfies the condition for updating `rev_res`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 0 strings, `x` is the next string in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of this new first string, `rev_res` is unchanged, and `rev_val` is unchanged.**
