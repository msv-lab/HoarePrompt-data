Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x`, which is iterating over `operational_list`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: 
   - `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `x` is the variable that will take each element from `operational_list` during each iteration.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `operational_list`. Once `operational_list` is exhausted, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on `operational_list` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `operational_list` has at least one string. The other variables (`t`, `y`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, `max_power`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute and can remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `operational_list` must have at least one string.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least one string**.
