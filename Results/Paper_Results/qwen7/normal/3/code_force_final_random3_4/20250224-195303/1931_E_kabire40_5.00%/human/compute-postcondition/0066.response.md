Postcondition: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`. If the length of `x` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x_rev`, then `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.
