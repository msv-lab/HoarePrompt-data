Based on the initial state provided:

- `rev_res` is a string that alternates between the integer values of `rev_val` and their reversed forms, starting with the first element of `rev_val` and ending with its last element.
- The value of `10` is not directly related to the `print` statement, so it seems there might be a misunderstanding or missing context regarding `10`.

Given the `print('Anna')` statement, the output will be the string "Anna".

Output: **Anna**
