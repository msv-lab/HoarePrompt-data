Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`; `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` updates the value of `rev_res` by adding the integer value of `x` (which is the reverse of the string `x`) to the current value of `rev_res`. The other variables remain unchanged.
