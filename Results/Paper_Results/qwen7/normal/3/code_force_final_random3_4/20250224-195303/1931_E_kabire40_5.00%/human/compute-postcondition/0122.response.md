Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one element, `x` is the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, and `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`, and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed integer of the first element of `operational_list`.**

Explanation: The code appends the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list` to the list `rev_val`. Since `x` is the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer and `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`, appending `x[::-1]` (which is equivalent to `x_rev`) to `rev_val` means `rev_val` now contains `x_rev`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
