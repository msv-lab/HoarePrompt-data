Output State: **`rev_res` is the sum of the integers in `rev_val` with the additional value of either the integer value of `rev_val[x+1]` (if `x+1` is even) or the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x+1]` (if `x+1` is odd), `rev_val` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `val_in` is `rev_val[x]`; `rev_res` is updated by adding the reverse of `val_in`.**

This means that `rev_res` has been updated by adding the reverse of `val_in` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
