Output State: **`rev_val` is an empty list, `y` is `n`, `max_power` is the second input value, `list_len` is the first input value, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `operational_list = input().split()` takes an input string from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `operational_list`. The other variables (`rev_val`, `y`, `max_power`, and `list_len`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
