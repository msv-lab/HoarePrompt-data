Output State: **`x` is 3; `rev_res` is the string '3' appended to the previous value of `rev_res`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += str(val_in)` appends the string representation of `val_in` to `rev_res`. Given that `val_in` is an integer and its string representation is '3', `rev_res` is updated by appending '3' to its current value. Since no initial value for `rev_res` was given, we assume it was empty before this operation, making the new value of `rev_res` simply '3'. The value of `x` remains unchanged.
