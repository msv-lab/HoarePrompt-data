Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `operational_list` will be an empty list since each string in it has been processed. `rev_res` will be a string that consists of all the integers converted from the reversed strings of `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string matches the original string's length. `rev_val` will be a list containing the integers converted from the reversed strings of `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string does not match the original string's length.**

This means that after processing all strings in `operational_list`, `rev_res` will contain concatenated results of those strings whose reversed form has the same length as the original string, and `rev_val` will contain the reversed and integer-converted forms of those strings whose reversed form has a different length than the original string.
