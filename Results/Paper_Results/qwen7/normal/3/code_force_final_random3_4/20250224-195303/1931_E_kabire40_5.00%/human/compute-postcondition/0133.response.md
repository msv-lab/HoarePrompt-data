Postcondition: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least two elements, `x` is the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `x_rev` is doubled. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`.**
