Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `x`: This is the variable that will take each element from `operational_list`.
   - `operational_list`: This is the list that `x` will iterate over.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `rev_val` is an empty list.
   - `y` is `n`.
   - `max_power` is the second input value.
   - `list_len` is the first input value.
   - `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `operational_list`.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant objects**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `operational_list`, the list must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, `operational_list` must have at least one string.
   - The other variables (`rev_val`, `y`, `max_power`, `list_len`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 string**.
