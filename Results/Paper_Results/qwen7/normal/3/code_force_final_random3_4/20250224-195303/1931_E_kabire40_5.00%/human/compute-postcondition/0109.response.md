Postcondition: `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the concatenation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]` (if `x` is even) or the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x]` (if `x` is odd) for each iteration from `x = 0` to `x = len(rev_val) - 1`. This holds true regardless of whether `10^{int(max_power)}` is less than or equal to `rev_res` or not.
