Output State: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the reversed strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, `y` remains 1, and `rev_res` is updated by adding either the integer value of the current element in `rev_val` (if `x` is even) or the reverse of the current element in `rev_val` (if `x` is odd) to it after all iterations of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `rev_res` will be the final accumulated result based on the rules specified in the loop body. The variable `y` will still be 1, and `rev_val` will contain the sorted list of reversed integers from the strings in `operational_list` that meet the specified conditions.
