Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is calculated as the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`, and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x` as an integer.**

Explanation: The code appends the reversed string of `x` (which is already defined as the integer representation of the reversed second element of `operational_list`) to the list `rev_val`. Since `x` is already an integer, reversing it again would just give us `x` itself as a string, which is then converted back to an integer and appended to `rev_val`. The other variables remain unchanged.
