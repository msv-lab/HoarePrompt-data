Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `y` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string**.

Explanation: The code assigns an empty string to `rev_res`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `y`, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `y` remains 0, and `rev_res` is now an empty string.
