Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least two strings; `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus `x`, where `x` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `rev_res = rev_res + x` updates the value of `rev_res` by adding the current value of `x` to it. Here, `x` is defined as the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`. However, since the initial value of `x` is not specified, we keep it in terms of its definition. The operational list and the variable `x_rev` remain unchanged.
