Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The line `answers.append('Alice')` adds the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `i` is set to 1. After executing the append operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (though not explicitly shown in the code snippet, it's implied by the context), making `i` equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
