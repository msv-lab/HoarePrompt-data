Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list with 'Draw' appended, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The line `answers.append('Draw')` appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `i`, and `clues`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
