Output State: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. Clues[3] is less than or equal to 1 away from clues[5]. Clues[2] is greater than or equal to 1 away from clues[4]. Clues[2] is even and clues[4] is even, or clues[2] is odd and clues[4] is odd. Additionally, `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` is less than or equal to `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` and `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is less than or equal to `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`**.

The code appends the string 'Alice' to the list `answers`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
