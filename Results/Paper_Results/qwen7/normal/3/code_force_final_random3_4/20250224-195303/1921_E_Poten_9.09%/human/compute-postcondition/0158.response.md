Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `i` is set to 1. After executing `answers.append('Alice')`, `i` is incremented to 2 (since no explicit increment was given, it's implied by the problem context). All other variables remain unchanged.
