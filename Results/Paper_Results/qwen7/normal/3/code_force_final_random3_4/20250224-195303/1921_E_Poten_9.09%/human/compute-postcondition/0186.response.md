Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list with 'Bob' appended to it, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. The values of `test_cases` and `i` remain unchanged, and `clues` remains as a list of integers obtained from the input string.
