Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Alice')` appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `i` is set to 1. After executing the line of code, `i` is incremented by 1 (since no explicit increment operation was given, we assume it's part of a loop or context where `i` would naturally be incremented). Therefore, `i` becomes 2. All other variables retain their initial states.
