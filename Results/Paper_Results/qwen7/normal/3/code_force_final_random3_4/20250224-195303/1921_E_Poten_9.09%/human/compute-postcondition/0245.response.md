Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. For each test case, it determines whether Alice, Bob, or a Draw occurs based on specific conditions involving the parity of h and w, and the relative positions of x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b. The function outputs the result for each test case in the form of 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'.**
