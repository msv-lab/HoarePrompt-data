Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list with 'Draw' appended to it, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues` remain unchanged. Therefore, `test_cases` remains an integer within the specified range, `i` stays as 3, and `answers` now includes the string `'Draw'`.
