Postcondition: `test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and either `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`, or `clues[2]` is not greater than `clues[4]`, or `clues[2]` is not odd while `clues[4]` is even, or `clues[2]` is not even while `clues[4]` is odd.
