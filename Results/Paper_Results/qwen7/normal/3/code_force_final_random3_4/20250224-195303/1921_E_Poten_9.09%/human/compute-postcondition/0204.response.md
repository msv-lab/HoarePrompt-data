Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list. If `clues[3] < clues[5]`, then `answers` is a list with either 'Draw' or 'Bob' appended to it. Otherwise, if `clues[3] > clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.
