Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. The condition is met either when the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues` or when the first element of `clues` is equal to 1.**
