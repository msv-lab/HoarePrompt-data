Output State: **`i` is `test_cases - 1`, `answers` is a list containing the results for each of the `test_cases` according to the rules defined in the loop.**

In Natural Language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `test_cases - 1` because the loop decrements `i` in each iteration until it reaches 0. The `answers` list will contain the outcome ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') for each of the `test_cases` based on the conditions specified in the loop body. Since the loop processes all `test_cases`, `answers` will have exactly `test_cases` elements, each representing the result for one test case.
