Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list, and `clues` remains a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. If `clues[3] > clues[5]`, then `answers` will have either 'Draw' or 'Alice' appended to it based on the condition `clues[5] - 1 - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`. If the condition is not met, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] <= clues[5]`, no additional elements are appended to `answers`.
