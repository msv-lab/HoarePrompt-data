Postcondition: `test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and `clues[3]` - `clues[5]` - 1 is less than or equal to abs((`clues[2]` - `clues[4]`) // 2) and `clues[5]` - 1 - 1 is less than or equal to abs((`clues[2]` - `clues[4]`) // 2).
