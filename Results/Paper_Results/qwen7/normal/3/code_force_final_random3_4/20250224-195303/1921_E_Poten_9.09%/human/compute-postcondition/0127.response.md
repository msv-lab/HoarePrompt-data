Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `i` is set to 1. After executing `answers.append('Draw')`, `i` is incremented to 2 (assuming `i` is incremented elsewhere in the code). The values of `test_cases` and `clues` remain unchanged.
