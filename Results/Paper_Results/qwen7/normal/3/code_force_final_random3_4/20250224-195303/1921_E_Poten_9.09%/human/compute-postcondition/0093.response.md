Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. Depending on the conditions, `answers` will contain either 'Draw' or 'Alice'. Specifically, if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, and certain additional conditions involving `clues[1]`, `clues[2]`, `clues[3]`, `clues[4]`, and `clues[5]` are met, `answers` will contain 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` will contain 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then `answers` will be determined by the parity of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, and the differences between `clues[1]`, `clues[2]`, `clues[3]`, `clues[4]`, and `clues[5]`.**
