Output State: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, Clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4], clues[0] is not equal to 1, and either both clues[2] and clues[4] are even or both are odd. Additionally, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. The condition `(clues[1] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The conditions involving the list `clues` also remain valid as no changes were made to its elements.
