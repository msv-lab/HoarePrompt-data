You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. For each test case, it determines whether Alice, Bob, or a Draw occurs based on specific conditions involving the parity of h and w, and the relative positions of x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b. The function outputs the result for each test case in the form of 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It splits the input into individual variables for `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if Alice's chip is in the last row (`x_a == h`). If so, it immediately appends "Draw" to the answers list.
   - The program also checks if both Alice and Bob start in the same row but different columns. If so, it immediately appends "Draw" to the answers list.

3. **Parity Check**:
   - The program checks the parity (even/odd nature) of the initial positions of Alice and Bob's chips.
   - If both are even or both are odd, it proceeds to further checks.
   - If one is even and the other is odd, it directly appends "Alice" to the answers list.

4. **Further Checks Based on Parity**:
   - The program then checks the relative positions of Alice and Bob's chips.
   - Depending on whether Alice's column position is less than or greater than Bob's column position, it performs additional checks to determine the winner or if the game is a draw.

5. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the absolute difference between the columns is more than 1.
   - It checks if the distance between the current positions of Alice and Bob is within the bounds of optimal moves.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of Correctness:

The program appears to handle the basic logic correctly for determining the game outcome based on the given rules. However, there are some potential issues with the logic that need to be verified against the problem statement and examples.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Parity Check Logic**:
   - The logic for checking parity and appending "Alice" or "Bob" directly might not cover all edge cases correctly. For instance, if Alice's chip is in an even row and Bob's in an odd row, the program should consider the relative positions and moves carefully.

2. **Column Position Checks**:
   - The checks for column positions and distances seem overly complex and might not cover all scenarios correctly. The program should ensure that the relative positions and moves are handled accurately.

3. **Draw Conditions**:
   - The draw conditions are not clearly defined in the provided code. The program should ensure that all draw conditions are correctly identified.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program, it seems to follow the logic correctly but might have some issues with edge cases and complexity in handling certain scenarios. Given the complexity and the need for thorough testing, we cannot definitively say the program is fully correct without further testing against all edge cases.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

The program needs further refinement and testing to ensure it handles all edge cases and scenarios correctly.
