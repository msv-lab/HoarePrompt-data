Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. Clues[3] is less than clues[5], and the absolute difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than 1. Clues[2] is greater than clues[4], or clues[2] is odd while clues[4] is even, or clues[2] is even while clues[4] is odd. Additionally, if the difference between clues[1] and clues[5] is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between clues[2] and clues[4], or the difference between clues[5] and clues[3] is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between clues[2] and clues[4], then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.**
