Output State: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `clues`. The initial values of `test_cases`, `answers`, and `i` remain unchanged.
