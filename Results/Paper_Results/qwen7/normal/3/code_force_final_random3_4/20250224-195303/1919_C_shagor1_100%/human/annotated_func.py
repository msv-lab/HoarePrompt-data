#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n. It checks if the conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n are satisfied for all i from 1 to n. If these conditions are met for all test cases (with a maximum of 10^4 test cases), the function returns a result based on the provided data.
