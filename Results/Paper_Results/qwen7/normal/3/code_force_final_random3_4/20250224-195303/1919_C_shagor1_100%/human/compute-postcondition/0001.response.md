Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. Each test case includes an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n. For each test case, if the conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n are met for all i from 1 to n, and given that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 where t represents the number of test cases, the function returns a result based on the provided data.**

Note: The actual return value is not specified in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the input processing rather than the exact return value.
