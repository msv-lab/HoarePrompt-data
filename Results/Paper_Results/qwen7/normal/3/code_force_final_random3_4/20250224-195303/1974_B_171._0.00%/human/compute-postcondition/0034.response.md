Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):`. The variable `c` is being iterated over in this range.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `c` is 97 (which corresponds to 'a')
   - The character corresponding to `c` ('a') is not in the values of `mapping`

3. **Determine the Next Value of `c`**: The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. Since `c` is currently 97 (which is `ord('a')`), the next value of `c` would be `ord('b')`, which is 98.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the character corresponding to `c` (which will be 'b' when `c` is 98) should not be in the values of `mapping`.

5. **Adjust the State**: We need to update the state to reflect the next value of `c` and ensure that the condition for the next iteration is met.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`c` is 98, and the character corresponding to `c` ('b') is not in the values of `mapping`**
