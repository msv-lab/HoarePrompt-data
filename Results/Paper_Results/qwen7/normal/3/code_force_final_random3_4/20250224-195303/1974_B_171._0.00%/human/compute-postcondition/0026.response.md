Output State: **`encoded` is now a non-empty string (one character shorter) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 - 1 \); `decoded` is a list where each character in the original `encoded` string, except the first one, has been appended to according to the `mapping`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `decoded.append(mapping[char])` appends the mapped character to the `decoded` list for every character in the `encoded` string except the first one. The `encoded` string is reduced by one character since it is implied that the operation is performed on a sliding window or similar mechanism that removes one character from the string. The `decoded` list is updated by appending the mapped character corresponding to each character in the `encoded` string (except the first one).
