Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 97, `mapping['a']` is 'a'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the character 'a' to the key `'a'` in the dictionary `mapping`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `c` is 97, which corresponds to the character 'a', the mapping now includes `mapping['a'] = 'a'`. All other conditions and values of the initial state are preserved.
