Output State: **`c` is 100; `char` remains unchanged; `encoded` remains unchanged; `mapping[chr(99)]` is assigned the value of `char`; `mapping[chr(100)]` is assigned the value of `char`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `mapping` dictionary such that the key `chr(100)`, which is 'd', is assigned the value of `char`. Additionally, since `chr(99)` is not specified in the mapping, it is also assigned the value of `char`. All other variables remain unchanged.
