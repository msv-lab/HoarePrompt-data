Postcondition: `encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 97, and either `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()` (in which case no changes are made to `mapping`), or `mapping['a']` is updated to 'a' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
