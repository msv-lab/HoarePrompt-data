Output State: **`c` is 98; `mapping['b']` is `char`; 'b' is not in the values of `mapping`**

Explanation: The code `mapping[chr(c)] = char` updates the dictionary `mapping` by setting the key `chr(c)` (which is `'b'` since `c` is 98) to the value `char`. The condition that `'b'` is not in the values of `mapping` remains true because the assignment does not affect the existing values in the dictionary.
