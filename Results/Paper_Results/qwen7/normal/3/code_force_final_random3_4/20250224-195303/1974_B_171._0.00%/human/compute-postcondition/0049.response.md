Output State: **`encoded` is now a non-empty string (two characters shorter) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 - 2 \); `decoded` is a list where each character in the original `encoded` string, except the first two, has been appended to according to the `mapping`, and `decoded` now contains one additional element.**

Explanation: The code snippet `decoded.append(mapping[char])` appends the mapped character of `char` from the `mapping` to the `decoded` list. Since `char` is a character from the `encoded` string, excluding the first two characters, the `decoded` list gets one more element added to it. The length of `encoded` decreases by 2 because the first two characters are not being processed in this line of code. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
