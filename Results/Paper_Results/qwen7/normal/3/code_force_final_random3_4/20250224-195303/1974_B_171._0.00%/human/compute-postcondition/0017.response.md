Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `c` and `char` and `encoded` and `mapping`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. This means `c` takes values from 97 to 122 (inclusive).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is 99
   - `char` remains unchanged
   - `encoded` remains unchanged
   - `mapping` is updated such that `mapping[chr(98)]` is assigned the value of `char` if `chr(98)` is not already a value in `mapping`

4. **Determine the next value of `c`**: Since `c` is currently 99, the next value it will take is 100, which corresponds to the character 'd'.

5. **Check the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - `c` will be 100
   - `char` remains unchanged
   - `encoded` remains unchanged
   - `mapping` needs to be checked for the new value of `c` (which is 100) to ensure it follows the same update rule.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `c` will be 100
   - `char` remains unchanged
   - `encoded` remains unchanged
   - `mapping` will be updated such that `mapping[chr(99)]` is assigned the value of `char` if `chr(99)` is not already a value in `mapping`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`c` is 100, `char` remains unchanged, `encoded` remains unchanged, and `mapping` is updated such that `mapping[chr(99)]` is assigned the value of `char` if `chr(99)` is not already a value in `mapping`.**
