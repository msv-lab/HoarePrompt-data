Postcondition: `encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `decoded` is a list where each element is either the mapped value of a character from `encoded` according to `mapping`, or a character from 'a' to 'z' that was not found in `mapping`.
