Output State: **`mapping[chr(98)]` is assigned the value of `char`. `c` is now 99, `char` remains unchanged, `encoded` remains unchanged, and `mapping` remains unchanged except for the new entry.**

This means that the character corresponding to the ASCII value 98 (which is 'b') in the `mapping` dictionary is now associated with the value of `char`. The variable `c` is incremented by 1, so it is now 99. The values of `char`, `encoded`, and the rest of the `mapping` dictionary remain unchanged.
