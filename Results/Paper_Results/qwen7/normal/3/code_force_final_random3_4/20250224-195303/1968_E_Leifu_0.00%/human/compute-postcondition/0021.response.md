Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is an input integer between 1 and 50, and the value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is set to 1.
