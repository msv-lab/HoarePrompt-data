Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `j` is `n + 1`
  - `n` is the same as before

- **For loop statement:**
  ```python
  for j in range(4, n + 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for values of `j` starting from 4 up to (but not including) `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `n + 1`.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the range `4` to `n`.
   - Since `j` was `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means `j` is currently out of the range defined by the loop condition (`4` to `n`).

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`.
   - To make the loop execute again, `j` needs to be set to `4` (the start of the range).

### Conclusion:
- `j` must be set to `4` for the loop to execute one more time.
- `n` remains the same as it was before.

### Final State:
State: **`j` is 4, `n` is the same as before**
