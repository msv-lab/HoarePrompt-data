Based on the initial state provided, the code snippet is:

```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Here, `j` is a variable whose value is not explicitly stated in the initial state. Since no specific value for `j` is given, we cannot determine the exact printed output. However, we can describe what will be printed in terms of the value of `j`.

Output: **str(j) + ' ' + str(j)** (where `j` is the value of the variable `j`)
