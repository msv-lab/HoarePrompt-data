Output State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 9, `j` is 9.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 4` to `j = n`. After 3 iterations, `j` is 5. Therefore, to complete all iterations, `n` must be at least 9 (since the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration). The final value of `j` will be `n`, which means `j` will be 9 when the loop finishes.
