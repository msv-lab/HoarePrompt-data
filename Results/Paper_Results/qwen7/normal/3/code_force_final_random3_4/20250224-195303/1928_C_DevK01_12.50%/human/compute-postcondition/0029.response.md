Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `int(w // 1)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `w` is the integer part of the square root of `q` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - `q` is divisible by `i`.
   - `M` is a list containing the elements 1, `q // i`, and `i` with `q // i` greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, if `i` is currently 2, then for the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `int(w // 1)`.
   - We need to ensure that `int(w // 1)` is greater than 3 (since `i` will be 3 in the next iteration).

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `w` remains the same since it is derived from `q` and does not change within the loop.
   - `q` remains the same since it is derived from `M` and does not change within the loop.
   - `M` remains the same since it is constructed outside the loop and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `w` is the integer part of the square root of `q` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `q` is divisible by `i`, and `M` is a list containing the elements 1, `q // i`, and `i` with `q // i` greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
