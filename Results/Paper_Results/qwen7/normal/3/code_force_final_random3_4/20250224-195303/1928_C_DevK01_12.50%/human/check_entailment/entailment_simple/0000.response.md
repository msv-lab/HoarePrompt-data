Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of possible values for \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) can be achieved following the described settling pattern. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the sequence of numbers assigned to positions follows a specific rule.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern can be understood as repeating every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must satisfy certain conditions derived from the pattern.
   - The function `func_1` is used to find all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function calculates all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It uses the square root of \( q \) to efficiently find these divisors.
   - The logic is correct and ensures that all necessary divisors are included in the list `M`.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with appropriate parameters.
   - The results are processed correctly, ensuring that the final output matches the expected number of possible \( k \) values.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) are handled appropriately.
   - The logic for handling the special case when \( y \) is odd is correctly implemented.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. All logical steps and conditions are properly handled, and the function `func_1` is correctly used to find the required divisors.

Correctness: **True**
