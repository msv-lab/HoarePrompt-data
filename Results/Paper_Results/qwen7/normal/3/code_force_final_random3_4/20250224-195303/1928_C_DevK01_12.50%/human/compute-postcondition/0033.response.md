Output State: **`i` is 3, `w` is the integer part of the square root of `q` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `q` is divisible by `i`, `M` is a list containing the elements 1, `q // i`, `i`, `i`, and an additional `q // i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `M += [q // i]` appends the value of `q // i` to the list `M`. Since `M` initially contains the elements 1, `q // i`, `i`, and `i`, after executing the code, `M` will contain these elements plus an additional `q // i`. The values of `i`, `w`, `q`, and the condition checks remain unchanged.
