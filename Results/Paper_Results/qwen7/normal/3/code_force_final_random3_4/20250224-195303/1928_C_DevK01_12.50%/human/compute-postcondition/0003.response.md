Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q); `M` is a list containing the value of `w`, `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

The code `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. Since `w` is defined as the square root of `q` and is an integer, it is added to the list `M`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
