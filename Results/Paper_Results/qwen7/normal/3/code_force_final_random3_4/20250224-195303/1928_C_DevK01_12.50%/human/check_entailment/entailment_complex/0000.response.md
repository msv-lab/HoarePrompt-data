Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya can be accommodated within the settling pattern described. The key is to find all \( k \) such that the settling pattern matches the given \( n \) and \( x \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must fit into one of the segments of the settling pattern.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). These divisors represent potential values of \( k \) that could fit the given conditions.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies all divisors of \( q \) that meet the criteria.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly processes each test case by splitting the input into \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even. If not, it prints 0 and continues.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \) to get potential values of \( k \).
   - It also checks if \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) and calls `func_1` again with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \) to account for additional segments.
   - The results are stored in a set to avoid duplicates and the length of the set is printed as the final result.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The solution handles the constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) and \( 1 \leq x < q \) appropriately.
   - The logic for checking the divisors and ensuring they meet the criteria is sound.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
