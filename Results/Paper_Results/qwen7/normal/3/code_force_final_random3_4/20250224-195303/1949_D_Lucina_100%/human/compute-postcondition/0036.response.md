Output State: All elements in arrays `a` and `b` will be incremented based on the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in the string `x`. Specifically, for every 'F' encountered at index `j-1` in `x`, the corresponding `a[i]` and `a[j]` will be incremented by 1. For every 'S' encountered, `b[i]` and `b[j]` will be incremented by 1. If any character in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', it will not affect the values of `a` or `b`.

In summary, after the loop completes all its iterations, `a[i]` will be the sum of all positions `j` where `x[j-1]` is 'F', and `a[j]` (for all `j` from 1 to `n`) will also reflect these counts. Similarly, `b[i]` will be the sum of all positions `j` where `x[j-1]` is 'S', and `b[j]` will reflect these counts as well.
