Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n + 1`; `nx` is an empty string
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'F'
    else:
        nx += 'S'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `nx` is a string, `n` must be at least 1, and the condition `xx[i][j - 1]` is either not equal to '?' with `nx` being the sum of its previous value and the element at index `[i][j - 1]` of `xx`, or equal to '?' with `nx` being the string 'F' appended to its previous value if either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `nx` is a string, and either the character `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', in which case `nx` is the original string plus the character `xx[i][j - 1]`, or `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` (excluding the last element) or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (excluding the last element). In the latter case, `nx` is 'F' followed by the original string value of `nx`. If neither condition is met, `nx` is 'S' followed by the original string value of `nx`, and `n` must be at least 1, and `j` is `j + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `nx` is a string. If the character `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the original string plus the character `xx[i][j-1]`, and `n` must be at least 1, with `j` incremented by 1. If `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` (excluding the last element) or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (excluding the last element), then `nx` is the original string plus 'F', and `n` must be at least 1, with `j` incremented by 1. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S' followed by the original string value of `nx`, and `j` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
