Postcondition: `nx` is a string, `n` must be at least 1, and the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'. If `nx` was previously a string, it remains unchanged. If `nx` was an integer, it is updated to the sum of its previous value and the element at index `[i][j - 1]` of `xx`. Additionally, if either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is the string 'F' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.
