Output State: **`nx` is a string with the last character of `xx[i][n]` appended to it, `j` is `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code appends the character at index `j - 1` of the list `xx[i]` to the string `nx`. Given that `j` is defined as `n + 2`, the index being accessed is `n + 1`. Therefore, `nx` now includes the character from `xx[i][n + 1]`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
