Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to `i_end + 2`, and `j` is equal to `n`. The condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` holds true. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `n` will still hold its original value (which must be greater than 0), and `i` will be set to `i_end + 2`. The loop variable `j` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from 1 to `n` inclusive. The condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` must still be true, meaning the last character checked in the string `x` is not 'F'. If the last character is 'F', then `a[j]` will be incremented by 1; if it is 'S', then `b[j]` will be incremented by 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from their initial or previous postconditions.
