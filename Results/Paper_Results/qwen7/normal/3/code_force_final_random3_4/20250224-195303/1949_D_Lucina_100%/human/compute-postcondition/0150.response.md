Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 24\).
   - `sa` is a list containing 1 and 3.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive), so the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 4, `n` must be greater than 4.

5. **Consider the postcondition**: The postcondition does not affect the loop itself but might affect the state inside the loop. However, since we are only adjusting the state for the loop to execute one more time, we do not need to consider the postcondition here.

6. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.
   - `sa` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop head variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `sa` is a list containing 1 and 3**.
