The function processes a 2D grid of size n x n, where each cell contains either 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?', or '.'. It counts the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in each row and stores these counts in lists `a` and `b`. Based on these counts, it decides the type of transition video ('F' or 'S') for the undecided cells ('?'). If more rows have 'F' counts greater than zero compared to 'S' counts, it sets all undecided cells to 'F'; otherwise, it sets them to 'S'. Finally, it prints the completed grid.
