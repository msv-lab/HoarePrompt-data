Output State: **`i` is 2, `sb` is a list containing the integer 1, `a` is a list of integers with the value of `a[1]` being 0 and the rest unchanged, `b` is a list of integers with the value of `b[1]` being 0 and the rest unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `sb`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1 according to the typical behavior of such operations in loops or sequential processing, making `i` equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged as no other operations were performed on them.
