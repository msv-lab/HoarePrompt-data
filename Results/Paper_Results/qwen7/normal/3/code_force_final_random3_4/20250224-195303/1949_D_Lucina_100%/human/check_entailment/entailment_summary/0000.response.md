Reasoning:
1. The problem requires ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type occur for any permutation of the scenarios.
2. The provided program attempts to count the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions in each row and then decide the type for undecided cells ('?').
3. However, the logic in the program is flawed:
   - It incorrectly assumes that setting all undecided cells to 'F' or 'S' based on the majority of 'F' or 'S' counts in the first \(\frac{n}{4} - 1\) rows will always satisfy the condition.
   - This approach does not guarantee that the constraint will hold for all permutations of the scenarios.
4. The program does not consider the global impact of the decisions made on the entire sequence of transition videos for any permutation of the scenarios.
5. The program also does not handle cases where the counts of 'F' and 'S' are equal or nearly equal, which would require a more sophisticated balancing strategy.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
