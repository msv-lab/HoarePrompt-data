Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `b[i]` is increased by 1**

The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the exact value of `b` or `i`, so we only know that `b[i]` has been increased by 1. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
