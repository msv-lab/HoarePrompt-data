### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Step 1: Input Parsing
The program reads an integer `n` and a matrix representing the current state of the transition videos. This part is correct and works as expected.

#### Step 2: Counting Funny and Scary Videos
The program counts the number of funny (`F`) and scary (`S`) videos for each scenario. This is done using two arrays `a` and `b`, where `a[i]` and `b[i]` represent the count of funny and scary videos involving scenario `i`, respectively. This step is also correct.

#### Step 3: Identifying Decided and Undecided Videos
The program identifies scenarios where the type of transition video is already decided (`F` or `S`) and those that are still undecided (`?`). This is done by checking the values in the matrix and populating the `sa` and `sb` lists accordingly. This step is correct.

#### Step 4: Handling the Decision Logic
The main logic of the program is in this section:
- If the number of undecided scenarios (`len(sa)`) is greater than or equal to the number of decided scary scenarios (`len(sb)`), it assigns funny videos to the undecided scenarios.
- Otherwise, it assigns scary videos to the undecided scenarios.

However, there are several issues with this logic:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Undecided Scenarios**: The program attempts to assign funny or scary videos to the undecided scenarios based on the size of `sa` and `sb`. However, this approach does not ensure that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is met.
2. **Incorrect Assignment Logic**: The assignment logic inside the nested loops is flawed. It tries to assign `F` or `S` to undecided scenarios based on whether they are in the first \(\frac{n}{4} - 1\) positions of `sa` or `sb`. This does not guarantee the required constraint.
3. **Output Formatting**: The output formatting is incorrect. The program should output a string of length `n` for each scenario, but instead, it outputs a string of length `n+1`.

#### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are seen in any permutation of scenarios. The logic for assigning funny or scary videos to undecided scenarios is flawed and does not meet the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**False**
