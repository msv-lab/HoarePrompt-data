Postcondition: `nx` is either 'F' appended to its previous value if either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, or 'S' if neither `i` nor `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`. `n` must be at least 1, and the condition `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?' remains unchanged.
