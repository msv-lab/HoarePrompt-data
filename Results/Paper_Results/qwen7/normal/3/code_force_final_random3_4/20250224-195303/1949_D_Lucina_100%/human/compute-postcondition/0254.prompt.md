Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The final state of `sa` will contain all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The final value of `nx` is determined by the concatenation of characters from `xx[i][j-1]` for all iterations of the loop, unless `xx[i][j-1]` is '?'. If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', `nx` will be 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, otherwise `nx` will be 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nx` is a string that has been constructed based on the conditions inside the loop for all iterations from 1 to n.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: nx is a string that may contain any combination of 'F', 'S', and characters from `xx[i]` up to `xx[i][n]`, depending on the conditions within the loop. `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the final value of `nx` is determined by the characters in `xx[i]` and the conditions specified in the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
