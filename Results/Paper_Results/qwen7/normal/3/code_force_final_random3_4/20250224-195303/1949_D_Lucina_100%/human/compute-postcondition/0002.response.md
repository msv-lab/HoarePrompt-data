Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and `a` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros; `b` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros.**

The code initializes a new list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `0`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `b` will also be a list of length between 3 and 25, inclusive, filled with zeros. The list `a` remains unchanged from its initial state.
