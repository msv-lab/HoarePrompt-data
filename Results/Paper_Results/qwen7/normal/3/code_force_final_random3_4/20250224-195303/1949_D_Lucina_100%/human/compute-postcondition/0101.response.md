Output State: **`b[i]` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to `i_end + 2`, `j` is `j_end + 2`, and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` still holds true.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, and the condition involving `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
