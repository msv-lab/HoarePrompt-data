Output State: **`a[i]` and `a[j_prev + 1]` are integers; `b[i]` is increased by 1; `b[j_prev + 1]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged if `x[j_prev]` is neither 'F' nor 'S'; otherwise, `b[j_prev + 1]` is increased by 1 if `x[j_prev]` equals 'S'.**

This means that `b[i]` has been incremented by 1. The values of `a[i]` and `a[j_prev + 1]` remain unchanged unless `x[j_prev]` equals 'F', in which case they would also be incremented by 1. If `x[j_prev]` equals 'S', then `b[j_prev + 1]` is also incremented by 1. The condition for `n` being greater than or equal to `j_prev + 1` remains valid.
