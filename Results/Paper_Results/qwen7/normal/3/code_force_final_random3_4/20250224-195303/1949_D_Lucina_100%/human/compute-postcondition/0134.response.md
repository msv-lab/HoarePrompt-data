Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), `a` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `b` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `xx` is a list containing all the strings `x` entered during the iterations of the loop, `j` is equal to `n`, `sa` is a list containing `1`, `3`, and possibly `4`; `sb` is a list containing the element `1`, `3`, and `i`. If `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, then `sa` includes `4` and `sb` includes `i`. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged.
