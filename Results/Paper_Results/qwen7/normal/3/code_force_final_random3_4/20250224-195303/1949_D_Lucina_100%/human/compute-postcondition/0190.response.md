Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Loop Head Variables**:
   - `i` is given as `n + 1`.
   - `nx` is an empty string.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

4. **Analyze the Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `n` must be at least 1 (since the range starts from 1).
   - When the loop starts, `j` will be set to 1 initially.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` is set to 1 initially, we need to ensure `n` is at least 1.
   - The variable `i` is not used within the loop, so its initial value (`n + 1`) does not affect the loop's execution.
   - The variable `nx` is not used within the loop, so its initial value (empty string) does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be at least 1**
