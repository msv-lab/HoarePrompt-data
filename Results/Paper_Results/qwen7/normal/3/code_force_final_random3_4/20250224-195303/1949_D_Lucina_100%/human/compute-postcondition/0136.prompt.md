Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1 where each element represents the total count of 'F' characters in the strings `x` from each iteration of the loop; `b` is a list of length n+1 where each element represents the total count of 'S' characters in the strings `x` from each iteration of the loop; `xx` is a list containing all the strings `x` entered during the iterations of the loop; `i` is set to `n+1`; `j` is equal to `n`; `sa` is an empty list; `sb` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)
    if b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1; `b` is a list of length n+1; `xx` is a list containing all the strings `x` entered during the iterations of the loop; `j` is equal to `n`; `sa` is a list containing the element `1`; `sb` is a list containing the element `i`. If `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, then `a[i]` remains 0 and `b[i]` becomes 0. Otherwise, `a[i]` remains greater than 0 and `b[i]` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length n+1, `b` is a list of length n+1, `xx` is a list containing all the strings `x` entered during the iterations of the loop, `j` is equal to `n`, `sa` is a list containing the elements `1` and possibly `3`, `sb` is a list containing the element `1` and `i`. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] > 0`, then `i` is added to `sb`; otherwise, `sb` remains as `[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), `a` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `b` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `xx` is a list containing all the strings `x` entered during the iterations of the loop, `j` is equal to `n`, `sa` is a list containing `1`, `3`, and possibly `4`; `sb` is a list containing the element `1`, `3`, and `i` if `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. Otherwise, `sb` remains as a list containing the elements `1` and `3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
