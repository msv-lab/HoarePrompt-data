Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j`. The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that:
   - If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', then `nx` remains unchanged (or retains its previous value).
   - If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', then:
     - If neither `i` nor `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` gets an additional 'S' appended to it.
     - Otherwise, `nx` becomes 'F'.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The loop variable `j` starts from `1` and increases by `1` each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`.
   - Since the loop variable `j` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to adjust its value.
   - The value of `nx` might change based on the condition inside the loop, but since we are only asked to adjust the state at the start of the next iteration, we focus on `j`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value `k` (where `1 <= k < n`).
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `j`.

**State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `nx` is a string. If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', then `nx` is equal to the previous value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j-1]`. If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', then `nx` is a string with an additional character 'S' appended to it if neither `i` nor `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'. `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.**
