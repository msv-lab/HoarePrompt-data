Output State: **`j` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`; `nx` is the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, `nx` now holds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
