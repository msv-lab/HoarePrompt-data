Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `sb` is a list containing the integers 1 and 3
   - `a` is a list of integers where `a[1]` is 0 and the rest remain unchanged
   - `b` is a list of integers where `b[1]` is 0 and the rest remain unchanged
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 4.
   - The value of `n` must still satisfy the condition `n >= 3`.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `i` is 4
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 (since `i` needs to be less than `n + 1`)

So, the updated state is:
State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
