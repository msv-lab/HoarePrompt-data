Postcondition: `xx` is a 2D list, `nx` is either 'F' or a string with 'S' appended, and `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration. Specifically, if `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is a string with 'S' appended to it.
