Output State: **`nx` is the original string plus 'F', `n` must be at least 1, and `j` is `j + 1`**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. The conditions related to `i`, `j`, and `sa` do not affect this operation since they are not referenced in the given code. The preconditions that `n` must be at least 1 and `j` is `j + 1` remain valid after the code execution.
