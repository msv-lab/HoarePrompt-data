Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, after executing the code, `n` retains this property and is also set to the integer value entered by the user. All other variables remain unchanged.
