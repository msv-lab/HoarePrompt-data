Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `xx` is a 2D list.
   - `i` is the same as before.
   - `j` is `j + 1` (meaning `j` was `j - 1` in the previous iteration).
   - `nx` is a string that is either concatenated with the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if it is not '?', or appended with 'S' or 'F' based on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 each time, in the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1` (or `j - 1 + 1 = j`).
   - Therefore, `j` will be `j` in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `xx` remains the same.
   - `i` remains the same.
   - `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `nx` will be updated based on the value of `xx[i][j]` (which was `xx[i][j - 1]` in the previous iteration).

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is a string that is either concatenated with the value of `xx[i][j]` if it is not '?', or appended with 'S' or 'F' based on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`**.
