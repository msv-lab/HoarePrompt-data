Output State: **`nx` is `nx` plus `xx[i][j - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Since the initial value of `nx` is not specified, we represent it as `nx`. The value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is taken from the nested list `xx` at the specified index. The other variables remain unchanged.
