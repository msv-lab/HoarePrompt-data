Output State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F' plus `xx[i][2]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3**.

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[i][j-1]` to it. Since `j` is 3, `xx[i][j-1]` translates to `xx[i][2]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, while `n` and `j` remain unchanged. The initial state of `nx` being either 'S' or 'F' remains valid, just updated by the addition of `xx[i][2]`.
