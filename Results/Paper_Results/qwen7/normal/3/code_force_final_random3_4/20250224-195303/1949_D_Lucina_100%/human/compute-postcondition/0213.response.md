Output State: **`nx` is the original string plus the character `xx[i][j-1]`, `n` must be at least 1, and `j` is `j + 1`**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. The conditions related to `i` and `j` being in the first quarter of `sa` or the character `xx[i][j]` not being `?` are not relevant to this specific line of code. The other variables `n` and `j` are updated as part of the conditions mentioned in the initial state, specifically `n` must be at least 1 and `j` is incremented by 1.
