Output State: **`ppp` is 23, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `l` and `r`. The values of `ppp`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial state. The output state includes the updated values of `l` and `r` based on the input, while keeping the other variables in their original state.
