Output State: **`ppp` is 23, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and `eli` is the index where the tuple (l, 0, 0) would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted.**

Explanation: The code `eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` inserts the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` into the list `arr` at the position where it maintains the sorted order of `arr`. The function `bisect_left` returns the index `eli` where this insertion should occur. The values of `ppp`, `l`, `r`, and `tc` remain unchanged from their initial state.
