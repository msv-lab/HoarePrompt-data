Based on the initial state provided:

- `ppp` is explicitly given as 23.
- `l` and `r` are obtained from input split and converted to integers.
- `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the index determined by `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.

However, the `print(-1, -1)` statement does not depend on the values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `e`, or `_`. It directly prints `-1, -1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **-1, -1**
