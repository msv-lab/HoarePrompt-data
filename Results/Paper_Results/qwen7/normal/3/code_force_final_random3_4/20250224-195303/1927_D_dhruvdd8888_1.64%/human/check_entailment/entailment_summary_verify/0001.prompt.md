You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers and handles a series of queries. Initially, it constructs a list of segments where each segment contains consecutive identical elements from the input list. For each query, it determines the segment that covers the specified range `[l, r)` and outputs the start and end indices of that segment, or `-1` if no such segment exists. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N`, the array itself, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It processes the array to identify segments where the value changes.
   - Specifically, it identifies segments where the value of the array changes and stores these segments in the `arr` list.

3. **Handling Segments:**
   - The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment for each query.
   - For each query, it checks if the segment starts before the left boundary `l` and ends after the right boundary `r`.
   - If the segment starts before `l`, it prints the indices of the start and end of the previous segment.
   - If the segment ends after `r`, it prints `-1 -1`.
   - If the segment is within the boundaries, it prints the start and end of the segment.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Identifying Segments:**
   - The program correctly identifies segments where the value changes in the array.
   - However, the way it handles the segments might not always be optimal. For example, if there are multiple consecutive elements with the same value, the program will treat them as a single segment.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The program uses binary search to find the appropriate segment for each query.
   - It checks if the segment starts before the left boundary `l` and ends after the right boundary `r`.
   - This logic seems correct but needs to handle edge cases properly.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles some edge cases (like when `s == 1` and `e == N`) correctly.
   - However, it might miss some cases where the segment is exactly at the boundaries.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

```plaintext
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3

30 20 20 10 10 20

5
2 3 1 4 2
7
1 2
1 4
1 5
2 4
2 5
3 5
4 5
```

The expected output matches the provided solution. The program correctly identifies segments and handles queries as required.
