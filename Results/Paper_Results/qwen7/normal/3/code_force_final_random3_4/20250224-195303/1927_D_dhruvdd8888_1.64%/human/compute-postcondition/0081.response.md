Output State: **`ppp` is 23, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `eli` is the index where (l, 0, 0) would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from either `arr[min(eli, LA)]` or `arr[max(eli, LA)]` depending on the condition `s > l`, and we continue the loop or block.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only moves the control flow to the next iteration of the loop or block. Therefore, the values of `ppp`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, and `_` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement indicates that the current iteration of the loop or block is skipped, and the control moves to the next iteration.
