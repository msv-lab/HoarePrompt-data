Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers and handles a series of queries. Initially, it constructs a list of segments where each segment contains consecutive identical elements from the input list. For each query, it determines the segment that covers the specified range `[l, r)` and outputs the start and end indices of that segment, or `-1` if no such segment exists. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.**
