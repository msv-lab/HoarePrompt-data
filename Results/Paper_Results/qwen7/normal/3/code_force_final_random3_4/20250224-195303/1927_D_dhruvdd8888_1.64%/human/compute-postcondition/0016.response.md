Output State: **`N` is a valid integer input, `arr` now contains a new tuple `(4, i+1, nums[i+1])`, `num` is equal to `nums[i+1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple to `arr` where the first element is `1 + s`, the second element is `i` incremented by 1, and the third element is `num` which is `nums[i]` where `i` was previously incremented by 1. Since `s` is not defined in the initial state, we assume `s` is a variable that needs to be defined elsewhere. However, the structure of the tuple and the relationship between the variables remain as described.
