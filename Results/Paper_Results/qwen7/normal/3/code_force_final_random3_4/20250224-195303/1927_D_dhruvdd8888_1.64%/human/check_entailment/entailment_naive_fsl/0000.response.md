Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where all elements in the queried subarray are the same. In such cases, the program should output `-1 -1`, but it does not always do so.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the program's output is:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

This is correct for the first and third queries, but for the second query (`1 2`), the program incorrectly outputs `2 3` instead of `-1 -1`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that if all elements in the queried subarray are the same, the program outputs `-1 -1`. We can achieve this by checking if the subarray has more than one distinct element before proceeding to find indices `i` and `j`.
