Output State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i]`, `i` is equal to `s + 1`, `s` is equal to `i`, and `arr` contains a new tuple `(2 + s, i, num)`**.

Explanation: The code `s = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `s`. Since `i` was previously `s + 1` or `s` (depending on the condition), after the assignment, `s` now equals `i`. The value of `num` remains unchanged, and `i` is updated to `s + 1` due to the condition. Therefore, `arr` now contains the tuple `(1 + s, i, num)`, which simplifies to `(2 + s, i, num)` since `s` is now equal to `i`.
