You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

    #State: Output State: `arr` will contain tuples representing the start and end indices along with the value of `num` for each segment of consecutive identical elements in the list `nums`. Specifically, `arr` will include a tuple for every change in the value of `num` within the list `nums`, starting from the index `s` up to `N`.
    #
    #In more detail, `arr` will be a list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(start_index, end_index, value)`, indicating that the value `value` was encountered in the list `nums` from index `start_index` to `end_index - 1`. The loop iterates through the entire list `nums` (from index 0 to `N`), and whenever it encounters a different value than the current `num`, it appends a new tuple to `arr` with the current start index (`s`), the current index (`i`), and the value of `num` before the change. After appending, it updates `s` to the current index `i` and sets `num` to the new value found at index `i`. This process continues until the loop completes all iterations over `nums`.

    #State: Postcondition: `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form (start_index, end_index, value), indicating segments of consecutive identical elements in the list `nums`. The last element in `arr` is updated to reflect the end of the last segment, and `LA` is set to the length of `arr` minus one. The current value of `ppp` is 23.

    #State: The loop will run until the user inputs a number greater than 5 for `tc`. Since the initial value of `ppp` is 23 and it is not modified within the loop, `ppp` will remain 23 after all iterations. The values of `l` and `r` will be the last pair of integers entered by the user during the loop. The variables `eli`, `s`, `e`, and `_` will be determined based on the last iteration's conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers and handles a series of queries. Initially, it constructs a list of segments where each segment contains consecutive identical elements from the input list. For each query, it determines the segment that covers the specified range `[l, r)` and outputs the start and end indices of that segment, or `-1` if no such segment exists. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where all elements in the queried subarray are the same. In such cases, the program should output `-1 -1`, but it does not always do so.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the program's output is:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

This is correct for the first and third queries, but for the second query (`1 2`), the program incorrectly outputs `2 3` instead of `-1 -1`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that if all elements in the queried subarray are the same, the program outputs `-1 -1`. We can achieve this by checking if the subarray has more than one distinct element before proceeding to find indices `i` and `j`.
