Postcondition: `ppp` is 23, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to a tuple using map and int functions, `eli` is the index where (l, 0, 0) would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from `arr[min(eli, LA)]`, and whether the current value of `s` is equal to 1 or not, the values of `s`, `e`, and `_` remain unchanged.
