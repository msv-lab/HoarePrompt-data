Output State: `arr` will contain tuples representing the start and end indices along with the value of `num` for each segment of consecutive identical elements in the list `nums`. Specifically, `arr` will include a tuple for every change in the value of `num` within the list `nums`, starting from the index `s` up to `N`.

In more detail, `arr` will be a list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(start_index, end_index, value)`, indicating that the value `value` was encountered in the list `nums` from index `start_index` to `end_index - 1`. The loop iterates through the entire list `nums` (from index 0 to `N`), and whenever it encounters a different value than the current `num`, it appends a new tuple to `arr` with the current start index (`s`), the current index (`i`), and the value of `num` before the change. After appending, it updates `s` to the current index `i` and sets `num` to the new value found at index `i`. This process continues until the loop completes all iterations over `nums`.
