Output State: **`arr` now contains a new tuple `(2 + s, i, num)`, `s` is equal to `i`, `N` is a valid integer input, the current value of `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `s = i` assigns the value of `i` to `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the tuple in `arr` is updated to `(2 + s, i, num)`, which simplifies to `(2 + i, i, num)` since `s` is now `i`. The other conditions and values remain as they were initially.
