Postcondition: `ppp` is 23, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to a tuple using map and int functions, `eli` is the index where (l, 0, 0) would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from `arr[min(eli, len(arr)-1)]`, and if `e` is less than `N`, the condition remains unchanged. If `e` is greater than or equal to `N`, the condition also remains unchanged.
