Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form (start_index, end_index, value), indicating segments of consecutive identical elements in the list `nums`. The last element in `arr` is updated to reflect the end of the last segment, and `LA` is set to the length of `arr` minus one. The current value of `ppp` is 23.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if tc > 5:
        if ppp == 23:
            print(l, r)
        continue
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ppp` is 23, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to a tuple using map and int functions, `eli` is the index where (l, 0, 0) would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from either `arr[min(eli, LA)]` or `arr[max(eli, LA)]` depending on the condition `s > l`. If `e` is less than `N`, the condition remains unchanged. If `e` is greater than or equal to `N`, the condition also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ppp` is 23, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `eli` is the index where (l, 0, 0) would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from either `arr[min(eli, LA)]` or `arr[max(eli, LA)]` depending on the condition `s > l`. This assignment is done regardless of whether `s == 1` or `e >= r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ppp` is 23, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the index determined by `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`, regardless of the comparison between `s` and `l` or the comparison between `e` and `r`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
