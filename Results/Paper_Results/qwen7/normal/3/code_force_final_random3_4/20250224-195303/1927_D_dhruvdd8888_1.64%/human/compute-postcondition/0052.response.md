Based on the initial state provided:

- `ppp` is explicitly given as 23.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to a tuple using `map` and `int` functions. However, the actual values of `l` and `r` are not provided in the initial state.
- `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted. This value is not provided.
- `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from `arr[min(eli, LA)]`. Here, `LA` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `s`, `e`, and `_`.
- The current value of `s` is explicitly given as 1.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement will directly print the values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
