Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ppp` is explicitly given as 23.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to a tuple using `map` and `int` functions. However, the specific input is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of `l` and `r`.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted. This means `eli` is determined by the position where `(l, 0, 0)` fits into the sorted order of `arr`.
   - `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from `arr[min(eli, len(arr)-1)]`. This means `s`, `e`, and `_` are all set to the same value from the list `arr` at the index `min(eli, len(arr)-1)`.
   - `e` is less than `N`, but `N` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `e`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(s, e + 1)
   ```

Given the information, we know:
- `s` and `e` are the same value from `arr` at the index `min(eli, len(arr)-1)`.
- `e + 1` will be the next integer after `e`.

Since we do not have the exact values of `l`, `r`, `arr`, `eli`, and `N`, we can only express the output in terms of the known parts.

Output: **s s + 1 (where s is the value from arr at min(eli, len(arr)-1))**
