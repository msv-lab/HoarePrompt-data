Output State: **`ans` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is equal to `int(input())`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` remains the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers created from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list `a`. This changes the value of `a` but does not affect the other variables mentioned (`ans`, `i`, `tmp`, and `cnt`). The other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
