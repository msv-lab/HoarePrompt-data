Postcondition: `ans` is the minimum of its current value (which is `n`) and `cnt`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `a[i]` equals `tmp`, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `t` is `t - 1`, and `a[i]` is either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp`.
