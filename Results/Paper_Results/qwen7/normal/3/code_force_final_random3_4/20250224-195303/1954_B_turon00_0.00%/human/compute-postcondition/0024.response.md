Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. This changes the value of `cnt`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.
