Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the specified range, and `n` remains an input integer. The newly created list `a` contains the integers from the input.
