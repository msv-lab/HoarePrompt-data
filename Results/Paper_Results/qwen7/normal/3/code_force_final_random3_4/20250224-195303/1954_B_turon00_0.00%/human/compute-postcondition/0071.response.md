Output State: **`ans` is the minimum value between its initial value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t - 1`**.

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().strip().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The other variables (`ans`, `cnt`, `tmp`, `aa`, `n`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
