Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`, and all elements in the list `a` are the same.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. Since the if-else block is not provided, no changes are made to `cnt`, and the conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged. The set `aa` still contains exactly one unique element because the condition that all elements in the list `a` are the same is maintained.
