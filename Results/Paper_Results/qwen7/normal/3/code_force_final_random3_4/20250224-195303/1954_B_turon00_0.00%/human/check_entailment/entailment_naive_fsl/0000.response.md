Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the correct elements. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Array Removal Logic**: The program attempts to count the consecutive occurrences of the first element (`tmp`) and then finds the minimum count among these segments. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of removing elements in a way that breaks the beauty condition without necessarily having the longest segment of identical elements.

2. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the input: `5 1 2 1 2 1`. According to the problem, the correct answer should be `1` because removing the second element (which is `2`) makes the array `[1, 1, 2, 1]`, which is no longer beautiful.
   - The program, however, would incorrectly output `3` because it counts the maximum segment of identical elements (`1` appears three times consecutively), and it removes the minimum of these segments, which is `1`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, you need to identify the longest segment of identical elements and then calculate the number of elements that need to be removed to break the beauty condition. This involves checking the transitions between different elements and determining the minimum number of removals needed to ensure no two adjacent elements are equal.

Since the provided program does not handle the problem correctly for certain cases, the correctness is **False**.
