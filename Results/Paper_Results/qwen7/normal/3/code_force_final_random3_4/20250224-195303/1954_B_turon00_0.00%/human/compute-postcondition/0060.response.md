Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`
   - If `a[i]` equals `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.
   - The value of `ans` is dependent on the previous `ans` and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition `a[i] == tmp`, `ans` will remain the same as it was in the previous iteration because `i` is now 2 and the condition hasn't been checked yet.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt` (unchanged)

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`**.
