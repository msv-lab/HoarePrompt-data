Postcondition: `ans` is the minimum of its current value (which is `n`), and either `cnt + 1` if `a[i] == tmp`, or 0 if `a[i] != tmp`. `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is either 2 or 1, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `a[i]` is either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp`.
