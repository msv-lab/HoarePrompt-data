Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an index within the list `a` that is 1 more than the previous value of `i`.
   - `tmp` is an integer.
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0.
   - `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `tmp` remains unchanged.
- `cnt` remains unchanged.
- `ans` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list that is 1 more than the previous value of `i`, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`**.

However, to provide a concrete example, if the previous value of `i` was 3, then the new value of `i` will be 4. Thus, the state can be specifically stated as:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is 4, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index 4 in list `a` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`**.
