Output State: **`r` is the new value of `a[x]` added to its previous value plus `a[x]`, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the string `b`, and `b[x]` is incremented by 1. `x` is now updated to the index of `i` in the string `b`.**

Explanation: The code `r += a[x]` increments `r` by the value of `a[x]`. The value of `i` and `x` remain unchanged, and `b[x]` is incremented by 1, with `x` being updated to the new index of `i` in the string `b`.
