Output State: **`r` is `r + a[x] + 1 + a[x]`, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `b[x]` is `b[x] + 1`, `i` is the next element in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `r += a[x]` increments `r` by the value of `a[x]`. Since `x` is already the index of `i` in `b`, the value of `a[x]` is added to `r`. The previous state of `r` was `r + a[x] + 1`, so after the increment, `r` becomes `r + a[x] + 1 + a[x]`. The other variables (`x`, `b[x]`, `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
