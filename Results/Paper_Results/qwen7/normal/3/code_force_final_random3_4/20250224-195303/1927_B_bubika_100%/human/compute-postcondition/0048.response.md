Output State: **`r` is increased by `a[x]`, `s` must contain at least one element, `b[x]` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `b[x] += 1` increments the value of `b[x]` by 1. The other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `r` is still increased by `a[x]`, `s` must contain at least one element, and `b[x]` is now increased by 1 compared to its previous value.
