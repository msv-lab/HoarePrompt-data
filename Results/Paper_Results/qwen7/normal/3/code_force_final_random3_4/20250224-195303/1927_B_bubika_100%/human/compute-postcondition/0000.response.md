Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n; a is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.

The variable `a` was originally a list, but it has been reassigned to the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
