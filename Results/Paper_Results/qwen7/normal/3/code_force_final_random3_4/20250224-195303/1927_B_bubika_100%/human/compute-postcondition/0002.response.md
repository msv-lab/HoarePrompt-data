Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `b` is a list of 26 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `b` with 26 elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the value of `t`. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, and `b` becomes a list containing 26 zeros.
