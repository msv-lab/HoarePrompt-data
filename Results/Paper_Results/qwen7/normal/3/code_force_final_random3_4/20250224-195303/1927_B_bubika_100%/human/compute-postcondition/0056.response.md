Output State: **`r` is now `2 * a[x]`, `s` must contain at least one element, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is the index of `i` in list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `r += a[x]` adds the value of `a[x]` to `r`. Since initially `r` was set to `r + a[x]`, adding `a[x]` again doubles its value, making `r` now `2 * a[x]`. The other variables (`s`, `b[x]`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
