Output State: **`r` is `a[x]` added to its previous value, `i` is the first character of the string `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the string `b`.**

Explanation: The code `r += a[x]` adds the value of `a[x]` to the current value of `r`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
