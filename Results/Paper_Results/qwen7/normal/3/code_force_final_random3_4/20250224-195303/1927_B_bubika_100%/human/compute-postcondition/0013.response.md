Output State: **`r` is increased by `a[x]`, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, and `r` is now `r + a[x]`.**

This means that the value of `r` has been updated to its previous value plus `a[x]`, where `x` is the index of `i` in `b`. The values of `x` and `b[x]` have also been updated according to their previous definitions.
