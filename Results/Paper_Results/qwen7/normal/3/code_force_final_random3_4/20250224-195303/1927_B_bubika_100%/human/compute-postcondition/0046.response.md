Output State: **`s` must contain at least one element; `x` is the index of `i` in list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `x = b.index(i)` finds the index of the element `i` in the list `b` and assigns it to the variable `x`. Since `s` must contain at least one element, its state remains unchanged. The value of `x` is now the index of `i` in the list `b`.
