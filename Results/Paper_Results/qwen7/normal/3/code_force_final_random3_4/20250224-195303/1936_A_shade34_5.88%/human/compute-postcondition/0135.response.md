Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive. `i` is either in the list `pans` or added to it (if `s == '<'`), and `pans` contains either `[i]` or `[i+1]` (if `s == '<'`) or the element `n` (if `s != '<'`). `s` is assigned the value of the input string, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.
