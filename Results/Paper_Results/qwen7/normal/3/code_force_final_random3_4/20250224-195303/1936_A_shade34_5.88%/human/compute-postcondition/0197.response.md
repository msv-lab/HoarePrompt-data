Output State: **`mak` is `len(pans) + n - 1`, `mak2` is `len(pans) + n - 1`, `i` is `n`, `pans` is an empty list, `s` contains the final input string received, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, and `len(pans)` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `pans` as an empty list. This changes the value of `pans` from its previous state (which was `len(pans) + n - 1`) to an empty list. All other variables (`mak`, `mak2`, `i`, `s`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
