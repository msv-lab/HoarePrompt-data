Output State: **`mak` is either 1, 2, or 3; `i` is equal to the length of `pans` after the next iteration; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `mak` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the initial states of `mak` and `i`.
