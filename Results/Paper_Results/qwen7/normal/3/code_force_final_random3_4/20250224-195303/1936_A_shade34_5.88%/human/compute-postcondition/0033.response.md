Output State: **`mak` is equal to `i`, `s` is '<', `pans` is `[i]`**.

Explanation: The variable `pans` is initialized as a list containing the value of `i`. The values of `mak` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call is used to ensure that any buffered output is written to the console immediately, but since no direct output is generated by this line, it does not affect the variables.
