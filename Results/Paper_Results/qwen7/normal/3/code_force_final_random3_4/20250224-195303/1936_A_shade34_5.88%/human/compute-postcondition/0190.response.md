Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is defined as `len(pans) + 1`
- `mak2` is defined as `n - 1`
- `i` is defined as `len(pans) + 2`
- `pans` is a list containing indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`
- `s` is a string containing the final input received
- `n` is an integer that must be at least 2
- `len(pans)` is less than `n`

We need to determine the values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` based on the length of the `pans` list.

Let's break it down:

1. `mak = len(pans) + 1`: This means `mak` is one more than the number of elements in the `pans` list.
2. `mak2 = n - 1`: This means `mak2` is `n` minus 1.
3. `i = len(pans) + 2`: This means `i` is two more than the number of elements in the `pans` list.

Since `len(pans)` is less than `n`, let's denote `len(pans)` as `k` where `k < n`.

So, we have:
- `mak = k + 1`
- `mak2 = n - 1`
- `i = k + 2`

Given these values, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? [k+1] [k+1] [k+2] [k+2]** (where `k` is the length of the `pans` list).
