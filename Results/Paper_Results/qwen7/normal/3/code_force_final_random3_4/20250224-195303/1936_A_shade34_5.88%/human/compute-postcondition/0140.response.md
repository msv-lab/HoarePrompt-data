Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is equal to `i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `pans` contains either `[i]` or `[i+1]` (if `s == '<'`) or the element `n` (if `s != '<'`), `s` is assigned the value of the input string, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.**

Explanation: The variable `mak` is updated to be equal to `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
