Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is `n + 1`
- `mak2` is `n - 1`
- `i` is `len(pans)`
- `pans` is a list of indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`
- `s` contains the final input string received

The `print('!', mak2, mak)` statement will execute with the following values:

- `mak2` is `n - 1`
- `mak` is `n + 1`

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **! n - 1 n + 1**
