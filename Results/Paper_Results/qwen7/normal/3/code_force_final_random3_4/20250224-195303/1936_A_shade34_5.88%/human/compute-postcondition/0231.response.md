Postcondition: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is at least 2, `s` is the input string from the user, `mak` is `i`, `pans` is a list containing the value `i`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed. If the input string `s` equals `'='`, then `pans` is updated to contain the value `i` twice. Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.
