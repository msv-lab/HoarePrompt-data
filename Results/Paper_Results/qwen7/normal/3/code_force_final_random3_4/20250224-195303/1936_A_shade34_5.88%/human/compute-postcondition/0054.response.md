Output State: **`s` is a new string input from the user, `mak` is `k + 1`, `pans` is a list containing the value `i`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` is the same as before the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pans = [i]` updates the list `pans` to contain the value of `i`. Given that `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `pans` is now a list with one element, which is `k + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
