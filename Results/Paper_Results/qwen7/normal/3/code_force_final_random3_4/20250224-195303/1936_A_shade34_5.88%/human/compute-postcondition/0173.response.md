Output State: **`mak` is `n + 1`, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `i` is `len(pans)`, `pans` has all indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`, `s` contains the final input string received, no changes were made to the variables due to `sys.stdout.flush()`**.

Explanation: The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not modify any variables or their values. It only ensures that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. Therefore, the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, `pans`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
