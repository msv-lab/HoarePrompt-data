Output State: **`mak` is 0, all other variables (`pans`, `mak2`, `t`, `n`, `i`) retain their initial values.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `mak`. Since `mak2` is initially set to `3`, `t` is at least `1`, `n` is greater than `3`, and `i` starts at `n-1` and decrements with each iteration until it reaches `0`, these values remain unchanged. The variable `pans` also retains its initial state as it was not affected by the assignment.
