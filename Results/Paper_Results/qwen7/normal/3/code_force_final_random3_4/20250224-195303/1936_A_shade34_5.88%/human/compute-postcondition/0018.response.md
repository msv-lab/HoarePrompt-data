Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `mak` is 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If the input string is less than '<', otherwise the values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, and `i` remain as per the precondition.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Post-loop state**:
   - `t` must still be at least 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2.
   - `mak` remains 2.
   - `i` becomes 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `mak` is 2, `i` is 3**.
