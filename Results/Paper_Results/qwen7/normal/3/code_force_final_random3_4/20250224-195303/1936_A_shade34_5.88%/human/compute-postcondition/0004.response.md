Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1, but its exact value is not specified.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified.
- `mak` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 1.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

- The first argument is `'?'`, which is a string.
- The second and third arguments are both `mak`, which is 0.
- The fourth and fifth arguments are both `i`, which is 1.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'? 0 0 1 1'**
