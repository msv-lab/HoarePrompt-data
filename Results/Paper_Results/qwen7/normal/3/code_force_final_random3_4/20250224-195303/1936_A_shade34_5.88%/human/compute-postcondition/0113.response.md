Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `pans` is an empty list, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values but ensures that all previously written output buffers are flushed (written to the terminal). Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
