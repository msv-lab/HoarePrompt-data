Output State: **`mak` is `n + 1`, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `i` is `len(pans)`, `pans` has all indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`, `s` contains the final input string received, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`mak`, `mak2`, `i`, `pans`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
