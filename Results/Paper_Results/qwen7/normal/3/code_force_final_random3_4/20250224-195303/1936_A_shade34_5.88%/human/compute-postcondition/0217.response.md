Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `s` is the new string input by the user, `mak` is `i`, `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if the new `s` equals '<', otherwise `pans` is a list with the value `i` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` simply assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `mak`. The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, `mak`, and `pans` remain unchanged from their previous states, except that `mak` is now equal to `i`. The condition for the value of `pans` remains the same as per the initial state description.
