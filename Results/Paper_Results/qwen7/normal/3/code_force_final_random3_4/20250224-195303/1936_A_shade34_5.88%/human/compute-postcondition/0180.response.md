Postcondition: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `i` is `len(pans)`, `pans` has all indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`, `s` contains the final input string received, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, and `len(pans)` must be less than `n`. The current input is `<`, and `s` now includes this new input.**
