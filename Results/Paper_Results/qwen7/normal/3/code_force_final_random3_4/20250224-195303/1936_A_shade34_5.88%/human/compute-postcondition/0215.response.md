Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string input by the user, `mak` is `i` if `s` equals '<', otherwise `mak` is the same as before, `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if `s` equals '<', otherwise `pans` is a list with the value `i` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously printed data is actually displayed. Since no variables are modified by this command, the initial states of all variables remain unchanged.
