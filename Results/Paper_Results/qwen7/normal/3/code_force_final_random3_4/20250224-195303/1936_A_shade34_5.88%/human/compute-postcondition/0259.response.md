Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes inputs through a series of test cases where each case includes an integer t (the number of test cases) and for each test case, a permutation p (a list of integers that is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} where n is the size of the permutation). The function returns information about each permutation based on the given test cases.**
