Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string input by the user, and the current value of `s` is '<', `mak` is `i`**.

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Since `i` is `n` and `n` is at least 2, `mak` will also be `n`. The values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged.
