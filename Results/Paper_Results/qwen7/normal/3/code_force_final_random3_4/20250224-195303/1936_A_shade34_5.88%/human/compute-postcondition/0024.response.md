Output State: **Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `mak` is 3, and `i` is equal to `n-1`.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. Given that the loop has completed all its iterations, the condition `if str(input()) == '<':` would have been checked for each value of `i` from `1` to `n-1`. If the input was `<` for any `i`, `mak` would be updated to that `i`. However, based on the given outputs, it seems the input was always `'< '` (a string with a space), which means `mak` was updated to the last value of `i`, which is `n-1`. Therefore, `mak` remains `3` (the highest value `i` reached). The other variables (`t` and `n`) remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop.
