Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `i` is equal to the length of `pans`, which is `2n - 1`, `mak` is equal to `2n - 1`, and `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive. The value of `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `2n - 1`, which is the length of the list `pans`. The variable `mak` will also be equal to `2n - 1`, assuming that the input was always '>', causing `mak` to be updated to the current value of `i` in each iteration. The list `pans` remains unchanged, containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive. Additionally, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called for each iteration of the loop.
