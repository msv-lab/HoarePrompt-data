Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `i` must be at least 1, but its exact value is not specified.
- `n` must be at least 2, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Given this, the output will include the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `mak` (which is 0), and then the value of `i` (which is at least 1).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 0 0 1 1' (assuming the minimum value for `i`, which is 1)**

Note: Since `i` must be at least 1, the actual value could be any number greater than or equal to 1, but the minimum value is used here for the most precise description based on the given constraints.
