You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, based on the problem description, t (the number of test cases) is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n (the size of the permutation) is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. Additionally, the permutation p is a list of n integers that is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '<':
                mak = i
        
        mak2 = mak
        
        pans = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            s = str(input())
            if s == '<':
                mak = i
                pans = [i]
            elif s == '=':
                pans.append(i)
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(pans)):
            print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '>':
                mak = i
        
        print('!', mak2, mak)
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: `mak` is equal to `2n - 1`, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive, and `i` is equal to the length of `pans`, which is `2n - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes inputs through a series of test cases where each case includes an integer t (the number of test cases) and for each test case, a permutation p (a list of integers that is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} where n is the size of the permutation). The function returns information about each permutation based on the given test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
