Based on the initial state provided, the variables and objects mentioned in the print statement are:

- `'?'` is a string literal.
- `mak` is not explicitly defined, so we cannot determine its value.
- `mak2` is not explicitly defined, so we cannot determine its value.
- `i` is not explicitly defined, so we cannot determine its value.

Given this information, we can only print the string literal `'?'` and the undefined variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`.

Output: **'? mak mak2 i mak2'**
