Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the range of input values.

2. **Understand the Input and Loop Execution**: The loop is driven by the input value. Specifically, the loop will run for each test case specified by the user input. The input is an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, another integer `n` is read, followed by a list `p` which is a permutation of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`.

3. **Determine the Initial State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop is driven by the user input, the initial state must include the condition under which the loop will start executing.
   - The loop will start as soon as the first input is received, meaning `t` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing.
   - No other variables are needed to be adjusted since they are not part of the loop head and their values will be determined by the input during the loop execution.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` must be at least 1**
