Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive.
   - `i` is either in the list `pans` or added to it (if `s == '<'`).
   - `pans` contains either `[i]` or `[i+1]` (if `s == '<'`) or the element `n` (if `s != '<'`).
   - `s` is assigned the value of the input string.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(n)`, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, let's assume `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, `i` will become `n` at the start of the next iteration, which means `i < n` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate.

However, if `i` was less than `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to `i + 1` in the next iteration, and the loop will continue if `i + 1 < n`.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we consider the general case where `i` is incremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `mak2` remains equal to `mak`.
- `mak` remains the same.
- `pans` and `s` remain unchanged.
- `sys.stdout.flush()` will be called again at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, `i` is `i + 1`, `pans` contains either `[i]` or `[i+1]` (if `s == '<'`) or the element `n` (if `s != '<'`), `s` is assigned the value of the input string, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.**
