Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is an input string, and the current value of `s` is `<`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `mak` now holds the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
