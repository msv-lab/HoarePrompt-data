Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of 1 or 2 and `same`, `same` is 1, 2, or 3, `num` is `ar[i]`, `ar` is updated with the first 6 integers from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, and `len(ar)` is 6.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (which is either 1 or 2) and the value of `same` (which is either 1, 2, or 3). Since `same` can only be 1, 2, or 3, and `minn` is initially either 1 or 2, `minn` will be updated to the smaller of these two values. All other variables remain unchanged.
