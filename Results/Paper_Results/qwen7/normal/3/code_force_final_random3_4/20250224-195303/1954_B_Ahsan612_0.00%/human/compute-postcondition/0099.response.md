Output State: **`minn` is infinity, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The line `minn = inf` sets the variable `minn` to infinity. All other variables (`same`, `num`, `ar`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
