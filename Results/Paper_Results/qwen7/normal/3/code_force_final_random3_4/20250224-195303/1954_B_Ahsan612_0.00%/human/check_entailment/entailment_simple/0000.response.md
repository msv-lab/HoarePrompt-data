Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
2. A beautiful array can be modified by removing an element \(a_i\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
3. The program iterates through each test case, counting the maximum number of consecutive identical elements (`same`) and keeping track of the minimum such count (`minn`).
4. If `minn` remains infinity after processing all elements, it means there were no sequences of repeated elements longer than 1, and thus, the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Hence, it prints `-1`.
5. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count of consecutive identical elements, which indicates the minimum number of elements that must be removed to break the beauty condition.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It handles the input and output as specified and correctly identifies whether the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements.

Correctness: **True**
