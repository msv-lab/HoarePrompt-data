Output State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `ar[i-1]` equals `num`, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[i-1]` based on the condition, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `i` is either 2 or 4, and `same` is set to 1 in the else part.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was either 1 or 3. After incrementing, `i` becomes either 2 or 4. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
