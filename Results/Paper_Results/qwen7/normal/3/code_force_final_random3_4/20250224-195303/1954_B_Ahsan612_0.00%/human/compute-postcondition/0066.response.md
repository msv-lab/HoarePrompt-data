The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust `i`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to be less than `len(ar)`.

Since `i` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 5 (assuming `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration).

State: **`i` is 5, `same` is 3 if `ar[4]` equals `num`, otherwise `same` remains 1**
