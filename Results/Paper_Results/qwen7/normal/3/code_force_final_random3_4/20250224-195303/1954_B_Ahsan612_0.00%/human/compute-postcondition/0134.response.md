Output State: **`minn` is the minimum value between 1 and 2, which remains 1, `same` is 2, `num` is the last number in the sequence, `ar` contains the first 6 integers from the input, `i` is 6, and `len(ar)` is 6.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`minn`) and `same`. Given that `minn` is initially the minimum value between 1 and 2 (which is 1), and `same` is 2, `minn` remains 1 after this operation. All other variables (`same`, `num`, `ar`, `i`, and `len(ar)`) remain unchanged as no other operations affect them.
