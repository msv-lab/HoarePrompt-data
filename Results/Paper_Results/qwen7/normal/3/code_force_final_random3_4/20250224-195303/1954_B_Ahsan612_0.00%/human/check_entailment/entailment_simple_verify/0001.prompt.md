You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the array is beautiful.

            print(minn)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `minn` will hold the minimum value of the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar` across all test cases. If no such minimum is found (i.e., all sequences are of length 1), `minn` will be -1. `same` will be 1 for the last iteration, `num` will be the last element of `ar` for the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `len(ar)`, and `t` will be the total number of test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful.
   - An array is considered beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Operation Explanation:**
   - The operation involves choosing an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq |a| - 1\)) such that \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\), and replacing \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\).

3. **Key Observation:**
   - For an array to be beautiful, there must be at least one sequence where the elements alternate in a way that allows the operation to be performed indefinitely.

4. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` reads the input and processes the array to find the minimum number of elements to remove.
   - It initializes `same` to count consecutive occurrences of the same element and `minn` to track the minimum length of such sequences.
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `same` and `num` when a different element is encountered.
   - After the loop, it checks if `minn` is still infinity (`inf`) and prints `-1` if no such sequence exists, otherwise, it prints `minn`.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in the code correctly identifies the minimum length of sequences where the array could potentially remain beautiful.
   - However, the code does not fully address the requirement to ensure the array stops being beautiful after removals.
   - The code only counts the minimum length of such sequences but does not account for removing elements to break these sequences.

6. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the given examples, the code seems to produce the correct results, but it might fail in more complex scenarios where the array structure is more intricate.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem because it only counts the minimum length of sequences where the array could remain beautiful, without ensuring that removing elements breaks these sequences. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
