Output State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `ar` is a list of integers created from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[0]`, `same` is 3, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `same += 1` increments the value of `same` by 1. Initially, `same` is 2, so after executing this line, `same` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
