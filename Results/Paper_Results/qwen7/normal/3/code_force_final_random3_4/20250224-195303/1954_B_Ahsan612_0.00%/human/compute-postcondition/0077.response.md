Output State: **`i` is either 7 or 8, `same` is either 2, 3, or 4, `minn` is 1 if `i` is 7, `len(ar)` must be greater than 7**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 6 or 7, after the increment, `i` becomes either 7 (if it was 6) or 8 (if it was 7). The values of `same` and `minn` remain unchanged, and the condition that `len(ar)` must be greater than 7 also remains valid.
