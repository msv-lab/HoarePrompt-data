Postcondition: `minn` is the minimum of `minn` (initially infinity) and `same` (initially 1), `ar` is a list of integers created from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `num` is either `ar[0]` if `ar[i]` equals `num`, otherwise `ar[2]`, and `same` is 3 if `ar[i]` equals `num`, otherwise `same` is 1.
