Output State: **`i` is either 6 or 7, `same` is either 3 or 4, `minn` is 1 if `i` is 7**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1. Since `same` was either 2, 3, or 4 initially, adding 1 to each of these values results in `same` being either 3 or 4. The values of `i` and `minn` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
