Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers created from the input, `minn` is the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `same` is 1.**

The code `same = 1` initializes the variable `same` to 1. This does not affect any other variables or the list `ar`. Therefore, the values of `ar`, `minn`, `t`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged.
