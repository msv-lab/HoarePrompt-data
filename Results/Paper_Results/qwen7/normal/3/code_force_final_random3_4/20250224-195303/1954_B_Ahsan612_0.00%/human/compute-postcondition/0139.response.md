Postcondition: **`minn` is the minimum value between 1 and 2, which remains 1, `same` is 2, `num` is the last number in the sequence, `ar` contains the first 6 integers from the input, `i` is 6, and `len(ar)` is 6. If `minn` is infinity, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `minn` is not infinity.**
