Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `same` is 1, and `num` is the last element of `ar` if it was not equal to the previous `num` when the loop ended, otherwise, `same` can take any value from 1 to the maximum value of `same` observed during the loop.**

Explanation:
- The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `same`. This ensures that `minn` holds the smallest value of `same` encountered during the loop.
- The values of `i`, `same`, and `num` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them within this line of code. `i` is set to the length of `ar` after the loop, `same` is reset to 1 after the loop, and `num` retains its value based on the condition specified.
