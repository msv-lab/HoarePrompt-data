Output State: **`same` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`, `i` is incremented by 1 and `i + 1` is less than `len(ar)`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The condition `i + 1 < len(ar)` is checked to ensure that `i + 1` is still less than the length of the list `ar`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
