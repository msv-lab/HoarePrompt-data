Output State: **`minn` is 1 or 2, `same` is 1, 2, or 3, `num` is `ar[i]`, `ar` is updated with the first 6 integers from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, and `len(ar)` is 6.**

Explanation: The code snippet `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Since `i` was previously incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`), the new value of `i` is one more than its previous value. All other variables retain their previous values, including `minn`, `same`, and `ar` which is updated with the first 6 integers from the input.
