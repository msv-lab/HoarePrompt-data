Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5; `n` is updated to the integer input, and `t` is updated to the integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, t = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `t` respectively. Since the initial state specified that `t` is 1, the value of `t` remains 1. The initial state also specified ranges for `n`, `u`, and `v`. After the code executes, `n` is updated to the integer input, and `t` is updated to the integer input, which is 1. The values of `u` and `v` remain within their respective ranges but are not updated by this code.
