Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `curr` is equal to the first node connected to `curr` in the `nodes` list, `tree` now contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and `e` is different from `curr`.**

Explanation: The code `curr = nodes[curr][0]` updates the value of `curr` to the first element in the list `nodes[curr]`. Since `nodes[curr]` represents the connections of `curr` in the tree structure, `curr` is now pointing to its first child node. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
