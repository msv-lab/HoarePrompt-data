Output State: The variable `prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains all elements from `s` up to and including `e`, and `curr` is equal to `e`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `curr` will eventually become equal to `e` because the loop continues to iterate as long as `curr` is not equal to `e`. Since `prev` is always set to `curr` at the end of each iteration, `prev` will also be equal to `curr` when the loop ends. The `tree` list will contain all the elements traversed from `s` to `e`, forming a path in the graph defined by the `nodes` dictionary.
