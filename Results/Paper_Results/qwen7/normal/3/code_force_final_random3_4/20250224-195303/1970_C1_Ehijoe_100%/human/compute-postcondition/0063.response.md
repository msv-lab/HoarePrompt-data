Postcondition: `prev` is equal to `curr`, `curr` is either equal to the second element in `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e` and different from `prev`, or it is equal to the first node connected to `curr` in the `nodes` list. `tree` now contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and `e` is different from `curr`.
