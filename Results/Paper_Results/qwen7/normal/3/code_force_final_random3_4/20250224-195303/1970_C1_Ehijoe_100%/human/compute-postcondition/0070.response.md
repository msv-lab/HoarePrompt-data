Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains all elements from `s` up to and including `e`, `curr` is equal to `e`, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is `[idx, n - idx - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `moves` which contains two elements: `idx` and `n - idx - 1`. The values of `prev`, `curr`, `tree`, and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial states.
