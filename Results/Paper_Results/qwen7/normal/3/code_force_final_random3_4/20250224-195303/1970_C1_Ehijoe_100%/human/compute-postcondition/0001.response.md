Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `u` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `edges` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `edges`. The values of `t`, `u`, `v`, and `n` are updated to the integer inputs, but no operations are performed on these variables. Therefore, their values remain as the inputs provided.
