Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains all elements from `s` up to and including `e`, `curr` is equal to `e`, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**

Explanation: The code `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of `start` within the list `tree` and assigns it to the variable `idx`. The values of `prev`, `curr`, and `tree` remain unchanged from their initial states.
