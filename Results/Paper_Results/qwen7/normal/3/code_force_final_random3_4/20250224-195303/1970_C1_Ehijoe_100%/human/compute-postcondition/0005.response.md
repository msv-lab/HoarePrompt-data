Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `u` and `v`. The variables `i` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` remains 0, and `n` must still be at least 2, while `u` and `v` are assigned the values of the input integers.
