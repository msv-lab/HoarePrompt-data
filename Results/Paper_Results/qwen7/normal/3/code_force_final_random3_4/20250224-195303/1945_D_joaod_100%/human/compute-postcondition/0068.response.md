Output State: **`na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is an input integer, `c` is incremented by 1, `total` holds the minimum cumulative cost from the start position (`na_frente - 2`) to the end position (`-1`), considering the costs of switching to path `a` or passing through path `b` at each step, `cases` remains the same, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The value of `na_frente` is decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The other variables (`pos_final`, `c`, `total`, `cases`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`) retain their initial states.
