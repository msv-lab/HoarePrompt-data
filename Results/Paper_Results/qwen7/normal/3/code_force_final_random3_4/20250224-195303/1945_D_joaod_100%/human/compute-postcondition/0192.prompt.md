Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `na_frente` is now decreased by 2, `c` is 0, `v` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `total` is 0, `best` is set to the maximum floating-point value.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is an integer ranging from `na_frente` down to 1, `c` is 0, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `total` is updated by adding either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` is updated to the maximum of `best` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v` is within the range specified by `na_frente` and `pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is an integer ranging from `na_frente` down to 2 (or -1 if `v` was already -1), `c` is 0, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `total` is updated by adding either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value depending on the condition, and `best` is updated to the maximum of `best` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v` is within the range specified by `na_frente` and `pos_final`. If `v` is within the range and `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` remains unchanged; otherwise, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `best` is compared with `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. In either case, `total` is increased by the respective cost (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if the if condition is true, or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if the else condition is true), and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` remains unchanged. If `v > pos_final`, `total` is updated to its current value plus either the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` (if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) or the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` (if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] >= custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
