Output State: **`na_frente` is now decreased by 2, `c` is 0, `v` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `total` is 0, `best` is set to the maximum floating-point value.**

Explanation: The code sets the variable `best` to the maximum floating-point value using `sys.float_info.max`. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `na_frente`, `c`, `v`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `total` remain unchanged.
