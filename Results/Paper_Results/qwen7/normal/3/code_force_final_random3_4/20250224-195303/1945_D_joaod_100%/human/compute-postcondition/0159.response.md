Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is an integer ranging from `na_frente` down to 1, `c` is 0, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is set to the maximum floating-point value, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

This means that the `total` variable has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
