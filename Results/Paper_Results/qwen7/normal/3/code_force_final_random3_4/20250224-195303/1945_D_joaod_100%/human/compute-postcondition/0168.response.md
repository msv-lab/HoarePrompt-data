Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is an integer ranging from `na_frente` down to 2 (or -1 if `v` was already -1), `c` is 0, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its current value, `best` is updated to the maximum of `best` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v` is within the range specified by `na_frente` and `pos_final`, and if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` remains unchanged; otherwise, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v` is within the specified range.**

This means that the variable `total` has been incremented by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables remain in their previous states, with `total` updated accordingly.
