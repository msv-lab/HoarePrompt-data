Output State: **`na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `c` is incremented by 1, `total` holds the minimum cumulative cost from the start position (`na_frente - 2`) to the end position (`-1`), considering the costs of switching to path `a` or passing through path `b` at each step, `cases` remains the same, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input using `input().split()` and maps each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. The values of `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `c`, `total`, `cases`, and the previous state of `custo_pra_passar_b` (which was empty before this line) remain unchanged. The new value of `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers derived from the input.
