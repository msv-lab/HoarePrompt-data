Output State: **`na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `c` is incremented by 1, `total` holds the minimum cumulative cost from the start position (`na_frente - 2`) to the end position (`-1`), considering the costs of switching to path `a` or passing through path `b` at each step, `cases` remains the same, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and maps them to integers, storing the result in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
