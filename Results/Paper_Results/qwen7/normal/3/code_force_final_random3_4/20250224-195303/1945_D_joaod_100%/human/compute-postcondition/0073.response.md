Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the range for the variable `v`. The variables involved in the loop head are `v`, `na_frente`, and the step `-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `v`**: The loop starts with `v` taking the value of `na_frente` and decrements `v` by 1 until `v` reaches `-1`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1`. If `na_frente` is less than `-1`, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `total` is 0 and does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - `pos_final` is an input integer - 1 and does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `c` is incremented by 1 and does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `best` is `sys.float_info.max` and does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `cases` remains the same and does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers and does not affect the loop's execution.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `na_frente` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

**State:**
**`na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1**
