Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4. All other variables (t, n, m, a, b) are not yet defined.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = sys.float_info.max
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `total` will hold the minimum cumulative cost from the start position (`na_frente - 2`) to the end position (`-1`), considering the costs of switching to path `a` or passing through path `b` at each step. The loop iterates backward from `na_frente - 2` to `-1`, updating `total` based on the minimum cost option at each step.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `v` will be -1, `pos_final` will be an integer, and `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs (either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration where `v` is within the range defined by `na_frente` to 0, inclusive. The variable `best` will hold the maximum value between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev]` whenever `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All iterations of the loop have been executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
