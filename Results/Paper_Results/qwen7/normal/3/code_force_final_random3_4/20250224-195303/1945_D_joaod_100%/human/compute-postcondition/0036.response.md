Postcondition: `total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1`, where `v` is the original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to -1, and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `total` remains unchanged and `v` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `total` is updated to the minimum cost between `best` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `v` is decremented by 1.
