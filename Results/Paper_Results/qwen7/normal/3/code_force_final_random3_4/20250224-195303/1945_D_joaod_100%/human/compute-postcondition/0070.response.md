Output State: **`total` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 2`, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `c` is incremented by 1, `total` holds the minimum cumulative cost from the start position (`na_frente - 3`) to the end position (`-1`), considering the costs of switching to path `a` or passing through path `b` at each step, `cases` remains the same, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The line `total = 0` sets the variable `total` to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `c`, `total` (except that it is now set to 0), `cases`, or `custo_pra_passar_b`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states except for `total`, which is explicitly set to 0.
