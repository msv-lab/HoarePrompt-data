Output State: **`i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[u]` contains `[u, v]`, `n` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Initially, `nodes[v]` contains `[u]`, so after appending `v`, `nodes[u]` will contain `[u, v]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, `v`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 remain unchanged.
