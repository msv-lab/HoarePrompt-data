Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a tree with `n` nodes.
   - There are `t` rounds, but since `t=1`, we only need to consider one round.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Concepts:**
   - The game can be analyzed using the concept of "nim-sum" or "grundy numbers" in combinatorial game theory.
   - For a single node, the Grundy number (or nim-value) is 0 if the node has an even number of children, and 1 if it has an odd number of children.
   - The Grundy number for a node is the minimum excludant (mex) of the Grundy numbers of its children.

3. **Provided Functions:**
   - **func_1:** This function calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes. However, it is not directly used in the solution.
   - **func_2:** This function reads the input and calculates the Grundy numbers for the starting node and its neighbors.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - `n` and `t` are read from input.
     - `t` is always 1, so we only need to process one starting node.
   - **Building the Tree:**
     - An adjacency list `nodes` is constructed.
     - Leaves are identified and stored in a deque.
   - **Calculating Grundy Numbers:**
     - `start` is the initial node where the stone is placed.
     - `moves` is calculated using `func_1`, but it seems to be misused here.
     - The condition checks if any distance in `moves` is odd. If so, "Ron" wins; otherwise, "Hermione" wins.

5. **Grundy Number Calculation:**
   - The correct approach would be to calculate the Grundy number for the starting node and its neighbors.
   - The Grundy number for a node is 0 if it has an even number of children, and 1 if it has an odd number of children.
   - The player who faces a Grundy number of 0 will lose if both players play optimally.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The provided code does not correctly calculate the Grundy numbers.
   - It uses `func_1` incorrectly and does not handle the Grundy number calculation properly.
   - The condition `if any([move % 2 == 1 for move in moves]):` is incorrect because it checks distances instead of Grundy numbers.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the Grundy numbers. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
