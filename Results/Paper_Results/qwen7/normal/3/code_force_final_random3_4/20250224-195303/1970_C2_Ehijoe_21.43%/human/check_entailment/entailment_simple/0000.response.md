### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game and Problem:**
   - The game involves a tree with \( n \) nodes.
   - There are \( t = 1 \) round.
   - Players take turns moving a stone from one node to an unactivated neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(nodes, start, parent)`**: This function calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree. It uses a recursive approach to find these distances.
   - **`func_2()`**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, identifies leaf nodes, and then calls `func_1` to get the distances. Based on whether any of these distances are odd, it determines the winner.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly calculates the distances using a depth-first search (DFS) approach.
   - It handles the base case where a node has only one neighbor (itself), returning `[0]`.
   - For other nodes, it recursively calculates distances and adds 1 to include the current node's distance.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function correctly constructs the tree from the input edges.
   - It identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a deque.
   - It reads the starting node and calls `func_1` to get the distances.
   - The logic to determine the winner is correct:
     - If any distance is odd, Ron wins.
     - If all distances are even, Hermione wins.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the single round case correctly.
   - The input constraints are respected.

6. **Overall Logic:**
   - The overall logic of the program matches the problem statement and the optimal strategy for the game.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It accurately calculates the distances and determines the winner based on the parity of the distances.

**Correctness: **True**
