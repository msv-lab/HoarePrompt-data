Output State: **`i` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[u]` contains `[v]`**

Explanation: The code appends `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Initially, `nodes[u]` contains `[u]`. After executing the line `nodes[u].append(v)`, `nodes[u]` will contain both `u` and `v`, which can be represented as `[u, v]`. However, since `u` is an input integer, we represent it as such to maintain generality.
