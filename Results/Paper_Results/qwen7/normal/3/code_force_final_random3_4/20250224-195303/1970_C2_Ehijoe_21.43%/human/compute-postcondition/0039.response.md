Postcondition: `leaves` is a deque containing all nodes that have only one neighbor in the tree, `moves` is the result of calling `func_1(nodes, start)`, `start` is an input integer, and if there exists at least one move in `moves` which is an odd number, then no specific change is mentioned for `leaves` and `moves`. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even numbers.
