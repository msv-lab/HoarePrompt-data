Output State: **`i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` contains `[u]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `u` is assigned the value of the first integer input, `v` is assigned the value of the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `u` and `v` respectively. The initial values of `i`, `nodes[v]`, and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
