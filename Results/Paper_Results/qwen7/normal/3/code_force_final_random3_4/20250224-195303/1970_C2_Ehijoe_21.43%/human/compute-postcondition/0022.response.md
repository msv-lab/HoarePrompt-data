Postcondition: `nodes` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` nodes. If the length of the list associated with the key is 1, it is updated to 2, and `leaves` is a list containing the key. If the length of the list associated with the key is not 1, the state of `nodes` and `leaves` remains unchanged.
