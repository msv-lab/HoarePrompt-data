Output State: **`i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, nodes[v] contains [u]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Initially, `nodes[v]` contains the value `v`. After executing the code, `nodes[v]` will contain `[v, u]`. However, since the initial state only specifies that `nodes[v]` contains `v`, the updated state is that `nodes[v]` now contains `[u]` (assuming `nodes[v]` was initially empty or contained only `v`). The values of `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
