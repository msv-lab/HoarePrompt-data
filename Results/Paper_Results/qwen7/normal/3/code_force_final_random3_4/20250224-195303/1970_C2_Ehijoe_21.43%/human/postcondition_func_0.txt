The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `nodes`, an integer `start`, and an optional integer `parent`. It processes the `nodes` dictionary to calculate distances from the `start` node to other nodes in the graph. If the `start` node has only one neighbor which is the `parent`, it returns a list containing the single element 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances to all other neighbors of the `start` node, excluding the `parent` node, and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the distance from the `start` node to a neighboring node, calculated as 1 plus the distance obtained from recursive calls to `func_1`.
