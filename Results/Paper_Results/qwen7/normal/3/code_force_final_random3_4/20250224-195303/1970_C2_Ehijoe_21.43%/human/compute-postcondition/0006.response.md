Output State: **`i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, nodes[u] contains v**

Explanation: The line `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list located at index `u` in the `nodes` list. Since `u` and `v` are input integers, the value of `nodes[u]` is updated to include `v`. The variables `i` and `u` remain unchanged from their initial states.
