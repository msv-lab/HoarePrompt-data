The `while True` loop runs indefinitely until explicitly broken out of. In this case, the loop was broken out of because `vis[ps - 1]` was set to 1 and `ps` was updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and then a break statement was encountered.

Since the loop is `while True`, it can certainly execute one more time without any conditions. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop head variables to allow the loop to proceed.

State: **`vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`**
