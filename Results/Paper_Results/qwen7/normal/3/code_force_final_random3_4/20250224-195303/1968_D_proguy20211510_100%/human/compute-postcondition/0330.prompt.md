Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `p` is a permutation of length `n`; `a` is an array of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i; `YES` is a string equal to 'YES'; `NO` is a string equal to 'NO'; `MOD` is 1000000007; `alpha` is a string containing the characters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pathb, paths = [], []
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[pb - 1] = 1
    while True:
        pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
        if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
            break
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[ps - 1] = 1
    while True:
        paths.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]
        if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
            break
    resb, ress = 0, 0
    preb, pres = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(pathb)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
        preb += pathb[i]
        resb = max(resb, curr)
    for i in range(len(paths)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
        pres += paths[i]
        ress = max(ress, curr)
    if resb > ress:
        print('Bodya')
    elif ress > resb:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, and `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `resb` becomes the new value of `ress`. Otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the length of `paths`, `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`, `curr` is the value of `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * k`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, and `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value and any `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, updated based on whether `resb` is greater than `ress`. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, `ress` is updated to the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`. Otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is equal to the total number of elements in the `paths` list, `curr` holds the value of `pres` plus the last element of `paths` multiplied by the difference between `k` and the index of the last element, `pres` is the sum of all elements in the `paths` list, and `ress` contains the maximum value between its initial value and the calculated `curr` value for each iteration. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `resb` is used to update `ress`; otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
