Postcondition: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1; `num_iterations` is decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the original `n`; `k` is the integer value of the original `k`; `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration; `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers entered by the user; `a` is a list of integers entered by the user; `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop; `paths` is a list with the element `a[ps - 1]` appended; and the condition `vis[ps - 1] == 1` is true.**
