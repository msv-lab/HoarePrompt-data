Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `preb` is equal to `preb` + `pathb[i]`; `curr` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `preb += pathb[i]` updates the value of `preb` by adding `pathb[i]` to its current value. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state. The value of `curr` remains unchanged because the code does not affect `curr`.
