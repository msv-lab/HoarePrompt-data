Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `pathb`, `k` is less than `i + 1`, `curr` is calculated as `preb + pathb[4] * (k - 5)` if `pathb` has more than 5 elements, otherwise it will be the last valid `curr` value, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value between all `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, and the loop is fully executed without breaking out early.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of `pathb`, `k` will be greater than or equal to the length of `pathb`, `preb` will be the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` will hold the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop, and the loop will have completed all its iterations without any early breaks.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2, `len(paths)` is known, `k` is 1, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the last valid `curr` value, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3, `pres` is `pres` + `paths[3]`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4, `k` is less than 5, `curr` is `pres` + `paths[4]` * (`k` - 4), `pres` is increased by `paths[4]`, `ress` is the maximum between `ress` and `curr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
