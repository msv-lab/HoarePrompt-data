Output State: **`i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the value of `i`, which was initially 3. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no such loop or if statement is provided in the code, the value of `i` remains unchanged.
