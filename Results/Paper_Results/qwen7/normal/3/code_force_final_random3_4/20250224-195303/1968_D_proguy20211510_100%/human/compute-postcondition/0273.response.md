Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with one element set to 1, indicating a cycle was detected, `num_iterations` is fully decremented to 0, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration, `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` after the last iteration, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop that must have at least 1 element, `paths` is a list containing all the elements `a[ps - 1]` appended from each iteration until the loop broke, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block that was checking the condition `k < i + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values, and no new assignments are made. Therefore, the output state includes all the variables in their previous states, with the additional information that we have broken out of the loop or conditional block.
