Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, and `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values. The current value of `ress` is greater than the value of `resb`.
