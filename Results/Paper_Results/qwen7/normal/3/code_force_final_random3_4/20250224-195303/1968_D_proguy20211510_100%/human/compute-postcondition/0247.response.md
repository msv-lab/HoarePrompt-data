Output State: `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `num_iterations` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]` until it breaks out of the loop, `ps` is the integer value of the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements appended in each iteration until `pb` points to an already visited index, `paths` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, and `pathb` contains the sequence of indices traversed from the starting point until a previously visited index was encountered, causing the loop to break. The other variables retain their states as they were after the third iteration since no further changes are made outside the loop.
