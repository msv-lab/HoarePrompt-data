### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - It correctly parses the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.

2. **Permutation and Array Reading:**
   - The program reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` correctly using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Path Calculation for Bodya:**
   - The program initializes `pathb` to store the scores Bodya would get if he stays at his current position and moves to the next one according to the permutation.
   - It uses a `vis` array to ensure it doesn't revisit positions, which is crucial for avoiding infinite loops.
   - The loop correctly calculates the scores for Bodya's path.

4. **Path Calculation for Sasha:**
   - Similarly, the program initializes `paths` to store the scores Sasha would get if she stays at her current position and moves to the next one according to the permutation.
   - It uses a `vis` array to ensure it doesn't revisit positions.
   - The loop correctly calculates the scores for Sasha's path.

5. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya (`resb`) and Sasha (`ress`) using a loop that iterates up to `k` turns.
   - It correctly updates the scores based on the remaining turns.

6. **Result Determination:**
   - The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

### Issues Identified:
- The program uses `YES` and `NO` variables defined at the beginning but never uses them. These should be removed or used if they were intended for something else.
- The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than the length of the path. This is handled correctly in the code by breaking the loop when `k < i + 1`.
- The program assumes that the paths will be fully traversed within `k` turns, which is correct since the paths are finite and the loop breaks early if `k` is less than the path length.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Initialization and Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly initializes variables and reads inputs as required.
  - The use of `vis` arrays ensures that the program does not revisit positions, preventing infinite loops.

- **Path Construction:**
  - The paths for Bodya and Sasha are constructed correctly by following the permutation.
  - The `vis` arrays are used effectively to avoid revisiting positions.

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by iterating up to `k` turns and updating the scores accordingly.
  - The loop breaks early if `k` is less than the current iteration index, ensuring that only valid turns are considered.

- **Result Determination:**
  - The program compares the final scores and prints the correct result based on the comparison.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program and the provided function summary, it is clear that the program logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the code.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
