Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of positive integers \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), \( P_S \), a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \), and an array \( a \) of positive integers. For each test case, it constructs two paths based on the permutations and calculates the maximum possible sums for these paths under a given constraint \( k \). Based on the comparison of these sums, it outputs either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' for each test case.**
