Output State: `i` is equal to the total number of iterations, which is the length of `paths`; `curr` is `pres` + `paths[i-1]` * (`k` - (`i` - 1)); `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`; `ress` is the maximum value calculated from `ress` and `curr` during each iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `i` will be equal to the total number of elements in the `paths` list.
- The variable `curr` will hold the value of `pres` plus the last element of `paths` multiplied by the difference between `k` and the index of the last element.
- The variable `pres` will be the sum of all elements in the `paths` list.
- The variable `ress` will contain the maximum value between its initial value and the calculated `curr` value for each iteration.
