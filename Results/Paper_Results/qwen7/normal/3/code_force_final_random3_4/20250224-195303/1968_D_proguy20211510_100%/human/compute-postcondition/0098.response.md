Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is less than 5, and `curr` is `pres` + `paths[4]` * (`k` - 4); `pres` is increased by `paths[4]`.**

Explanation: The variable `pres` is incremented by the value of `paths[i]`, which is `paths[4]` given that `i` is 4. The values of `i`, `k`, and `curr` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
