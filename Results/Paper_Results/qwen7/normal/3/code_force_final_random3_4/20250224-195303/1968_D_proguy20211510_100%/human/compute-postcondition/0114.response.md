Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values, `n` is the first input string, `k` is the second input string, `pb` is the third input string, `ps` is the fourth input string.**

The code splits the input into four parts and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. The values of `i`, `k`, `preb`, `resb`, and `ress` remain unchanged from their initial state. The input strings are stored in `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` respectively.
