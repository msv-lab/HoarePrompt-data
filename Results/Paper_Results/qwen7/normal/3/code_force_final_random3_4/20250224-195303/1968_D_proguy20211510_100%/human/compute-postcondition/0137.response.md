Output State: `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values, `pathb` contains all elements added during the loop iterations until `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, `paths` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input string, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is an integer from the fourth input string, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the first input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.

This means that the loop continues appending elements to `pathb` and updating `pb` until it encounters an already visited index in `vis`. At that point, the loop breaks, and the final state of `pathb` will be a list of all elements traversed until the cycle was detected. The other variables (`vis`, `i`, `k`, `preb`, `resb`, `ress`, `paths`, `n`, `ps`, `p`, and `a`) retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
