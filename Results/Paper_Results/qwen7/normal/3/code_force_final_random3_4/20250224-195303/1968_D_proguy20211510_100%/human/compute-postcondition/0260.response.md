Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1; `num_iterations` remains decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the original `n`; `k` is the integer value of the original `k`; `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration; `ps` remains updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers entered by the user; `a` is a list of integers entered by the user; `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop; `paths` now contains the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to its previous content; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or block of code it is within. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or block where the `vis`, `num_iterations`, `pb`, `ps`, and other variables might have been modified. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variable's value directly, the values of these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed. The states of `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` also remain unchanged.
