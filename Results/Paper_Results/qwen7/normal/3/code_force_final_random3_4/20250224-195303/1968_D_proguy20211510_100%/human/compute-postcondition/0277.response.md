Output State: **`resb` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `curr`, `vis` is a list of n zeros with one element set to 1, indicating a cycle was detected, `num_iterations` is fully decremented to 0, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration, `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` after the last iteration, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop that must have at least 1 element, `paths` is a list containing all the elements `a[ps - 1]` appended from each iteration until the loop broke, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is 0, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`**

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
