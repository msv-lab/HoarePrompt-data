Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros, `num_iterations` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` is the integer value of the original `pb`, `ps` is the integer value of the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `vis` of length `n` with all elements set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `num_iterations`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, or `paths`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged except for `num_iterations` which is implicitly decremented by 1 due to the initial state description.
