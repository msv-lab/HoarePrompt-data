Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `num_iterations` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` is the integer value of the original `pb`, `ps` is the integer value of the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.**

This means that the `vis` list now has its element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, while all other elements remain 0. The other variables retain their original values from the initial state.
