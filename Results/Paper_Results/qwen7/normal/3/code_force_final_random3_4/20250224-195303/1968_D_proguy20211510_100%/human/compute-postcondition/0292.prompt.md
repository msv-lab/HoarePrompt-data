Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vis` is a list of n zeros with one element set to 1, indicating a cycle was detected; `num_iterations` is fully decremented to 0; `n` is the integer value of the original `n`; `k` is the integer value of the original `k`; `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration; `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` after the last iteration; `p` is a list of integers entered by the user; `a` is a list of integers entered by the user; `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop; `paths` is a list containing all the elements `a[ps - 1]` appended from each iteration until the loop broke; `resb` is 0; `ress` is 0; `preb` is 0; `pres` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `resb` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `curr`, `vis` is a list of n zeros with one element set to 1, indicating a cycle was detected, `num_iterations` is fully decremented to 0, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration, `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` after the last iteration, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop that must have at least 1 element, `paths` is a list containing all the elements `a[ps - 1]` appended from each iteration until the loop broke, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is 0, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1; `preb` is equal to `preb` + `pathb[i]`; `curr` remains unchanged; `resb` is the maximum of its current value and `curr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[i-1] + pathb[i]`, `curr` is unchanged, `resb` is the maximum of its current value and `preb + pathb[i-1] * (k - (i-1))`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
