Output State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the first split value from input, `k` is the second split value from input, `pb` is the third split value from input, `ps` is the fourth split value from input.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string into four parts using the `split()` function, assigning each part to the respective variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. The initial state's condition that `input_value` must be a positive integer remains unchanged, but now `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are assigned the values from the split input.
