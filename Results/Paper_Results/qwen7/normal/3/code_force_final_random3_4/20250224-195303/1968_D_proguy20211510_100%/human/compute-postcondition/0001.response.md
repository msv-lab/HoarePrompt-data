Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `p` is a permutation of length `n`; `a` is an array of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i; `YES` is a string equal to 'YES'; `NO` is a string equal to 'NO'; `MOD` is 1000000007.**

The code initializes the variable `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is a constant used for modulo operations to prevent overflow. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `YES`, or `NO`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `MOD` is updated to its new value.
