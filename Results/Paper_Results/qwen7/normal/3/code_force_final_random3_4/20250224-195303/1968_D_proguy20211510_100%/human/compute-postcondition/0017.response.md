The `while True` loop does not have any conditions based on the variables inside the loop head. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time since the loop will continue indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of.

However, since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute again unless there is an explicit break condition elsewhere in the code. Given the information provided, no changes are necessary to the current state for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]]`, where `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1, and the condition `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1 holds true, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
