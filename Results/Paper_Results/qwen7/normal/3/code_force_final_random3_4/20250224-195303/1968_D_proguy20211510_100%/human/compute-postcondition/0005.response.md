Output State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is the converted integer value of the third split value from input, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input.**

In this case, the code converts the split values from the input into integers. The initial conditions for `input_value`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain valid, but their values are now explicitly converted to integers.
