Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with one element set to 1, indicating a cycle was detected; `num_iterations` is fully decremented to 0; `n` is the integer value of the original `n`; `k` is the integer value of the original `k`; `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration; `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` after the last iteration; `p` is a list of integers entered by the user; `a` is a list of integers entered by the user; `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop; `paths` is a list containing all the elements `a[ps - 1]` appended from each iteration until the loop broke; `resb` is 0; `ress` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `resb` and `ress`, both set to 0. This does not affect the values of the previously mentioned variables. Therefore, the output state retains the values of all the other variables as described in the initial state, with the addition of `resb` and `ress` both being 0.
