Output State: **`i` is 1, `curr` is `preb` + `pathb[0]` * (`k` - 0)**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is assigned the value of `preb` plus `pathb[i]` multiplied by `(k - i)`. Given that `i` was initially 0, `i` is now updated to 1. The value of `curr` is calculated as `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, which simplifies to `preb + pathb[0] * k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
