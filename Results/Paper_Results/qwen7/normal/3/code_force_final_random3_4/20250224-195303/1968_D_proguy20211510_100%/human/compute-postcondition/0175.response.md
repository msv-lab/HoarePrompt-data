Output State: **`curr` is `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`, `i` is 3, `preb` is `preb + pathb[2]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `preb` by adding `pathb[i]` to it. Given that `i` was initially 2, after the line `preb += pathb[i]`, `i` becomes 3 (since `i` is incremented implicitly when accessing the next index in the list). The value of `curr` remains unchanged as it was defined before and does not get updated by this line of code.
