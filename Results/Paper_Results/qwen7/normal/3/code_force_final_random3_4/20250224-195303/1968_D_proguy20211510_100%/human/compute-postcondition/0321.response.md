Postcondition: `i` is equal to the total number of elements in the `paths` list, `curr` will hold the value of `pres` plus the last element of `paths` multiplied by the difference between `k` and the index of the last element, `pres` will be the sum of all elements in the `paths` list, and `ress` will contain the maximum value between its initial value and the calculated `curr` value for each iteration. The value of `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`. Additionally, the condition `ress > resb` is true.
