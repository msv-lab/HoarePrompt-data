State before the loop starts: All iterations of the loop have been executed.

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(paths)`. Since all iterations of the loop have been executed, this means that the loop ran from `i = 0` to `i = len(paths) - 1`. Therefore, `i` must have reached the value of `len(paths)` after the last iteration.

Given that the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` must be equal to `len(paths)`, and `len(paths)` itself must have been a valid positive integer (since a non-positive length would prevent the loop from running).

So, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is `len(paths)` and `len(paths)` is a valid positive integer.

State: **`i` is `len(paths)`, `len(paths)` must be a positive integer**
