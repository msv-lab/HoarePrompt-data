Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the solution does not account for the fact that when a new problem is added, the array `a` needs to be sorted and the last element removed. Instead, the solution simply counts how many times `b[j]` is less than `a[i]` without actually performing the insertion and sorting steps.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the process of inserting new problems with increasing difficulties until all `a[i]` are less than or equal to `b[i]`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                a.insert(i, b[i])
                a.sort()
                a.pop()
                cnt += 1
            i += 1
        print(cnt)

func()
```

This corrected program properly simulates the process of inserting new problems with the necessary difficulty levels and ensures that the array `a` is always sorted and the last element is removed after each insertion.
