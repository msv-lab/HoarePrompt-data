Output State: **`_` is t, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The initial values of `_` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` is updated to `b`, which is a new list of integers obtained from the input string.
