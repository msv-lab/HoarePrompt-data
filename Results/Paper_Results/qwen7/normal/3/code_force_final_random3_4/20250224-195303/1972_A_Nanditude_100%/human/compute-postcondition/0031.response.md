Output State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1, or any value up to `n-1`, `t` is a positive integer that can be incremented, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The other variables (`cnt`, `t`, `b`, `i`, `j`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
