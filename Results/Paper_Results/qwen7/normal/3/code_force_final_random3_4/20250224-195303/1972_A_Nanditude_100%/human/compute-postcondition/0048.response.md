Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 2, `j` is `j + 1`**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `cnt` is increased by 1 and `j` is `j + 1`. The code `cnt += 1` increments `cnt` by 1. Therefore, `cnt` is now increased by 1 (from its initial increase) plus another 1, making it increased by 2 in total. The value of `j` remains as `j + 1` since no changes were made to it in the given code.
