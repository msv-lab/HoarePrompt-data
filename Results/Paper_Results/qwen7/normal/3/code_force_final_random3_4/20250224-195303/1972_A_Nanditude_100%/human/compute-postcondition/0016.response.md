Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` which ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `cnt` is either 0 or 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue if `j` is less than `n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - `i` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `cnt` remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop body changes it, but since no such change is specified, `cnt` stays as it was.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
