Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `t` is a positive integer that can be incremented, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `b` is a list of integers entered by the user via `map(int, input().split())`, `i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `i = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
