Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `previous_j + 2`, `i` is increased by 1**.

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was previously the same as the previous iteration or increased by 1, now it is increased by 1 from its previous state. The conditions for `n` and the relationship of `j` to `previous_j` remain unchanged.
