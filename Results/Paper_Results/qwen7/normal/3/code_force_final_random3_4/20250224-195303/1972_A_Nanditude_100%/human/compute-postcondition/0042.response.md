Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `cnt` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.
- Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
- The loop variable `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`.
- There are no other variables directly controlled within the loop head.

### Adjusting the States
- Since the loop variable `j` is the only variable directly controlled within the loop head, we need to adjust its state.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been incremented by 1 (unless it was the last value in the range).

### Determining the New State
- If `j` was the last value in the range (i.e., `j == n-1`), then the loop will terminate.
- If `j` was not the last value, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

### Conclusion
Since the loop condition depends on the value of `j`, and assuming `j` was not the last value in the range, `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `i` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `j` is increased by 1**.

However, since we are asked to provide the state at the start of the next iteration, and `j` is incremented by 1, the new state for `j` is `j + 1`.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `i` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `j` is 1 more than its previous value**.

If we denote the previous value of `j` as `j_prev`, then the new state is:
State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `b[j_prev]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `i` is increased by 1 if `b[j_prev]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `j` is `j_prev + 1`**.
