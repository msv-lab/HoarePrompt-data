Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 0. After executing the code, `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
