Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` is incremented by the number of times `b[j]` is less than `a[i]` during the loop execution.
- `i` is incremented each time the condition `b[j] >= a[i]` is true.
- `j` iterates from 0 to `n-1` throughout the loop.

To determine the value of `cnt`, we need to consider how many times `b[j]` is less than `a[i]` during the loop execution. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, we know that `cnt` will be the count of such occurrences.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the count of times b[j] is less than a[i] during the loop execution)**
