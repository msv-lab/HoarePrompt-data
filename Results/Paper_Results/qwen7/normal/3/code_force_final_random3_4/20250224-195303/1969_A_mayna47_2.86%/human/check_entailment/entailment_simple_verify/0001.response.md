### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Friend Best Friend Mapping**: In `func_1`, it correctly initializes a list `v` to store the best friend mapping and updates it with the input values.
3. **Special Case for Two Friends**: For `n = 2`, the program correctly prints `2` because both friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
4. **Checking for Direct Pairings**: The program checks if there exists a pair `(i, v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This check is intended to find a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and thus would both come to the party if invited. However, the logic for this check is flawed. Specifically, the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` does not necessarily mean that both friends in the pair will come to the party. For example, consider the input `p = [2, 1]`:
   - `v = [0, 2, 1]`
   - For `i = 1`: `v[v[v[1]]] = v[v[2]] = v[1] = 2`, but only friend 1 would come, not both.
   - For `i = 2`: `v[v[v[2]]] = v[v[1]] = v[2] = 1`, but only friend 2 would come, not both.
   - Therefore, the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` does not guarantee that both friends in the pair will come to the party.
5. **General Case**: If no direct pairings exist, the program prints `3`, which is the correct answer based on the problem statement and examples provided. However, the program incorrectly assumes that if no direct pairings exist, then inviting 3 friends will always ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. This is not necessarily true, as the problem does not guarantee that inviting 3 friends will result in at least 2 coming to the party. For example, consider the input `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`:
   - Inviting friends `[1, 2, 4, 5]` results in friends `[2, 4, 5]` coming, but inviting friends `[1, 2, 3]` also results in friends `[2, 4, 5]` coming, which is the same as before.

Given the above points, the program logic is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the special case for `n = 2` and the general case for larger `n`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle all the given scenarios and examples provided in the problem statement.

### Final:
**False**
