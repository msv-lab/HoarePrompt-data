Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly identifies the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends (`n`) and their best friends' indices (`p`).
3. The function `func_1()` constructs a list `v` where `v[i]` represents the best friend of the friend with index `i-1` (since list indices start from 0).
4. The function then checks if there exists any pair of friends who are each other's best friends' best friends. This is checked using the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i`.
5. If such a pair exists, it means that sending invitations to these two friends will ensure that both come to the party, hence the function prints `2` and returns.
6. If no such pair exists, the function prints `3`, indicating that at least three friends need to be invited to ensure at least two friends come to the party.

Given the logic and the constraints, the provided solution correctly handles all the test cases described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
