Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` equals 2, `p` is a list of 2 integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ 2, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct; `v` is a list of length 3 where each element is equal to an integer input split from the input string and converted to an integer.**
