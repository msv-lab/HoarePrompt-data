You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
        print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: Output State: The loop will execute for all values of `i` from 1 to `n`. After all iterations, if none of the conditions `v[v[v[i]]] == i` are met for any `i` in the range 1 to `n`, the function will not return anything and will exit the loop. Therefore, the values of `i` will range from 1 to `n`, `n` will remain between 2 and 50 inclusive, and the value of `v[v[v[i]]]` for each `i` from 1 to `n` will not equal `i`.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ `n`, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is an integer. If `n` equals 2, `p` is a list of 2 integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length 3 where each element is an integer. If none of the conditions `v[v[v[i]]] == i` are met for any `i` in the range 1 to `n`, the function will not return anything and will exit the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of length `n` from the input. It then checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i` for a constructed list `v`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and exits. If no such index exists, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Friend Best Friend Mapping**: In `func_1`, it correctly initializes a list `v` to store the best friend mapping and updates it with the input values.
3. **Special Case for Two Friends**: For `n = 2`, the program correctly prints `2` because both friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
4. **Checking for Direct Pairings**: The program checks if there exists a pair `(i, v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a pair exists, it means inviting both friends in this pair will ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. In this case, the program prints `2`.
5. **General Case**: If no direct pairings exist, the program prints `3`, which is the correct answer based on the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be correct according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles all the given scenarios and examples provided in the problem statement.
