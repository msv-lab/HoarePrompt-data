Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ `n`, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is an integer. If `n` equals 2, `p` is a list of 2 integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length 3 where each element is an integer. If none of the conditions `v[v[v[i]]] == i` are met for any `i` in the range 1 to `n`, the function will not return anything and will exit the loop.**
