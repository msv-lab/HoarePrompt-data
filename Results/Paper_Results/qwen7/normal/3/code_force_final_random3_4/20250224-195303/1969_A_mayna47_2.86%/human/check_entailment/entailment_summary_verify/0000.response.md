### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Monocarp wants to invite friends to a party such that at least 2 friends come.
- Each friend \(i\) has a best friend \(p_i\).
- A friend \(i\) will come to the party if both \(i\) and \(p_i\) receive invitations.
- We need to find the minimum number of invitations required.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1()` reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of length `n`.
- It constructs a list `v` with `v[i] = p[i]` for \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
- It then checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`.
- If such an index is found, it prints `2` and exits.
- If no such index exists, it prints `3`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading and List Construction**:
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   v = [0] * (n + 1)
   v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of friends `n` and constructs the list `v` where `v[i] = p[i]`.

2. **Handling the Case \(n = 2\)**:
   ```python
   if n == 2:
       print(2)
   ```
   This handles the special case where there are only 2 friends. In this case, the program correctly prints `2` because both friends must be invited to ensure at least 2 friends attend.

3. **Checking for a Pair of Friends**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
           print(2)
           return
   ```
   This loop checks if there exists a pair of friends \(i\) and \(p_i\) such that both \(i\) and \(p_i\) will attend the party. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and exits.

4. **Default Case**:
   ```python
   print(3)
   ```
   If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, indicating that all friends must be invited to ensure at least 2 friends attend.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Case \(n = 2\)**: The program correctly handles this case by printing `2`.
- **General Case**: The program checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, it prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints `3`.

Given the function summary and the program logic, the program correctly identifies whether there is a pair of friends who can attend the party together and ensures that if no such pair exists, all friends must be invited.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment stated that the program incorrectly prints `2` in cases where no pair of friends can attend the party together. However, the program correctly handles these cases by printing `3` when no such pair exists. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final:
**True**
