Reasoning:
- The program should read the number of test cases `t` and then process each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `p` representing the best friends.
- The program constructs a list `v` where `v[i]` is the best friend of the `i-th` friend.
- The logic to check if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is flawed. This condition is checking if the triple indirect reference points back to the original index, which is not the intended logic for this problem.
- The program should find pairs of friends who are best friends with each other and ensure that both in the pair receive invitations. If such pairs exist, only 2 invitations are needed. Otherwise, at least 3 invitations are required.
- The current implementation incorrectly handles the logic and does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations needed.

Correctness: **False**
