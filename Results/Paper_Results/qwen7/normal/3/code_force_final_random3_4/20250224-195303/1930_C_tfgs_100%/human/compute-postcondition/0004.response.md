Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a[0]` is 1 (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` is now 1
   - `n` must still be greater than 0

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
