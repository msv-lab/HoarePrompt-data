Output State: **`cur` is decreased by `adv` plus the value of `counter[a[i+1]]`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv`, `counter[a[i+1]]` is decremented by 1, `adv` is equal to `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` now includes `a[i+1]` appended to it, `j` is 0, `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` appends `a[i - 1] - 0 - 1` to `ans`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is updated by appending `a[i - 1] - 1` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
