Output State: **`cur` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`**.

In this case, the code assigns the value of `n - len(a)` to the variable `cnt`. Since `n` is not defined in the initial state and `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`, `cnt` is calculated based on these values. The other variables remain unchanged.
