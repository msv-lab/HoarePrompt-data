Output State: **`cur` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of unique elements from the original list where each element is `2j + 1` for each index `j`, and `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(set(a))` removes duplicate elements from the list `a`, making it a list of unique elements. Each element in the original list `a` was `2j + 1` for each index `j`. The `cur` and `i` variables remain unchanged. The `counter` variable still holds the count of each element in the new list `a`.
