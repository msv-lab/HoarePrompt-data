To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects mentioned in the loop head. These include the loop variable `_` (which is typically an underscore indicating a throwaway variable) and the value of `cnt`.

Given the information, the loop will execute all its iterations if `cnt` is greater than 0. The initial state before the loop does not provide specific details about the values of `counter`, `ans`, or the list `a`, but these will be modified within the loop body. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `cnt`, ensuring it is greater than 0.

State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0**
