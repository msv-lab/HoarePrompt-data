Output State: **`cur` is decreased by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `adv` is the value of `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `i` is within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `adv` is assigned the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. This value is also subtracted from `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
