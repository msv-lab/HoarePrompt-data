Output State: **`cur` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` and retains the values of the other variables from the initial state.
