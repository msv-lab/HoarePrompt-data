Output State: **`cur` is decreased by `adv`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv`, `adv` must be greater than 0, `i` is within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, and `ans` is a list containing `a[i - 1] - j - 1` where `j` ranges from 0 to `adv-1`, and `ans` now includes `a[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
