Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with the key `x` (the second element of `a`) and its value is 1 more than its previous value (or 1 if it didn't exist), `x` is the second element of `a`, `cnt[x]` is updated to be `cnt.get(x, 0) + 1`**.

This means that the dictionary `cnt` has been updated to increment the count of the key `x` (which is the second element of the list `a`). If `x` was already a key in `cnt`, its value is incremented by 1. If `x` was not a key in `cnt`, it is added with a value of 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
