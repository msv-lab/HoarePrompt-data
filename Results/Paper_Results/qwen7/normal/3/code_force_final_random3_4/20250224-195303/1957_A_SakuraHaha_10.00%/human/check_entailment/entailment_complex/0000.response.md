Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`n`) and their lengths, storing them in a list `a`.
3. It then creates a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
4. The program iterates over the values in `cnt`, calculating the maximum number of complete polygons (with 3 or 4 sides) that can be formed using the sticks.
5. The result is calculated by summing up the integer division of each count by 4 (since a quadrilateral requires 4 sticks of the same length).
6. The program prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem description and the annotated states, the program logic appears to be correct. It handles the constraints and requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
