Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over each element `x` in the list `a`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `x`.

2. **Understand the loop body**: Although the loop body is omitted, we know that `x` is taken from the list `a` in each iteration. The variable `cnt` is being updated based on the value of `x`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is 0
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers
   - `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is `x` (the second element of `a`) and its value is 1 more than its previous value (or 1 if it didn't exist)
   - `x` is the second element of `a`
   - `cnt[x]` is updated to be `cnt.get(x, 0) + 1`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `x` is taken from the list `a` in each iteration, the next value of `x` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - The variable `cnt` will be updated based on this new value of `x`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `a` will lose its first element since `x` is taken from the list in each iteration.
   - `cnt` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.
   - `x` will be the next element in the list `a`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `ans` is still 0.
- `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is still an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` will now be the list without its first element.
- `cnt` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.
- `x` will be the next element in the list `a`.

Since `cnt` is a dictionary and its exact state depends on the values in `a`, we can only say that `cnt` will be updated accordingly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (without its first element), `cnt` is a dictionary updated based on the new value of `x`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`**.
