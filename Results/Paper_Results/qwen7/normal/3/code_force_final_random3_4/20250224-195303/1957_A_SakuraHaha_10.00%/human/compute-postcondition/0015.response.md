Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in cnt.values()`. The variables involved here are `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `ans` is 0 + `x` // 4
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
   - `a` is an empty list
   - `cnt` must have at least one value

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - `x` is taken from `cnt.values()`, so it will change in each iteration.
   - `cnt` is a dictionary, and its values are accessed in the loop. For the loop to continue, `cnt` must still have at least one value.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `cnt` still has at least one value for the loop to continue. The other variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, and `a`) are not directly controlled by the loop and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `cnt` must still have at least one value.

**State: **`ans` is 0 + `x` // 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` must have at least one value**
