Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with the key `x` (the first element of `a`) and its value is 1 more than its previous value (or 1 if it didn't exist), `x` is the first element of `a`**.

Explanation: The code `cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1` increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `x` is the first element of the list `a`, the dictionary `cnt` now contains the key `x` with a value of 1. All other variables remain in their initial states.
