You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the lengths of the sticks a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary containing counts of all unique elements from the original list `a` where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of how many times it appeared in `a`.
    #
    #This final state occurs because after all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will be empty since one element is processed in each iteration. The dictionary `cnt` will contain the counts of each unique element from the original list `a`, reflecting how many times each number appeared in the list.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt` by 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` contains the count of each unique element from the original list `a`, where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of how many times it appeared in `a`.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop, `ans` accumulates the result of dividing each value in the `cnt` dictionary by 4 and summing these results. The list `a` remains empty as one element is processed in each iteration, and `cnt` reflects the counts of each unique element from the original list `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the floor division of each value in cnt by 4)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the number of polygons by simply dividing the count of each stick length by 4. This approach fails to consider the constraints that no stick can be used in more than one polygon and that the number of sides of a polygon must be at least 3.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
5
3 3 3 3 3
```

The expected output is `1` because we can form one equilateral triangle (3 sides). However, the program will output `1` but this is not the correct approach since it does not check if the number of sides of a polygon is at least 3.

To fix this, the program needs to iterate through the counts and ensure that the number of sides of a polygon is at least 3 before counting it towards the total number of polygons. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    
    for x in cnt.values():
        # Ensure the number of sides of a polygon is at least 3
        ans += min(x // 3, x)
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of sides of a polygon is at least 3 and correctly counts the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.
