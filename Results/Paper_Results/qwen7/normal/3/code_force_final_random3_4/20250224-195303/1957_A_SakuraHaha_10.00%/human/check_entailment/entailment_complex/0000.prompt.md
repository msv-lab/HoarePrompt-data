Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

# Annotated Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the lengths of the sticks a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary containing counts of all unique elements from the original list `a` where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of how many times it appeared in `a`.
    #
    #This final state occurs because after all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will be empty since one element is processed in each iteration. The dictionary `cnt` will contain the counts of each unique element from the original list `a`, reflecting how many times each number appeared in the list.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt` by 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` contains the count of each unique element from the original list `a`, where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of how many times it appeared in `a`.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop, `ans` accumulates the result of dividing each value in the `cnt` dictionary by 4 and summing these results. The list `a` remains empty as one element is processed in each iteration, and `cnt` reflects the counts of each unique element from the original list `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the floor division of each value in cnt by 4)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. It then counts the occurrences of each stick length, calculates the sum of the floor division of these counts by 4, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function returns nothing.
