Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a:`. The variables involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the initial state**:
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `cnt` is an empty dictionary.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`.
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element (i.e., `a` must not be an empty list).

4. **Formulate the final state**:
   - We need to ensure that `a` is not an empty list. Since `a` is derived from splitting a string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, we need to ensure that the string contains at least one space-separated integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt` is an empty dictionary**.
