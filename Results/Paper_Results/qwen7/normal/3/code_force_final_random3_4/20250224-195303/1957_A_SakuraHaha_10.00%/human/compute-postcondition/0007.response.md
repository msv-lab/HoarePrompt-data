Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in a:`. The variables involved in this loop are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is 0
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers
   - `cnt` is a dictionary with the key `x` (the first element of `a`) and its value is 1 more than its previous value (or 1 if it didn't exist)
   - `x` is the first element of `a`

3. **Understand what happens inside the loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - For each element `x` in `a`, the variable `x` is set to the current element being processed.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is set to the current element of `a` in each iteration, `x` will be updated to the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `ans` remains 0 because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `ans`.
   - `t` remains unchanged because there is no mention of `t` being modified within the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged because there is no mention of `n` being modified within the loop.
   - `a` remains the same list of integers.
   - `cnt` will be updated based on the new value of `x` (which is the next element in `a`).
   - `x` will be the next element in the list `a`.

Given that `a` is a non-empty list and `x` is the first element of `a` at the end of the previous iteration, the next element in `a` will be the second element. Therefore, `x` will be the second element of `a`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with the key `x` (the second element of `a`) and its value is 1 more than its previous value (or 1 if it didn't exist), `x` is the second element of `a`**
