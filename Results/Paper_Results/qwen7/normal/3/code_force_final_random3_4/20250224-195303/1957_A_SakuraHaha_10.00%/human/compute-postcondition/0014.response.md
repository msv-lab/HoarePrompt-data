Output State: **`ans` is 0 + `x` // 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` must have at least one value**

Explanation: The code `ans += x // 4` updates the value of `ans` by adding the integer division of `x` by 4 to its current value. Since `ans` was initially 0, the new value of `ans` is `0 + x // 4`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
