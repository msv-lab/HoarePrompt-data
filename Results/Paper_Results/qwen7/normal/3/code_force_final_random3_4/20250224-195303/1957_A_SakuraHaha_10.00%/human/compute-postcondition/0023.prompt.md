You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the lengths of the sticks a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary containing counts of all unique elements from the original list `a` where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of how many times it appeared in `a`.
    #
    #This final state occurs because after all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will be empty since one element is processed in each iteration. The dictionary `cnt` will contain the counts of each unique element from the original list `a`, reflecting how many times each number appeared in the list.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt` by 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` contains the count of each unique element from the original list `a`, where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of how many times it appeared in `a`.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop, `ans` accumulates the result of dividing each value in the `cnt` dictionary by 4 and summing these results. The list `a` remains empty as one element is processed in each iteration, and `cnt` reflects the counts of each unique element from the original list `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the floor division of each value in cnt by 4)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
