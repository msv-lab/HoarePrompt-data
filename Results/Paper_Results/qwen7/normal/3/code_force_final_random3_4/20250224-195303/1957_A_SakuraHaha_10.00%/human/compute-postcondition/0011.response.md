Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary containing counts of all unique integers from the original list `a`, where each key is an integer from `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appeared in `a`.

This final state occurs because after all iterations of the loop, the list `a` has been fully processed, and the dictionary `cnt` now holds the frequency count of each unique integer present in the original list `a`. The variables `ans`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
