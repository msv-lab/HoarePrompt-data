Output State: **`i` is 11, `x` is an input integer, `n` is greater than 10, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers using map(int, input().strip().split()), `flag` is True**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the map object to a list. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `flag` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `l` is updated to contain the integers entered by the user.
