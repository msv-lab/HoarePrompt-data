Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n)` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 10
   - `x` is 10 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `n` is the same as before (this variable is part of the loop head, so it needs to be considered)
   - `l` is a list of integers entered by the user (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `flag` is True (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < n` must be true. Since `i` is currently 10, `n` must be greater than 10 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 11), and `n` must still be greater than 10 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 11
- `n` is greater than 10
- `x` remains 10
- `l` remains a list of integers entered by the user
- `flag` remains True

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 11, `x` is 10, `n` is greater than 10, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `flag` is True**
