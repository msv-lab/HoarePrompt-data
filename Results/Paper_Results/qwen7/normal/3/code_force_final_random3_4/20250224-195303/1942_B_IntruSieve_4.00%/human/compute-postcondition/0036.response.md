Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `minn` and `mex` are updated based on the value of `arr[i + 1]`; `mex` is appended with the current value of `minn`.**

This means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `minn` and `mex` are updated based on the value of `arr[i + 1]`. After executing the line `mex.append(minn)`, the list `mex` now includes the current value of `minn`.
