Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given an array \( a \) of length \( n \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
- We need to construct a permutation \( p \) such that the above condition holds true.

### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` processes an array `arr` and calculates a list `mex` based on the values of `minn` and the absolute differences between elements of `arr` and `minn`.
- It then prints each element of `mex` followed by a space, and finally prints a newline character.
- The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the list `mex` based on the input list `arr`.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The function initializes `minn` and `maxx` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array `arr` and constructs the `mex` list.

2. **Processing Each Element:**
   - For each element \( a_i \) in `arr`:
     - If \( a_i > 0 \):
       - Assign `mex[i] = minn`.
       - Increment `minn` by 1.
       - If `minn` equals `maxx`, increment `maxx` by 1.
     - If \( a_i \leq 0 \):
       - Calculate `mex[i] = abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
       - Update `maxx` if necessary.

3. **Output:**
   - Print each element of `mex` followed by a space.
   - Print a newline character.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

#### Expected Output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

#### Program Output:
```
0 1 3 2 4
```

#### Detailed Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **First Element:**
   - \( a_1 = 1 \)
   - MEX of an empty set is 0.
   - \( p_1 = 0 \)
   - `mex[0] = 0`

2. **Second Element:**
   - \( a_2 = 1 \)
   - MEX of \([0]\) is 1.
   - \( p_2 = 1 \)
   - `mex[1] = 1`

3. **Third Element:**
   - \( a_3 = -2 \)
   - MEX of \([0, 1]\) is 2.
   - \( p_3 = 3 \) (since \( 2 - 2 = 0 \), but 0 is already used, so we take the next available number which is 3).
   - `mex[2] = 3`

4. **Fourth Element:**
   - \( a_4 = 1 \)
   - MEX of \([0, 1, 3]\) is 2.
   - \( p_4 = 2 \)
   - `mex[3] = 2`

5. **Fifth Element:**
   - \( a_5 = 2 \)
   - MEX of \([0, 1, 3, 2]\) is 4.
   - \( p_5 = 4 \)
   - `mex[4] = 4`

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the MEX values and assign them to the permutation \( p \). Specifically, the assignment of \( p_3 \) is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this case, making it incorrect.

Final: **False**
