Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `minn` and `mex` will be updated based on the value of `arr[i+1]`, `mex` is appended with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the `mex` list the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. The values of `i`, `n`, `minn`, and `mex` are updated based on the provided conditions. `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `minn` and `mex` are updated based on the new value of `arr[i+1]`, and `mex` is appended with the calculated value.
