To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `mex` is a list containing all the values of `minn` updated during each iteration where `arr[i] > 0`, and the absolute differences between `arr[i]` and `minn` when `arr[i] <= 0`.
   - `itm` is the second element of `mex`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(itm, end=' ')`.

Given this information, we need to focus on the value of `itm`, which is the second element of the list `mex`.

Since the exact content of `mex` is not provided, we can only describe `itm` based on its position in `mex`.

Output: **itm (where itm is the second element of the list mex)**
