Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the state changes within the loop**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration (`i = i + 1`).
   - `n` remains the same throughout the loop.
   - `minn` and `mex` are updated based on the value of `arr[i + 1]`.

Given the conditions for updating `minn` and `mex`:
- If `arr[i] > 0`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1` and `mex` is set to `minn`.
- If `minn` equals `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1` and `mex` is set to `minn`.
- If `arr[i] <= 0`, then `mex` is updated to include the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.
- If the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to this new value.

Since these updates occur inside the loop and we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we focus on the values of `i` and `n`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - The values of `minn` and `mex` are updated based on `arr[i + 1]`, but these changes are internal to the loop and do not affect the loop head variables directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `minn` and `mex` are updated based on the value of `arr[i + 1]`**.
