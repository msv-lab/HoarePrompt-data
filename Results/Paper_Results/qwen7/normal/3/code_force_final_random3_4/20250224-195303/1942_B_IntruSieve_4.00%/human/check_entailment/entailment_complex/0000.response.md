Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \) such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
2. The provided program does not attempt to construct the permutation \( p \). Instead, it calculates a list `mex` which seems to be related to the MEX operation but does not use it to construct the permutation \( p \).
3. The function `func_1()` only processes the input array `arr` and prints a list `mex`, but it does not generate or print the permutation \( p \).

Given the requirements of the problem, the provided code does not meet the criteria because it does not construct the permutation \( p \) as required. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
