Output State: **`arr[i]` is greater than 0; `mex` contains the current minimum value of `minn`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `minn` to the list `mex`. Since `minn` was not defined before this line, we assume it holds some value (let's denote it as `minn_value`). After executing the line `mex.append(minn)`, `mex` now contains this value. The value of `arr[i]` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0.
