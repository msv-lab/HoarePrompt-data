Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mex` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 (and its value is input from the user), `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > 0:
        mex.append(minn)
        minn += 1
        if minn == maxx:
            minn = maxx + 1
    else:
        mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
        if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
            maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `arr[i]` is an integer. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, then `minn` is equal to `maxx` + 1 and `mex` contains the current minimum value of `minn`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, then `mex` is a list containing the value `maxx`, which is the maximum value among all `abs(arr[j] - minn)` for all elements `arr[j]` in the array.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `minn` and `mex` are updated based on the value of `arr[i + 1]`. If `arr[i] > 0`, then `minn` is `maxx + 1` and `mex` is now equal to `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, then `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1` and `mex` is set to `minn`. If `arr[i] <= 0`, then `mex` is appended with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. If the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to this new value. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `minn` is updated based on whether `minn` equals `maxx` or not (either `maxx + 1` or increased by 1), and `mex` is appended with the current value of `minn`. Additionally, `maxx` is the maximum of the absolute differences between `arr[i]` and `minn`, and `arr[i + 1]` and `minn` if `arr[i] > 0`; otherwise, `minn` and `mex` are updated based on the value of `arr[i + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
