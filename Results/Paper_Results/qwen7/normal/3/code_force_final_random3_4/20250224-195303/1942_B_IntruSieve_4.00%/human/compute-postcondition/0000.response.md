Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the value of n is input from the user.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and now `n` holds the value input by the user.
