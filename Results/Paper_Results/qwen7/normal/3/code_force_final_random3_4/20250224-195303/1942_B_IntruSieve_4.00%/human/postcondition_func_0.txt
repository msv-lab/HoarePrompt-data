The function processes a list of integers `arr` and calculates a list `mex` based on the values of `minn` and the absolute differences between elements of `arr` and `minn`. It then prints each element of `mex` followed by a space, and finally prints a newline character. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the list `mex` based on the input list `arr`.
