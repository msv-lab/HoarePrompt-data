Postcondition: `arr[i]` is an integer. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, then `minn` is equal to `maxx` + 1 and `mex` contains the current minimum value of `minn`. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, then `mex` is a list containing the value `maxx`, which is the maximum value among all `abs(arr[j] - minn)` for all elements `arr[j]` in the array.
