You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `arr` and calculates a list `mex` based on the values of `minn` and the absolute differences between elements of `arr` and `minn`. It then prints each element of `mex` followed by a space, and finally prints a newline character. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the list `mex` based on the input list `arr`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \). The value of \( a_i \) is defined as the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) of the prefix \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \) minus \( p_i \).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the smallest and largest values seen so far.
   - The loop iterates through the array \( a \):
     - If \( a_i > 0 \), it means the next value in the permutation \( p \) should be the current `minn`, and then increments `minn`.
     - If \( a_i \leq 0 \), it calculates the MEX value and updates `maxx` if necessary.
   - After processing the array, it prints the reconstructed permutation \( p \).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for constructing \( p \) seems to align with the definition of MEX. Specifically, when \( a_i > 0 \), the next value in \( p \) should be the smallest unused value (`minn`), which ensures the MEX calculation is correct.
   - When \( a_i \leq 0 \), the code correctly adjusts the MEX value and updates `maxx` to ensure the next value in \( p \) is correctly chosen.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles both positive and negative values in \( a \) appropriately.
   - The code ensures that each value from 0 to \( n-1 \) is used exactly once in the permutation \( p \).

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.
