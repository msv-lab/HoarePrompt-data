Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `minn` and `mex` are updated based on the value of `arr[i + 1]`; `mex` is appended with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the `mex` list the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. Since `i` is `i + 1`, `i` has been incremented by 1. `n` remains unchanged, and `minn` and `mex` are updated based on the value of `arr[i + 1]`. The value of `mex` is now modified by appending the calculated value.
