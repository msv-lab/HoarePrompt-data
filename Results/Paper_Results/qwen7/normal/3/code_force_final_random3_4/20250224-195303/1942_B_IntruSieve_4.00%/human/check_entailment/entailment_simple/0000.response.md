Reasoning:

1. The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
2. The annotated program does not actually implement the logic to construct the permutation \( p \). Instead, it calculates and prints the `mex` values, which do not directly help in constructing the permutation \( p \).

The correct approach should involve constructing the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Here's how the solution should work:

1. Initialize an empty permutation list \( p \).
2. Iterate through the array \( a \) and use the value of \( a_i \) to determine the next value in the permutation \( p \).
3. Ensure that the chosen value for \( p_i \) is the smallest non-negative integer not already used in \( p \).

Given the current implementation, it does not follow this logic and instead calculates `mex` values, which is not part of the required solution.

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect because it does not fulfill the requirement of constructing the permutation \( p \).

Correctness: **False**
