Based on the initial state provided:

- `mex` is a list containing all the values of `minn` updated during each iteration where `arr[i] > 0`, and the absolute differences between `arr[i]` and `minn` when `arr[i] <= 0`.
- The final value of `itm` is the last element of `mex`.
- `maxx` is the maximum value among all the absolute differences calculated during the loop.

Given this information, the `print()` statement will simply print an empty line since no specific value or string is being passed to it.

Output: **Output:**
