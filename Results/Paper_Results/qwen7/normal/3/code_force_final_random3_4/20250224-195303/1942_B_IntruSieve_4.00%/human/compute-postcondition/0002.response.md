Output State: **`mex` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the value of `n` is input from the user; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The line `mex = []` initializes an empty list named `mex`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
