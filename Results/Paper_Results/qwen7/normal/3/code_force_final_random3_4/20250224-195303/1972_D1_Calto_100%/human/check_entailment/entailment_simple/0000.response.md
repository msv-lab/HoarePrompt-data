Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: 
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It works as expected, and the state analysis is accurate.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not match the problem requirements. Specifically, the logic inside the loop is incorrect. The variables `x` and `y` do not represent the correct values needed to solve the problem. The calculation of `x` and `y` and their usage in the loop do not align with the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Given the problem statement, the correct approach should involve iterating over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation of `func_2` does not perform this check correctly.

Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not solve the problem as stated. The logic in `func_2` needs to be corrected to properly count the number of valid pairs according to the given conditions.
