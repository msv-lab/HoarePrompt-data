Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` is `n - 10`, `y` is 4**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `n - (i * i - i)`. Given that `i` is 3, `i * i - i` equals `3 * 3 - 3` which is `9 - 3` or `6`. Therefore, `x` is updated to `n - 6`. Since `x` was previously defined as `n - 1`, the new value of `x` is `n - 10`. The values of `cnt`, `i`, and `y` remain unchanged.
