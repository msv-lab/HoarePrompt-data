You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and the function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the gcd of the initial a and b, b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the initial values of a and b, which is a, since b is 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is 20, `i` is 5, `x` is `n - 27`, `y` is 25, `m` must be at least 4.
    #
    #To understand this, let's break it down:
    #
    #- Initially, `cnt` is -1.
    #- After the first iteration (`i` is 2), `cnt` becomes 1.
    #- After the second iteration (`i` is 3), `cnt` becomes 4.
    #- After the third iteration (`i` is 4), `cnt` becomes 10.
    #
    #Each time the loop runs, `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` where `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
    #
    #For the fourth iteration (`i` is 5):
    #- `x` is calculated as `n - (5 * 5 - 5) = n - 20`.
    #- `y` is `5 * 5 = 25`.
    #- The term `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` will add 1 to `cnt` because `x` divided by `y` is less than 1, so `math.ceil(x / y)` is 1, and `x % y` is not zero, so `(x % y == 0)` is 0. Therefore, `cnt` becomes 10 + 1 = 11.
    #
    #For the fifth iteration (`i` is 6):
    #- `x` is calculated as `n - (6 * 6 - 6) = n - 30`.
    #- `y` is `6 * 6 = 36`.
    #- The term `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` will add 1 to `cnt` because `x` divided by `y` is less than 1, so `math.ceil(x / y)` is 1, and `x % y` is not zero, so `(x % y == 0)` is 0. Therefore, `cnt` becomes 11 + 1 = 12.
    #
    #Continuing this pattern, we can see that each iteration adds 1 to `cnt`. Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `m`, and we know `m` must be at least 4, the total number of iterations is `m`. Given the pattern, after `m` iterations, `cnt` will be `-1 + m`. If `m` is 4, then `cnt` would be `-1 + 4 = 3`. However, based on the provided information, the correct value for `m` is at least 4, leading us to conclude that after all iterations, `cnt` will be 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25.
    return cnt
    #The program returns 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the program includes two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) but does not use them to solve the problem. Instead, `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is not used in the main logic, and `func_2` seems to implement a different logic that does not address the problem statement.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

- The valid pairs should be \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\).
- The output should be 3.

However, running the provided program with these inputs will not produce the correct result because the logic inside `func_2` does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
