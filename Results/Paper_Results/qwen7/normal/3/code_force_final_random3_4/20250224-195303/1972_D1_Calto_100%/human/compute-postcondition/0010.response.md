Output State: **`cnt` is 4, `i` is 4, `x` is `n - 18`, `y` is 9, `m` must be at least 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `n - (i * i - i)`. Given that `i` is 4, `i * i - i` equals `16 - 4`, which is 12. So, `x` becomes `n - 12`. Since `n` is not specified, `x` is expressed as `n - 12`. The values of `cnt`, `i`, `y`, and `m` remain unchanged.
