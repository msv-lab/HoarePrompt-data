Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` is `n - 10`, `y` is 9**

Explanation: The code `y = i * i` assigns the value of `i * i` (which is 3 * 3) to `y`. Since `i` is 3, `y` becomes 9. The values of `cnt`, `i`, `x`, and `y` are updated accordingly. The initial value of `x` is given as `n - 10`, and it remains unchanged.
