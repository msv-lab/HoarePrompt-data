Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the program includes two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) but does not use them to solve the problem. Instead, `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is not used in the main logic, and `func_2` seems to implement a different logic that does not address the problem statement.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

- The valid pairs should be \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\).
- The output should be 3.

However, running the provided program with these inputs will not produce the correct result because the logic inside `func_2` does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
