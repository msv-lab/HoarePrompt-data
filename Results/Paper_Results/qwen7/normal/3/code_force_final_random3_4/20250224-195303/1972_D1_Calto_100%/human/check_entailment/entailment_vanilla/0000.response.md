Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
   - The condition is that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\). This function is correct because it uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is a well-known and efficient method for computing GCD.
   - `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. However, let's examine this function closely.

3. **Analyzing `func_2(n, m)`:**
   - The function iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then increments the count `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

### Issues with `func_2(n, m)`:

- **Incorrect Calculation:**
  - The expressions \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) do not seem to have any relation to the problem statement.
  - The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- **No Implementation of the Condition:**
  - The function does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for any pair \((a, b)\).
  - Instead, it seems to be trying to count something else, possibly related to quadratic residues or some other unrelated computation.

### Conclusion:

The provided function `func_2(n, m)` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
