Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

# Annotated Functions:

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and the function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the gcd of the initial a and b, b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the initial values of a and b, which is a, since b is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the loop terminates when `b` becomes 0, the function returns the gcd of the initial values of `a` and `b`, which is the value of `a`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is 20, `i` is 5, `x` is `n - 27`, `y` is 25, `m` must be at least 4.
    #
    #To understand this, let's break it down:
    #
    #- Initially, `cnt` is -1.
    #- After the first iteration (`i` is 2), `cnt` becomes 1.
    #- After the second iteration (`i` is 3), `cnt` becomes 4.
    #- After the third iteration (`i` is 4), `cnt` becomes 10.
    #
    #Each time the loop runs, `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` where `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
    #
    #For the fourth iteration (`i` is 5):
    #- `x` is calculated as `n - (5 * 5 - 5) = n - 20`.
    #- `y` is `5 * 5 = 25`.
    #- The term `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` will add 1 to `cnt` because `x` divided by `y` is less than 1, so `math.ceil(x / y)` is 1, and `x % y` is not zero, so `(x % y == 0)` is 0. Therefore, `cnt` becomes 10 + 1 = 11.
    #
    #For the fifth iteration (`i` is 6):
    #- `x` is calculated as `n - (6 * 6 - 6) = n - 30`.
    #- `y` is `6 * 6 = 36`.
    #- The term `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` will add 1 to `cnt` because `x` divided by `y` is less than 1, so `math.ceil(x / y)` is 1, and `x % y` is not zero, so `(x % y == 0)` is 0. Therefore, `cnt` becomes 11 + 1 = 12.
    #
    #Continuing this pattern, we can see that each iteration adds 1 to `cnt`. Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `m`, and we know `m` must be at least 4, the total number of iterations is `m`. Given the pattern, after `m` iterations, `cnt` will be `-1 + m`. If `m` is 4, then `cnt` would be `-1 + 4 = 3`. However, based on the provided information, the correct value for `m` is at least 4, leading us to conclude that after all iterations, `cnt` will be 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25.
    return cnt
    #The program returns 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers with the constraint 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It iterates from `i = 1` to `m`, updating a counter `cnt` based on the values of `x` and `y` derived from `n` and `i`. After completing the iterations, the function returns 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25.
