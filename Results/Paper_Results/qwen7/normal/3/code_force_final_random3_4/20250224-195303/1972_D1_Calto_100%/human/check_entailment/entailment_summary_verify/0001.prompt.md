You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers with the constraint 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It iterates from `i = 1` to `m`, updating a counter `cnt` based on the values of `x` and `y` derived from `n` and `i`. After completing the iterations, the function returns 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
   - The condition is that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\). This function is correct because it uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is a well-known and efficient method for computing GCD.
   - `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. However, let's examine this function closely.

3. **Analyzing `func_2(n, m)`:**
   - The function iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then increments the count `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

### Issues with `func_2(n, m)`:

- **Incorrect Calculation:**
  - The expressions \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) do not seem to have any relation to the problem statement.
  - The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- **No Implementation of the Condition:**
  - The function does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for any pair \((a, b)\).
  - Instead, it seems to be trying to count something else, possibly related to quadratic residues or some other unrelated computation.

### Conclusion:

The provided function `func_2(n, m)` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
