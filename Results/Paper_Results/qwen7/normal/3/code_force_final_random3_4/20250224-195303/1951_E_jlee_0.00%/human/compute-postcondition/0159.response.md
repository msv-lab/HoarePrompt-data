Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is 2.
   - `done` is set to `True`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The expression `string[:j - 1]` means we need to take a substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`.
   - Since `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0. So, `string[:j - 1]` translates to `string[:0]`, which is an empty string (`""`).
   - The expression `string[j - 1:]` means we need to take a substring starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.
   - Again, since `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0. So, `string[j - 1:]` translates to `string[0:]`, which is the entire string `string`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output two parts: an empty string followed by the entire string `string`.

Given this analysis, the output will be:
Output: **'', string**
