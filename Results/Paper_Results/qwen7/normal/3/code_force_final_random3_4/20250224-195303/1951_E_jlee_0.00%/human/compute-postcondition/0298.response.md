Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 2
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`
- `done` is True
- `count` is 2
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

Given that `j` is 2, we know that `string[:j]` will slice the string from the beginning up to (but not including) the index 2, and `string[j:]` will slice the string starting from index 2 to the end.

Since no specific value for `string` is provided, we can only describe it in terms of its slices based on the value of `j`.

Output: **string[:2], string[2:]**
