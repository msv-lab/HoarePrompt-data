Postcondition: `j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, `count` is either unchanged if `count2` is greater than `count`, or set to 3 if `count2` is between 0 and `count` (exclusive), and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
