Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 4
- `n` is at least 7
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count` is 4
- `done` is set to True
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

We need to determine what will be printed with the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

Given:
- `j` is 4
- We do not have the explicit value of `string`, but we know it must be long enough to include up to index `j` and beyond.

Since `j` is 4, the slice `string[:j]` will take the substring from the start of `string` up to (but not including) index 4. The slice `string[j:]` will take the substring starting from index 4 to the end of `string`.

Output: **string[:4], string[4:]**
