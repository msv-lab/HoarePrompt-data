Given the initial state:

- `j` is 3
- `n` is at least 7
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count` is greater than 0
- `done` is set to `True`
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken out
- `count2` is greater than `count`
- `count2` is not equal to `count`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `j` is 3.
- `string` is not explicitly defined, but we need to assume it is a string for the slicing operation to make sense.

The slicing operation `string[:j]` will take the substring from the start of the string up to but not including the index `j`. Since `j` is 3, `string[:j]` will give us the substring from the beginning of `string` to the third character.

The slicing operation `string[j:]` will take the substring starting from index `j` to the end of the string. Since `j` is 3, `string[j:]` will give us the substring from the fourth character to the end of the string.

Therefore, the print statement will output these two substrings separated by a comma.

Output: **string[:3], string[3:]**
