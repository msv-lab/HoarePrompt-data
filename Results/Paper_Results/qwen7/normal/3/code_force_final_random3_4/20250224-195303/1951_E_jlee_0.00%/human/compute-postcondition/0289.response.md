Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- `done` is True.
- `count` is 2.
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

We need to focus on the `print` statement:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

Given `j` is 2, we can substitute this value into the slicing expressions:
- `string[:j - 1]` becomes `string[:2 - 1]` which simplifies to `string[:1]`.
- `string[j - 1:]` becomes `string[2 - 1:]` which simplifies to `string[1:]`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the first character, followed by the substring starting from the second character to the end of `string`.

Output: **string[0], string[1:]**
