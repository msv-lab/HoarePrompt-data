Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is 3, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is 4, `x` is `s[0]`, and `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 3, `n` is at least 7, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is greater than 0, `done` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, then `count2` is either equal to `count` if `count` is greater than 1, or `count2` is greater than `count` or not equal to `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 4, `n` is at least 7, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is either 4 or 5, `done` is set to True, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or continue to the next iteration of the loop with `count2` set to 0. If `count2` equals `count` or is greater than or equal to `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 4, `n` is greater than 7, and `count` is 4. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
