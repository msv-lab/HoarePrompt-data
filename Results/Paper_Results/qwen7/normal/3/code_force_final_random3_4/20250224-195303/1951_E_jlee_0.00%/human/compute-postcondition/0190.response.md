Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `count` is 1, `count2` is 1, `i` is 2, `t` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` assigns the length of the list `s` to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, the length of `s` is now stored in `n`.
