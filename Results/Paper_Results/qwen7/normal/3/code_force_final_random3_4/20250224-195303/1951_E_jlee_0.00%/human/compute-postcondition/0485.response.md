Output State: **`j` is 4; `n` is greater than 7; `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `j`, `n`, or `done`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code, the variables retain their initial states, and the break statement indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or conditional we were in.
