Output: **string (where string is a variable whose value is not provided in the initial state)**

Explanation: The initial state provides the value of `j` as 4 and mentions that `n` is greater than 7. However, it does not provide any information about the value of the `string` variable. Therefore, the print statement will simply output the value of `string`, which remains unspecified based on the given information.
