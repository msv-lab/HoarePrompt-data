Given the initial state:
- `j` is 3
- `n` must be at least 7
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(string)` is executed. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `j = 3`
- Since `n` must be at least 7, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 7.
- Therefore, `n - 1 - j = 7 - 1 - 3 = 3`.

So, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[3]`. This means `s[3]` is not equal to itself, which is a contradiction unless `s[3]` is a mutable object (like a list or dictionary) and its value changes between the time it is assigned and the time it is compared. However, if `s` is a simple list of immutable values (like strings or numbers), this condition cannot be true because an element cannot be different from itself.

Since the problem does not provide more context about the nature of `s` or how the condition is checked, and assuming `s` is a list of immutable values, the condition `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]` would never hold true under normal circumstances.

Therefore, the `string` variable to be printed is not explicitly defined or provided in the initial state, and the condition described seems contradictory.

Output: **The output is undefined due to the contradictory condition.**
