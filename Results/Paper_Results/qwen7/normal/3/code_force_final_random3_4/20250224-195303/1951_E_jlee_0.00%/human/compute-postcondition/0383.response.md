Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is 4, `x` is `s[0]`, and `count2` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `count2 = 0` initializes `count2` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `j`, `n`, `s[j]`, `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done`, `count`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
