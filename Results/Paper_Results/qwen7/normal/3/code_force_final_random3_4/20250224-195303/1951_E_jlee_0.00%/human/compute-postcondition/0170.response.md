Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 2, `done` is set to True.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or switch case. Since no loop or switch case was specified in the initial state or the code snippet, the values of `j`, `n`, and `done` remain unchanged.
