Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
   - `done` is True.
   - `count` is either unchanged if `count2` is greater than `count`, or set to 3 if `count2` is between 0 and `count` (exclusive).

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(string)`, but there is no definition or initialization of the variable `string` in the given initial state.

Given the information, we can infer that the variable `string` is not defined or initialized in the provided initial state. Therefore, the print statement will likely result in a NameError or an error message indicating that `string` is not defined.

Output: **NameError: name 'string' is not defined**
