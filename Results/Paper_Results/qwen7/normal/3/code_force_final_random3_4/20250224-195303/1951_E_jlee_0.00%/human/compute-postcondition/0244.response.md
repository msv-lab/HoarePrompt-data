Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`
- `done` is True
- `count` is greater than 1
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count2` is equal to `count`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`.

Let's break it down:

1. `j` is 1.
2. Since `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0.
3. Therefore, `string[:j - 1]` is equivalent to `string[:0]`, which is an empty string (`""`).
4. `string[j - 1:]` is equivalent to `string[0:]`, which is the entire string `string`.

Given this, the print statement will output the concatenation of an empty string and the entire string `string`.

Output: **"" string**
