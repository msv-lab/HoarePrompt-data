Postcondition: `j` is 4, `n` is at least 7, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is 4, `done` is set to True, and if `count2` equals `count`, we either break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or continue to the next iteration of the loop with `count2` set to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
