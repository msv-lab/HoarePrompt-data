Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is 2, `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, `done` is set to True, `count` is greater than 0, and the current value of `s[j]` equals `x`. If `count2` is greater than 0 but less than `count`, `count2` is set to `count`. Otherwise, `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, and if `count` is greater than 1, `count2` equals `count`; if `count` is not greater than 1, `count2` is greater than `count`.
