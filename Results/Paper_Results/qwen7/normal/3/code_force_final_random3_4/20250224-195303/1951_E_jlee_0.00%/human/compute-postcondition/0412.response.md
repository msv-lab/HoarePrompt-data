Output: **string[:2], string[3:]** (where `string[:2]` represents the substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the character at index 2, and `string[3:]` represents the substring starting from the character at index 3 to the end of `string`). 

Explanation:
- `j` is explicitly given as 3.
- Since `j` is 3, `string[:j - 1]` evaluates to `string[:2]`, which means it includes characters from the start of `string` up to but not including the character at index 2.
- Similarly, `string[j - 1:]` evaluates to `string[3:]`, which means it includes characters starting from the character at index 3 to the end of `string`.

Given the explicit value of `j` and the general form of slicing in Python, the output is determined directly from these values.
