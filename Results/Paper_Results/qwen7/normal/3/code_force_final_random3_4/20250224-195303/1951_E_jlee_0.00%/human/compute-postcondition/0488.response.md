Output State: **`j` is 4, `n` is greater than 7, `count` is 4**.

Explanation: The variable `count` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 4. The conditions involving `done`, `s[j]`, and `s[n - 1 - j]` are not affected by this line of code, so the postconditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `j` is still 4, `n` is still greater than 7, and `count` is now 4.
