Postcondition: `j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and `count` is 3. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `count2` is initialized to 0. Otherwise, `count2` remains unchanged and does not exceed `count`.
