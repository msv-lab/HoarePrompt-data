Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 4
- `n` is greater than 7
- `count` is 4
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, the postcondition remains unchanged.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`.

1. `j` is 4, so `string[:j - 1]` will be `string[:3]`.
2. `string[j - 1:]` will be `string[3:]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the 4th character, followed by the substring starting from the 4th character to the end of `string`.

Output: **string[:3], string[3:]**
