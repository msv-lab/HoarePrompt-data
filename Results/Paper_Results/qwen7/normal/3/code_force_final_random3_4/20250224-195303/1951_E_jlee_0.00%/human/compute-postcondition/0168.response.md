Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1
- `n` is 2
- `done` is set to True

We need to determine the values of `string[:j]` and `string[j:]` when the print statement executes. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `string`. Since the value of `string` is not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact printed output. But we can describe it in terms of the substring of `string`.

Given `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`. And `string[j:]` will be the substring starting from the second character of `string`.

Output: **string[0], string[1:]**
