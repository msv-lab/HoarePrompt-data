Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.
- `done` is True.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is an integer with a value greater than 0 and less than `count`.

The `print(string[:j], string[j:])` statement will print two substrings of the string `string`:
- The first substring is from the beginning of `string` up to but not including the character at index `j`.
- The second substring is from the character at index `j` to the end of `string`.

Given that `j` is 1, the first substring will be an empty string (`""`), and the second substring will be the entire string `string` starting from the first character.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **"" [string]**
