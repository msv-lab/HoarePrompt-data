Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`. The print statement simply outputs the integer 1, and does not depend on the values of `j`, `n`, or the contents of the list `s`. Therefore, the output is **1**.
