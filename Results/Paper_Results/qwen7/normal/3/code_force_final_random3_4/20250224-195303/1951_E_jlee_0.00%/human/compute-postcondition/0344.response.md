Postcondition: `j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, and `count` is 3. If `count2` equals `count`, then `count2` is not greater than `count` (no change in `count`), or `count` is set to 3 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count2` does not equal `count`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count` remains 3.
