Output State: **`j` is 4, `n` is at least 7, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is 4, `done` is set to True, `count2` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one. Since no variables are modified by this statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
