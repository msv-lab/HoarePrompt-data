Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is False, `count` is 3, `count2` is 0, `i` is 4, `x` is `s[0]`, and we continue the loop if `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the conditions for the loop continue to hold true (as specified by the initial state and the condition `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`), the values of all variables remain unchanged.
