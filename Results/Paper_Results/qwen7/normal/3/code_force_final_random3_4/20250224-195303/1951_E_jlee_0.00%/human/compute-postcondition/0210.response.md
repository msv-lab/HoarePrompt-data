Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `count` is 1, `count2` is 1, `i` is 2, `t` is 2, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the only effect of the `continue` statement is to continue the loop without executing any further code in the current iteration.
