Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must not be a power of 2, `f` must be such that `(f - 2) & (f - 2 - 1) != 0`, `l` is a binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2, `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `p = len(l)` calculates the length of the string `l` and assigns it to `p`. Since `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` will be the number of bits in the binary representation of `f`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
