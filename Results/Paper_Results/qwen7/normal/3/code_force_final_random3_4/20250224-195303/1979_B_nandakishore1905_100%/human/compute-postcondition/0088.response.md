Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is \(|n - m|\), `f` is now \(k - 2^p - 2^{(p - 1)} - 2^{(p - 1)}\), `l` is a binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).**

Explanation: The code subtracts `q` (which is \(2^{(p - 1)}\)) from `f`. Therefore, `f` is updated to \(k - 2^p - 2^{(p - 1)} - 2^{(p - 1)}\). All other variables remain unchanged.
