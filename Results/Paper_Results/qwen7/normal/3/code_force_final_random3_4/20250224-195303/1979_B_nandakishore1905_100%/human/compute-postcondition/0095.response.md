Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the total number of test cases minus one, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, `f` is 0, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2. Otherwise, `f` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k - 2^p - 3 \cdot 2^{(p - 1)}\), `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).

This final state indicates that after processing all test cases, for each test case, if the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m` is a power of 2, the output is `k`. Otherwise, it outputs the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k - 2^p - 3 \cdot 2^{(p - 1)}`, where `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
