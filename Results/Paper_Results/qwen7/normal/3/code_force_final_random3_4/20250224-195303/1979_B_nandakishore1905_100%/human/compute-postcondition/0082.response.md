Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is \(|n - m|\), `f` is now \(k - 2^p\) and must not be a power of 2, `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is calculated as \(2^{(p - 1)}\).**

Explanation: The code `q = 2 ** (p - 1)` calculates the value of `q` as \(2^{(p - 1)}\). The value of `p` remains unchanged, which is the length of the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
