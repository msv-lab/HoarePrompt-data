Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `f` is 0.
- `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
- `p` is the length of `l`.
- `q` is 2.
- `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
