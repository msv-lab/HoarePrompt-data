Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `f` is 0.
- `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
- `p` is the length of `l`.
- `q` is 2.
- `k` is updated to the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer 1. The values of other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `f`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and the updated `k`) do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **1**
