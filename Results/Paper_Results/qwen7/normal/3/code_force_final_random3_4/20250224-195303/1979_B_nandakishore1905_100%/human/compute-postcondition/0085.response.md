Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is \(|n - m|\), `f` is now \(k - 2^p - 2^{(p - 1)}\) and `f` must not be a power of 2, `l` is a binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `f` into its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
