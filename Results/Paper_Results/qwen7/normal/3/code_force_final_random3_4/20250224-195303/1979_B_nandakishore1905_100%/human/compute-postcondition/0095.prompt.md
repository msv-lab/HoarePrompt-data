Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    k = abs(n - m)
    if k & k - 1 == 0:
        print(k)
    elif k % 2 != 0:
        print(1)
    else:
        l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
        p = len(l)
        q = 2 ** (p - 1)
        f = k - q
        while f & f - 1 != 0:
            l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            f = f - q
        print(f)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, `k & (k - 1)` equals 0. Otherwise, `k` is neither a power of 2, `k` is either odd or even, `f` is 0, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `f` is 0, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2. If `k` is a power of 2 (i.e., `k & k - 1 == 0`), then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `f` will eventually become 0 after the loop executes all iterations, `l` will be '0', and `p` will be 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, `f` is 0, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2. Otherwise, `f` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k - 2^p - 3 \cdot 2^{(p - 1)}\), `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
