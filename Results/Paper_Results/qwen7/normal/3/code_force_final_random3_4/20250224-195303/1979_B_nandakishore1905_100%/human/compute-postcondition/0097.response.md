Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference \(k\) between \(n\) and \(m\). If \(k\) is a power of 2, it prints \(k\). Otherwise, it finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k - 2^p - 3 \cdot 2^{(p - 1)}\), where \(p\) is the length of the binary representation of \(k\), and prints that value. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case.**
