You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

    2 1 3 4 2 4

    5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
    
    1
    
    1000000000

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        e = set(l)
        m = len(l)
        if 1 in l:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of stone piles. For each test case, it reads the number of piles and the number of stones in each pile. It then determines whether the number 1 is present in the list of stones for any pile. If 1 is found, it outputs 'Bob'; otherwise, it outputs 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic. Specifically, it does not consider the XOR-sum strategy for determining the winner, which is a key aspect of this game. The program checks if there is at least one pile with 1 stone and concludes that Bob wins if such a pile exists. However, this is not always correct.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2
2 2
2
2 3
3
1 2 2
```

- For the first test case (2 2), Alice can remove 1 stone from each pile, leaving both piles with 1 stone. Now, Bob has no valid move (since removing 1 stone would leave a pile with 0 stones), so Alice wins.
- For the second test case (2 3), Alice can remove 1 stone from each pile, leaving the piles as 1 and 2. Now, Bob can remove 1 stone from the pile with 2 stones, leaving both piles with 1 stone. Again, Alice has no valid move, so Bob wins.
- For the third test case (1 2 2), Alice can remove 1 stone from the pile with 1 stone, making all piles have 1 stone. Now, Bob has no valid move, so Alice wins.

The program incorrectly prints "Bob" for the first and third test cases because it only checks for the presence of a pile with 1 stone without considering the overall XOR-sum of the pile sizes. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
