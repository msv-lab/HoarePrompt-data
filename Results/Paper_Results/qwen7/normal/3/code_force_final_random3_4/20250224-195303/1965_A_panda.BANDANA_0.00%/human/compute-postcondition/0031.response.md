Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each of the n piles for multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, followed by integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The function returns information about the distribution of stones across the piles for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing and return value details are not specified in the given output cases, so the description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
