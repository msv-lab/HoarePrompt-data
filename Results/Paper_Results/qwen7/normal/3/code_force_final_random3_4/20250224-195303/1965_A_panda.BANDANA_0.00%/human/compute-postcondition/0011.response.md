Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. If the list `l` contains the value 1, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`; `m` is the length of the list `l`. If the list `l` does not contain the value 1, `e` is still a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, and 1 is not in the list `l`.
