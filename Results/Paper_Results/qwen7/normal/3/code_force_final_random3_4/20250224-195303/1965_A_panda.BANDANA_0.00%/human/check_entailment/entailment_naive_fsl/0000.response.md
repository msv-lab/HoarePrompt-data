Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic. Specifically, it does not consider the XOR-sum strategy for determining the winner, which is a key aspect of this game. The program checks if there is at least one pile with 1 stone and concludes that Bob wins if such a pile exists. However, this is not always correct.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2
2 2
2
2 3
3
1 2 2
```

- For the first test case (2 2), Alice can remove 1 stone from each pile, leaving both piles with 1 stone. Now, Bob has no valid move (since removing 1 stone would leave a pile with 0 stones), so Alice wins.
- For the second test case (2 3), Alice can remove 1 stone from each pile, leaving the piles as 1 and 2. Now, Bob can remove 1 stone from the pile with 2 stones, leaving both piles with 1 stone. Again, Alice has no valid move, so Bob wins.
- For the third test case (1 2 2), Alice can remove 1 stone from the pile with 1 stone, making all piles have 1 stone. Now, Bob has no valid move, so Alice wins.

The program incorrectly prints "Bob" for the first and third test cases because it only checks for the presence of a pile with 1 stone without considering the overall XOR-sum of the pile sizes. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
