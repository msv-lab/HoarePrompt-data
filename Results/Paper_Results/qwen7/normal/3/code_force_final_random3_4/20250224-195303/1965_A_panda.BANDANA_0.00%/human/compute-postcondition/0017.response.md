Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `m` is the length of the list `l`.**

The code `m = len(l)` calculates the length of the list `l` and assigns it to the variable `m`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
