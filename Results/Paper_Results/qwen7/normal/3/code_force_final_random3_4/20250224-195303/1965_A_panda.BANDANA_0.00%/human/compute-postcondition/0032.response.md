Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of stone piles. For each test case, it reads the number of piles and the number of stones in each pile. It then determines whether the number 1 is present in the list of stones for any pile. If 1 is found, it outputs 'Bob'; otherwise, it outputs 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
