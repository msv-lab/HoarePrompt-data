Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list `l` by splitting the input string using `split()` and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The original values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
