Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is `a + b + c` // 3, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by adding `a + (b + c) // 3` to its current value. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are obtained from the input split, their values are not specified here, but the operation to update `k` is clear. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.
