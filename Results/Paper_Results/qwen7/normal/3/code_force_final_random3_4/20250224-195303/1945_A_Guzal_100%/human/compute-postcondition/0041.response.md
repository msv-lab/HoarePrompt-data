Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case contains three integers: the number of introverts (a), the number of extroverts (b), and the number of universals (c). The function returns the result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

However, since the function signature does not show any parameters being passed directly to `func`, and the description only specifies the constraints and expected behavior for the inputs, the direct parameters accepted by the function are implied to be within the scope of the test cases it processes.
