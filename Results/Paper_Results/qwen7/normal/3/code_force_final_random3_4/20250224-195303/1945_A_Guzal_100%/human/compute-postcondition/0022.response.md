Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by adding the value of `a` to the integer division of `(b + c)` by 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
