Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, `k` is either `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` or remains 0 depending on whether `b` is not divisible by 3 and `b % 3 + c` is less than 3. If `b` is not divisible by 3 and `b % 3 + c` is less than 3, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is adjusted such that `(b + c) % 3` is not 0, and `k` is updated accordingly.
