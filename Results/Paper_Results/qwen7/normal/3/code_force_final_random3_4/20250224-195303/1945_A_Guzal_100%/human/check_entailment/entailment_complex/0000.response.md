Reasoning:
1. **Condition Analysis**: The program checks if the number of extroverts (`b`) modulo 3 is not zero and if adding the remainder to the number of universals (`c`) results in less than 3. If this condition is true, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts with the remaining participants.
2. **Tent Calculation**: Otherwise, the program calculates the number of tents required by adding the number of introverts (`a`) and the ceiling of `(b + c) / 3`. This accounts for the fact that each extrovert needs a tent with at least two others, and universals can fit into any configuration.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly by ensuring that the number of tents is calculated appropriately even when the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated number of tents for each test case and handles multiple test cases as specified.

Given the analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required under the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
