Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `k` is `a + b + c` // 3 + 1. This is because if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, then `i` is set to 3 and `k` is adjusted to `a + b + c` // 3 + 1. There is no change in `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` in the else part since it does not exist.
