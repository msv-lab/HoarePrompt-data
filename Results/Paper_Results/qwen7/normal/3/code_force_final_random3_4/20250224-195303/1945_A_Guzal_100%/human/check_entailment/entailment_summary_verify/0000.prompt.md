You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing the counts of introverts (a), extroverts (b), and universals (c). For each test case, it calculates a value `k` based on specific conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `c`. If certain conditions are not met, `k` is incremented by `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`; otherwise, it only includes `a + (b + c) // 3`. The function outputs `k` for each test case and returns the cumulative sum of all `k` values after processing all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to account for the exact placement of extroverts and universals when there are leftover extroverts after forming complete tents. Let's consider the following case:

- Input: `1 1 1` (1 introvert, 1 extrovert, 1 universal)

According to the problem description:
- The introvert needs a tent alone, so 1 tent is used.
- The extrovert needs a tent with two others, and since there is 1 universal, they can share a tent together.
- Therefore, only 2 tents are needed in total.

However, the program logic does not correctly handle this scenario. Here’s the breakdown of the program’s logic for the given input:

```python
(a, b, c) = (1, 1, 1)
k = 0
if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:
    print(-1)
else:
    k += a + (b + c) // 3
    if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
        k += 1
print(k)
```

- `b % 3 != 0` evaluates to `True` because `1 % 3 != 0`.
- `b % 3 + c < 3` evaluates to `True` because `1 % 3 + 1 < 3` (i.e., `1 + 1 < 3`).
- Therefore, the condition inside the `if` block is met, and the program prints `-1`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that extroverts and universals are correctly paired and placed in tents. A more accurate approach would involve checking if there are enough universals to pair with extroverts and adjusting the tent count accordingly.
