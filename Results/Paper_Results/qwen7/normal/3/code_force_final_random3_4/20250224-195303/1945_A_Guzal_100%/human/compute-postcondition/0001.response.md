State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will start with `i = 0` and continue until `i < n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it must be 0). The value of `t` is not directly related to the loop's execution and can remain as given.
