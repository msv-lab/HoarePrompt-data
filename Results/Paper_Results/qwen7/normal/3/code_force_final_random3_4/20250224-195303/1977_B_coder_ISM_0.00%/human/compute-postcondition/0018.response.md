Output State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, and `s` is ['1', '1'].**

Explanation: The initial state is `i` is 2, `length` is 30, and `s` is either ['1'] if the bitwise AND of `x` and \(2^1\) is greater than 0, or ['0'] otherwise. The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since the initial value of `s` is either ['1'] or ['0'], after appending `'1'`, `s` becomes ['1', '1']. The values of `i` and `length` remain unchanged.
