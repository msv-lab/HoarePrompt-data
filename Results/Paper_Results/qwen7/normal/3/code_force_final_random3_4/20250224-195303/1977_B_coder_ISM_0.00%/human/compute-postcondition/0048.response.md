Output State: **`flag` is an integer, `i` is 29, the character at index `i` of string `s` is '-1'.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` sets the character at index `i` of string `s` to '-1'. Since `i` is 29, the character at index 29 of string `s` is now '-1'. The value of `flag` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` also remains unchanged.
