Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(30)`. This means the variable `i` is being iterated over from 0 to 29.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `30` is 30 (This seems to be a constant value and does not change within the loop)
   - `s` is a list (This list could contain elements based on the loop's condition)

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than 30.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Since the loop starts at 0 and goes up to 29, the next value of `i` will be 1.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The variable `i` will be updated to 1.
   - The variable `30` remains unchanged.
   - The list `s` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are specified.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `30` is 30, and `s` is a list**.
