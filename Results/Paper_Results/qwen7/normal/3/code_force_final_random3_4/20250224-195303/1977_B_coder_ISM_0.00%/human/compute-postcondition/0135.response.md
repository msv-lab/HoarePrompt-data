Output State: **`i` is between 0 and 27, `30` is 30, `s` is a list of length 30 with each element being either '1' or '0' based on the binary representation of `x`, `flag` remains 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '-1', the current value of `s[i + 1]` is '1'**.

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[i]` from '1' to '-1'. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
