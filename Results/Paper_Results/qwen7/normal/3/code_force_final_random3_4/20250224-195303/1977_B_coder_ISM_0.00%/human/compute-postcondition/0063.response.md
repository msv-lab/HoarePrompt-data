Output State: **`flag` is an integer, `i` is 29, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0'.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '0'` changes the character at index `i` of string `s` to '0'. Since the initial condition states that the character at index `i` of string `s` is either '0' or '1', and the code sets it to '0', the new state of the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0'. The values of `flag` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
