Postcondition: `flag` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', and either the character at index `i+1` is not '1' or `s[i+1]` does not exist. If `flag` is 1, the character at index `i` of string `s` is changed to '0', and either the character at index `i+1` is not '1' or `s[i+1]` does not exist.
