Output State: **`i` is 0, `30` is 30, `s` is a list containing '0', and `(x & pow(2, i))` is False**

Explanation: The code `s.append('0')` appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` is an empty list. After appending `'0'`, `s` contains the element `'0'`. The values of `i` and `30` remain unchanged, and the condition `(x & pow(2, i))` remains False.
