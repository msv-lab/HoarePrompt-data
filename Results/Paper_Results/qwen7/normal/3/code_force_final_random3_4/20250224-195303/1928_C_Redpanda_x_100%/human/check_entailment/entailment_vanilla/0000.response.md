### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to determine how many values of \( k \) fit the given constraints for each test case.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - Vasya's position in the line is \( n \), and the number he received is \( x \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern is periodic with a period of \( 2k-2 \).
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), we need to find all possible \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) and the settling pattern fits.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions**:
   - `func_1(n)` is intended to find the factors of \( n \).
   - `generate(k)` is intended to generate all possible products of the prime factors raised to various powers.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided functions do not directly solve the problem. They are meant to find the prime factors and their powers, but they are not used correctly to solve the problem at hand.
   - The logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values from the factors is missing.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to determine the period \( 2k-2 \) that fits within the range \( 1 \leq x < n \).
   - We need to check if \( n \mod (2k-2) \) results in \( x \).
   - We need to iterate over possible values of \( k \) and count those that satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
