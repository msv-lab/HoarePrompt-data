Output State: **`factor` is 2, `factor` is yielded.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor` yields the current value of the `factor` variable, which is 2. After yielding, the value of `factor` remains unchanged at 2. Therefore, the output state includes the fact that `factor` is 2 and that it has been yielded.
