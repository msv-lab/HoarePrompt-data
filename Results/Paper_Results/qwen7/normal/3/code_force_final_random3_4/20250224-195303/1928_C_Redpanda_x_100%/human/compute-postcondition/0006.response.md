Output State: **`prime` is the k-th prime number in the list of primes, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, and k is not equal to the length of the list of primes; `rest` is a list of k + 1 elements, `prime_to_i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `prime_to_i` to 1. This does not affect the values of `prime`, `t`, `rest`, or the conditions on `n`, `x`, and `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `prime_to_i` is updated to 1.
