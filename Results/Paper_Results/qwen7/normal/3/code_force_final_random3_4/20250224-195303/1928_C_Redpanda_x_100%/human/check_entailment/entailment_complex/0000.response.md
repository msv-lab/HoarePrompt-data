### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the settling pattern matches the given position \( x \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The position \( x \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) should match the position \( x \) in the repeating pattern.
   - The number \( x \) received by Vasya should match the value at position \( x \) in the repeating pattern.

3. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - The code iterates through possible values of \( k \) using the `func_1` function, which finds the prime factors of \( n - x \).
   - It checks if \( k \) is even and if \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \geq x \).
   - The code also considers another potential range for \( k \) when \( x \neq 1 \).

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly computes the prime factorization of \( n - x \).
   - It uses a generator to yield the smallest prime factor of \( n - x \).

5. **Function `generate`:**
   - This function generates a sequence of values based on the prime factorization.
   - However, the function `generate` is not used in the main logic of the program, which suggests it might be unnecessary or incorrectly implemented.

6. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic correctly filters out the valid \( k \) values based on the conditions.
   - The use of sets ensures unique values of \( k \).

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the number of possible \( k \) values that satisfy the given conditions. The prime factorization and filtering logic are correctly implemented. The function `generate` is not used in the main logic, but this does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Correctness:

**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
