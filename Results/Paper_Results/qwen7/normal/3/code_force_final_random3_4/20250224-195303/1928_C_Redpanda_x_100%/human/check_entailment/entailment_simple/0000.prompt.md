Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `factor` holds the value 2, which is the last value generated by the `generate(0)` function, and this value has been yielded.

        #State: Output State: All elements in the `rest` list have been processed, meaning `rest` is now an empty list. `prime_to_i` holds the final value which is the product of `prime` raised to the power of the sum of `factors[prime]` over all iterations plus one, and `factor` is the last element of `rest` that was processed, which is now effectively `None` since `rest` is empty. `factors[prime]` is set to 0, indicating that `prime` has been fully processed. The loop has yielded multiple values of `factor * prime_to_i` corresponding to each iteration, but the final state does not include these yielded values as they are not stored in any variable.
        #
        #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the `rest` list is empty, `prime_to_i` is the product of `prime` raised to the power of the sum of `factors[prime]` over all iterations plus one, `factor` is `None` because there are no more elements in `rest`, `factors[prime]` is set to 0, and the loop has yielded several values of `factor * prime_to_i` during its execution.
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9. If k (the length of the list primes) is equal to the length of the list primes, then 1 is yielded. Otherwise, the rest list is empty, prime_to_i holds the product of prime raised to the power of the sum of factors[prime] over all iterations plus one, factor is None because there are no more elements in rest, factors[prime] is set to 0, and the loop has yielded several values of factor * prime_to_i during its execution.
