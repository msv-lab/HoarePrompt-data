Output State: `prime_to_i` is now `prime_to_i * prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `rest` is the list without its first two elements, `factor` is the second element of the modified `rest` list, `factors[prime]` must be at least 2, and `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded after each iteration.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `prime_to_i` will be equal to its initial value multiplied by `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`. The `rest` list remains unchanged except for the removal of its first two elements. The `factor` variable is set to the second element of the modified `rest` list. The condition on `factors[prime]` is that it must be at least 2. After each iteration of the loop, the value `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.
