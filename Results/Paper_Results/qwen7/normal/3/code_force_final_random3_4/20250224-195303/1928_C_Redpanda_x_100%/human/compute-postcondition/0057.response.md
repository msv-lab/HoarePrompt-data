Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\)) and returns a generator that yields the smallest prime factor of `n`. If `n` is a prime number, the generator will yield `n` itself. The function computes the prime factorization of `n` and then generates the smallest prime factor using a generator.**
