Output State: **`prime_to_i` is multiplied by `prime`, and `factor` is now equal to the result of this multiplication.**

In natural language: The value of `prime_to_i` is updated by multiplying it with the variable `prime`. As a result, `factor` now holds the product of the original `factor` (which was previously `prime_to_i * prime`) and the new value of `prime_to_i`.
