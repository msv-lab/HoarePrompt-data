You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:

def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:

    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: The `factors` dictionary now includes an entry for `nn` with its count incremented by 1, provided `nn` is greater than 1. If `nn` is not greater than 1, the dictionary remains unchanged.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and `factor` contains the last value produced by the generator `generate(0)`, which is 2, and it has been yielded.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `factor` holds the value 2, which is the last value generated by the `generate(0)` function, and this value has been yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\)) and returns a generator that yields the smallest prime factor of `n`. If `n` is a prime number, the generator will yield `n` itself. The function computes the prime factorization of `n` and then generates the smallest prime factor using a generator.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.
def generate(k):
    if (k == len(primes)) :
        yield 1
    else :

        #State: Output State: All elements in the `rest` list have been processed, meaning `rest` is now an empty list. `prime_to_i` holds the final value which is the product of `prime` raised to the power of the sum of `factors[prime]` over all iterations plus one, and `factor` is the last element of `rest` that was processed, which is now effectively `None` since `rest` is empty. `factors[prime]` is set to 0, indicating that `prime` has been fully processed. The loop has yielded multiple values of `factor * prime_to_i` corresponding to each iteration, but the final state does not include these yielded values as they are not stored in any variable.
        #
        #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the `rest` list is empty, `prime_to_i` is the product of `prime` raised to the power of the sum of `factors[prime]` over all iterations plus one, `factor` is `None` because there are no more elements in `rest`, `factors[prime]` is set to 0, and the loop has yielded several values of `factor * prime_to_i` during its execution.
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9. If k (the length of the list primes) is equal to the length of the list primes, then 1 is yielded. Otherwise, the rest list is empty, prime_to_i holds the product of prime raised to the power of the sum of factors[prime] over all iterations plus one, factor is None because there are no more elements in rest, factors[prime] is set to 0, and the loop has yielded several values of factor * prime_to_i during its execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate(k)` accepts an integer `k` and returns a sequence of values. For each test case consisting of two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 <= x < n <= 10^9` and `1 <= k <= 100`, the function generates a sequence based on the value of `k`. If `k` equals the length of the list `primes`, the function yields `1`. Otherwise, it processes the list `primes` and the list `factors` to generate a sequence of values, where each value is a product of a factor from the `rest` list and a power of a prime number. The final state of the program includes an empty `rest` list, `prime_to_i` holding the product of the current prime raised to the power of the sum of `factors[prime]` over all iterations plus one, `factor` being `None` since there are no more elements in `rest`, `factors[prime]` set to `0`, and the loop having yielded several values of `factor * prime_to_i` during its execution.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to determine how many values of \( k \) fit the given constraints for each test case.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - Vasya's position in the line is \( n \), and the number he received is \( x \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern is periodic with a period of \( 2k-2 \).
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), we need to find all possible \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) and the settling pattern fits.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions**:
   - `func_1(n)` is intended to find the factors of \( n \).
   - `generate(k)` is intended to generate all possible products of the prime factors raised to various powers.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided functions do not directly solve the problem. They are meant to find the prime factors and their powers, but they are not used correctly to solve the problem at hand.
   - The logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values from the factors is missing.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to determine the period \( 2k-2 \) that fits within the range \( 1 \leq x < n \).
   - We need to check if \( n \mod (2k-2) \) results in \( x \).
   - We need to iterate over possible values of \( k \) and count those that satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:
