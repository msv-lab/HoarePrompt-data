Output State: **`prime_to_i` remains unchanged, `factor` remains unchanged, `factors[prime]` is decremented by 1**.

This means that the value of `prime_to_i` and `factor` remain the same as they were before the code execution. The value of `factors[prime]` is decreased by 1 due to the decrement operation in the code.
