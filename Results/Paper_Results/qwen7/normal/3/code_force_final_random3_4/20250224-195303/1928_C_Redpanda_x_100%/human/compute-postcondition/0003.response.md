Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, and k is not equal to the length of the list of primes; `rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`**.

In this output state, the variable `t` retains its initial condition, and the variables `n`, `x`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The new variable `rest` is assigned the result of the function call `generate(k + 1)`.
