You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        i += 1
    if nn > 1:
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    primes = list(factors.keys())

    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor

#Function 2:
def generate(k):
    if k == len(primes):
        yield 1
    else:
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield (factor * prime_to_i)
                prime_to_i *= prime



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `generate(k)` accepts an integer `k` and returns a sequence of values. For each test case consisting of two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 <= x < n <= 10^9` and `1 <= k <= 100`, the function generates a sequence based on the value of `k`. If `k` equals the length of the list `primes`, the function yields `1`. Otherwise, it processes the list `primes` and the list `factors` to generate a sequence of values, where each value is a product of a factor from the `rest` list and a power of a prime number. The final state of the program includes an empty `rest` list, `prime_to_i` holding the product of the current prime raised to the power of the sum of `factors[prime]` over all iterations plus one, `factor` being `None` since there are no more elements in `rest`, `factors[prime]` set to `0`, and the loop having yielded several values of `factor * prime_to_i` during its execution.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `generate` do not seem to be related to the problem of determining the number of possible values for `k` based on Vasya's position and the number he received during the settling.

The problem requires finding the number of possible values for `k` such that the settling pattern matches the given position and number. However, the provided functions are dealing with prime factors and generating combinations of those factors, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the settling pattern and determine how many `k` values could fit the given constraints. Here is a corrected approach:

```python
def count_possible_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n // 2 + 1):
        position = (x - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1
        if position <= k and position + (x - 1) // (2 * k - 2) * (2 * k - 2) == x:
            count += 1
    return count

# Reading input and processing test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_possible_k(n, x))
```

This corrected program iterates over possible values of `k` and checks if the given position and number match the settling pattern. If they do, it increments the count. This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the number of valid `k` values for each test case.
