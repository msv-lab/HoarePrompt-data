Postcondition: `h1` is a string representing the hour part of a time, `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`, and `time` is set to 'AM'. Specifically, if `h` is '01', `h1` remains '01' and `time` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is any other value from '02' to '22' or '00', `h1` is set to the corresponding value and `time` is set to 'AM'.
