Output State: **`h1` is '04', `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`, `time` is 'PM', and `h` is '16'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the values of `h1`, `m1`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states.
