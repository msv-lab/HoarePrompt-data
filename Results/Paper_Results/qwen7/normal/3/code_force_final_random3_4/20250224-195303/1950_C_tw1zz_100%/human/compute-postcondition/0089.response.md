Output State: **`h1` is '03', `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`, `time` is an empty string, and the value of `h` is `'15'`.**

Explanation: The code `h1 = '03'` assigns the string `'03'` to the variable `h1`. The values of `m1`, `time`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states.
