Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `h1` is a string representing the hour part of a time.
- `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`.
- `time` is set to 'AM'.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop runs for a number of iterations equal to the integer value of the first input.
- There are no variables in the loop head that are directly modified within the loop itself (i.e., no variables like `h1`, `m1`, or `time` are being updated inside the loop).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Input Handling**: The loop takes an integer input and runs for that many iterations.
2. **Loop Body**: Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine any changes to the variables `h1`, `m1`, or `time` within the loop.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as the input integer is greater than 0.

### Conclusion
Since the loop does not modify the variables `h1`, `m1`, or `time`, and the loop condition is based solely on the input integer, the values of `h1`, `m1`, and `time` remain unchanged from the initial state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State
The state of the variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` remains the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`h1` is a string representing the hour part of a time, `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`, and `time` is set to 'AM'.**
