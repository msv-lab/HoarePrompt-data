Output State: **`h` is a string converted from the first input split by ':', `m` is a string converted from the second input split by ':'**.

This means that the code takes an input (a string) and splits it using the colon (`:`) as a delimiter. The first part of the split string is assigned to `h` and the second part is assigned to `m`, both as strings.
