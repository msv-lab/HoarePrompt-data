Output State: **`h1` is '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM'**.

Explanation: The variable `time` is assigned the value `'PM'`. The values of `h1` and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `m` is referenced in `m1`, so `m1` retains its initial value which is equal to `m`.
