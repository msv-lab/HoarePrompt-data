Postcondition: `h1` is a string representing the hour part of a time, `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`, and `time` is either 'AM'. Specifically, if `h` is '07', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '08', `time` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is '09', `time` is also set to 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` can be one of the following strings: '10', '11', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '00', '22', or '01', and `time` is set to either 'AM' or 'PM'.
