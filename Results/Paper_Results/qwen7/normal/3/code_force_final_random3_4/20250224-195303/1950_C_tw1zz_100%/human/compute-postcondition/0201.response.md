Output State: **`h1` is '02', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM'**.

The variable `time` is assigned the value `'AM'`. The values of `h1` and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state of `time` being an empty string is overridden by the assignment, so the final state of `time` is `'AM'`.
