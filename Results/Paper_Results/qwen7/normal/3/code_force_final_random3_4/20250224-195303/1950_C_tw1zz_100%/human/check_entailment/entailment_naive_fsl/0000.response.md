Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the conversion correctly for all cases. Specifically, it fails to convert times starting with '12' properly. For example, the input '12:00' should be converted to '12:00 PM', but the current implementation converts it to '12:00 AM'. This is because the code does not account for the special case of '12' being both AM and PM. A correct solution would handle this edge case appropriately.
