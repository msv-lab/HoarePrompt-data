Output State: **`h1` is '08', `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`, `time` is an empty string, and the value of `h` is `'20'`.**

Explanation: The code `h1 = '08'` assigns the string `'08'` to the variable `h1`. The values of the other variables (`m1`, `time`, and `h`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
