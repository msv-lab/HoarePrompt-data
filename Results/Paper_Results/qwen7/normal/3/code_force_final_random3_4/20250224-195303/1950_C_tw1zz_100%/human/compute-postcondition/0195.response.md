Output State: **`h1` is a string representing the hour part of a new time, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of a new time, and `time` is set to 'AM'.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string using `:` as the delimiter and assigns the resulting strings to `h` and `m`. Since `h1` and `m1` were previously defined as the hour and minute parts of a time (though their specific values were not given), they are now updated to reflect the new input. The variable `time` remains unchanged and is still set to 'AM'.
