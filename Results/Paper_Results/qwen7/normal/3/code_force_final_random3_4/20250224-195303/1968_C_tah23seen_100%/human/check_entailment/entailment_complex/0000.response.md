Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an array \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) such that \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) and \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).
2. The provided solution initializes `ans` with \(10^9\) for all elements, which is a reasonable starting point.
3. The loop correctly updates each element in `ans` from \(ans[n-2]\) down to \(ans[0]\) using the formula \(ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - x[i]\). This ensures that the modulo condition is satisfied for each \(x_i\).
4. The function returns the constructed array `ans`, which should satisfy the given constraints and conditions.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the function, the program appears to correctly implement the required algorithm.

Correctness: **True**
