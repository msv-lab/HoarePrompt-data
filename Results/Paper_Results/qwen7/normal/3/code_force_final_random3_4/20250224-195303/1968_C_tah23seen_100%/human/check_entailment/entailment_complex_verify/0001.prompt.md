You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is calculated as follows: starting from `ans[n-2]` which is `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, each subsequent element `ans[i]` (where i ranges from n-3 to 0) is updated to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`, `i` is now -1.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be -1, and each element in `ans` will have been updated according to the formula given by the loop, starting from `ans[n-2]` down to `ans[0]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `n` is the length of the list `arr` plus one. The last element `ans[n-2]` is `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, and each preceding element `ans[i]` (for i ranging from n-3 to 0) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`. The variable `i` ends up being -1 after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It calculates a new list `ans` of length `n` where the last element `ans[n-2]` is set to `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, and each preceding element `ans[i]` (for i ranging from n-3 to 0) is computed as `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`. After completing these calculations, the function returns the list `ans`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates through each test case, reading `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `arr` and `n` as arguments.
   - The result of `func_1` is stored in `ans`, and the values are printed.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `ans` is initialized with `10^9` for all indices.
   - The loop starts from `n-2` and goes down to `0`.
   - For each index `i`, it sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.

### Checking the Logic

To verify the correctness, let's check if the logic in `func_1` meets the requirements:

- **Initial Values**: 
  - `ans` is initialized to `[10^9, 10^9, ..., 10^9]`. This ensures that the initial value of `a_i` is large enough to satisfy the modulo condition for the first few steps.

- **Backward Calculation**:
  - The loop starts from `n-2` and goes down to `0`.
  - For each `i`, `ans[i]` is set to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.
  - This ensures that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true because `a_i` is derived from `a_{i+1}` and `x_i`.

### Example Verification

Let's verify with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - `arr = [2, 4, 1]`
  - `n = 4`
  - Initial `ans = [1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]`
  - After processing:
    - `ans[2] = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999`
    - `ans[1] = 999999999 - 4 = 999999995`
    - `ans[0] = 999999995 - 2 = 999999993`
  - Result: `[999999993, 999999995, 999999999, 1000000000]`

However, this does not match the expected output `[3, 5, 4, 9]`. Let's re-evaluate the logic.

### Corrected Logic

The provided solution does not directly match the required conditions. Instead, we should ensure that `a_i` is chosen such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`. A simpler approach would be to set `a_i = x_i + a_{i-1}`.

### Corrected Program

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = [1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1
```

### Conclusion

The original program does not correctly implement the logic to find `a_i` such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
