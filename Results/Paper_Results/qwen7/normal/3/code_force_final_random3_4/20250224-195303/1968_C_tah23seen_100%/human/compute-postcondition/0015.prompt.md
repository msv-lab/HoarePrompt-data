You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is calculated as follows: starting from `ans[n-2]` which is `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, each subsequent element `ans[i]` (where i ranges from n-3 to 0) is updated to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`, `i` is now -1.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be -1, and each element in `ans` will have been updated according to the formula given by the loop, starting from `ans[n-2]` down to `ans[0]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `n` is the length of the list `arr` plus one. The last element `ans[n-2]` is `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, and each preceding element `ans[i]` (for i ranging from n-3 to 0) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`. The variable `i` ends up being -1 after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of n-1 integers, and `n`, which is the length of the list `arr` plus one. The function returns a list `ans` of length `n`. The last element `ans[n-2]` is `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, and each preceding element `ans[i]` (for i ranging from n-3 to 0) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `n` is the length of the list `arr` plus one. The last element `ans[n-2]` is `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, and each preceding element `ans[i]` (for i ranging from n-3 to 0) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`. The variable `i` ends up being -1 after the loop completes.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
