Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except `ans[n-2]` which is `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`, `i` is n - 5, `ans[i]` is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` and `ans[i]` is updated to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Given that initially `ans[i]` was `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, the value remains unchanged. The other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
