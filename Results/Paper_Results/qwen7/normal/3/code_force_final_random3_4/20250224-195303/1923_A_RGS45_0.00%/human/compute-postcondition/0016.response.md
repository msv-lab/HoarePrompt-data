Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is the input integer from the user, `arr` is a new string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`, `n` is updated to an input integer**.

This means that the variable `n` has been updated to the integer value entered by the user, while all other variables retain their previous states.
