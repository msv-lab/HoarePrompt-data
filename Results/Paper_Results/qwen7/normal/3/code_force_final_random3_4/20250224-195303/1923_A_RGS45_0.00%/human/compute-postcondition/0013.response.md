Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`.**

Explanation: The code `z = arr[x:n - y]` assigns a substring of `arr` to `z`. This substring starts at index `x` (the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`) and ends just before the index `n - y` (where `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`). All other variables remain unchanged.
