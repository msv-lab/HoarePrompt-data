Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 1 inclusive, `n` is the input integer from the user, `arr` is the final string input from the user after all iterations, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y` after all iterations have completed.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 or 1 (since it decreases by 1 each iteration and starts at a value no greater than 1000), `n` will be the last input integer, `arr` will be the last string input, and `x`, `y`, and `z` will reflect the positions and content of '1's in the final `arr` as described.
