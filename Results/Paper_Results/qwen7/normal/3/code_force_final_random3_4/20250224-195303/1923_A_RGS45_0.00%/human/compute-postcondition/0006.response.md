Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found in `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found in `arr`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `z = arr[x:n - y]` slices the string `arr` from index `x` (inclusive) to `n - y` (exclusive). This means `z` will contain characters from `arr` starting at the first occurrence of '1' (if it exists) up to but not including the position `n - y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
