Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by an integer `n` and a string `arr` consisting of `n` characters, each being '0' or '1'. It then finds the indices of the first and last '1' in `arr`. Using these indices, it extracts a substring `z` from `arr`. Finally, it counts and prints the number of '0's in `z`.**
