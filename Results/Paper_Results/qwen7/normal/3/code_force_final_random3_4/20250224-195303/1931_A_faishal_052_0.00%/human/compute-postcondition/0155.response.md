Given the initial state where `k` is 2, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')` statement.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Value of `k`:** The initial state explicitly states that `k` is 2.
2. **Value of `arr[k]`:** Since `k` is 2, we need to find the value of `arr[2]`. However, the initial state does not provide the explicit value of `arr[2]`. We can only describe it as the third element of the list `arr`.

The formula inside the `chr` function is `arr[k] + 96`. Given that `k` is 2, this translates to `arr[2] + 96`.

3. **Value of `chr(arr[2] + 96)`:** The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding Unicode character. If `arr[2]` is an integer, adding 96 to it will shift the character by 96 positions in the Unicode table. For example, if `arr[2]` is 1, then `arr[2] + 96 = 97`, and `chr(97)` is 'a'. 

Since the exact value of `arr[2]` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the value of `arr[2]`.

Therefore, the output will be the character corresponding to `arr[2] + 96`.

Output: **chr(arr[2] + 96)**
