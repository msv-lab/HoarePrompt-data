Output State: The loop has executed all 3 iterations, and the final output is 'a b z'.

Explanation: After the loop completes all 3 iterations, the value of `k` becomes 2. Since the loop prints `chr(arr[k] + 96)` for each iteration where `k` ranges from 0 to 2, and given that `arr` is initially one of the provided lists (all of which contain 1 or 26), the final values in `arr` will be such that when sorted, they map to 'a', 'b', and 'z' in the alphabet. Specifically, if `arr` was sorted to [1, 26, 26] (or any permutation that sorts to these values), the output would be 'a b z'.
