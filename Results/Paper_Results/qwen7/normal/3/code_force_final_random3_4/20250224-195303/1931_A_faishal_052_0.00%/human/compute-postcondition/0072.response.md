Postcondition: `cases` is 3, `arr` is either `[1]` or `[26]`, `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is set to `[1]` and `lex` is set to `lex - 1`. Otherwise, `arr` is set to `[26]` and if `lex` is less than 52, `lex` is set to `lex - 26`.
