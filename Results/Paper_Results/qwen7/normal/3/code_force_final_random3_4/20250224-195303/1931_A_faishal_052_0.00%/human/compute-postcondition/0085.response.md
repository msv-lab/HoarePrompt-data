Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is either `[1, 1, 1]` or `[26, 1, 1]` or `[1, 26, 1]` or `[26, 26, 1]`, `j` is 2, and `lex` is an input integer reduced by either 1 or 26 depending on whether `lex` is less than or equal to 26.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was either `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, or `[26, 26]`, after appending `1`, it becomes `[1, 1, 1]`, `[26, 1, 1]`, `[1, 26, 1]`, or `[26, 26, 1]`. The values of `cases`, `j`, and `lex` remain unchanged.
