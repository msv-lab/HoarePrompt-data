Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for k in range(3)`. The variables involved here are `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `k`**: The loop starts with `k` being 0 because `range(3)` generates values from 0 to 2.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: Since the loop is defined as `for k in range(3)`, it will always execute as long as `k` is within the range 0 to 2. There are no conditions specified in the loop head that would prevent the loop from executing.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - `j` is not part of the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted.
   - `lex` is not part of the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted.
   - `arr` is not part of the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted.
   - `k` should be set to the initial value of the loop, which is 0.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to be 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is 0**
