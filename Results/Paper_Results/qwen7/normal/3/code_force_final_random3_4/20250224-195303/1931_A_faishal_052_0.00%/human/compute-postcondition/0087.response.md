Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is either `[1, 1, 26]` or `[26, 1, 26]` or `[1, 26, 26]` or `[26, 26, 26]`, `j` is 2, and `lex` is an input integer reduced by either 1 or 26 depending on whether `lex` is less than or equal to 26.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` could initially be one of four different lists, appending `26` to each of these lists results in four possible new lists. The other variables (`cases`, `j`, and `lex`) remain unchanged.
