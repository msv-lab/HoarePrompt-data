Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `k` is explicitly given as 1.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet is `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - We need to determine the value of `arr[k]` where `k` is 1.
   - Since the initial state does not provide the explicit value of `arr`, we cannot determine the exact character that will be printed. However, we can describe it based on the formula used in the code.

4. **Formula**:
   - The formula used is `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.
   - This means that the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` will be printed.

Given the above analysis, since the exact value of `arr[1]` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the formula.

Output: **the character corresponding to the ASCII value of arr[1] + 96**
