Output State: **`j` is 0, `lex` is greater than 26 and greater than or equal to 52, and `arr` contains the element 26**.

Explanation: The code appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. Since `j` was initially 0 and did not change, and `lex` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code, the updated state includes `arr` now containing the element 26.
