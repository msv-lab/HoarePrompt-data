Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is a value less than or equal to 25; `arr` is [1]**.

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, so if the original value of `lex` was `k`, the new value of `lex` is `k-1`, which is still less than or equal to 25 since the original value was less than or equal to 26. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
