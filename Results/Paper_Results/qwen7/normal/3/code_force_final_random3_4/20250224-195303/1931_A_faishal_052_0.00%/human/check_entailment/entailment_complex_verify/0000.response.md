### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step and compare it with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that encodes to a given integer `n`.
- The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
- The program should handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   cases = int(input())
   ```
   - Reads the number of test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   ```python
   for i in range(cases):
       arr = []
       lex = int(input())
   ```
   - Initializes an empty list `arr` and reads the encoded integer `lex`.

3. **Filling the Array `arr`:**
   ```python
   for j in range(2):
       if lex <= 26:
           arr.append(1)
           lex = lex - 1
       elif lex < 52:
           arr.append(26)
           lex = lex - 26
       else:
           arr.append(26)
           lex = lex - 26
   ```
   - This loop attempts to fill the array `arr` with the largest possible values (1 or 26) until `lex` is reduced below 26.
   - The logic here is flawed because it does not correctly distribute the remaining value after assigning the maximum possible values to the last two characters.

4. **Appending the Remaining Value:**
   ```python
   arr.append(lex)
   ```
   - Appends the remaining value to `arr`.

5. **Sorting and Printing:**
   ```python
   arr.sort()
   for k in range(3):
       print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```
   - Sorts the array `arr` and prints the first three characters.

#### Example Walkthrough:
- **Input:** `55`
  - `lex = 55`
  - First loop:
    - `lex > 26` → `arr.append(26)` → `arr = [26]`, `lex = 29`
    - `lex > 26` → `arr.append(26)` → `arr = [26, 26]`, `lex = 3`
  - `arr.append(3)`
  - `arr = [26, 26, 3]`
  - Sorting: `arr = [26, 26, 3]`
  - Output: `azz`

- **Expected Output:** `czz`

The program incorrectly handles the distribution of the remaining value `3` after appending `26` twice. It should append `3` to the array in a way that maintains the lexicographically smallest word.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the remaining value is distributed in a way that forms the lexicographically smallest word. Here's a corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        arr = [1, 1, 1]
        for j in range(3):
            if lex >= 26:
                arr[j] += 26
                lex -= 26
            else:
                arr[j] += lex
                break
        print(''.join(chr(a + 96) for a in arr))
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle all cases and fails to produce the lexicographically smallest word for certain inputs. Therefore, the final evaluation remains:

**Final: False**
