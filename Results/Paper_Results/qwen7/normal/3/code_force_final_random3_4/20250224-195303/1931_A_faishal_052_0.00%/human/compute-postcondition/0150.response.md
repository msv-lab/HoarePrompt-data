Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables `k` and the range function. The variable `k` is initialized to 0 and will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 3 (since `range(3)` generates values from 0 to 2).

2. **Determine the Initial State of `k`**: Since the loop starts with `k = 0`, we need to ensure that `k` is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

3. **Determine the Range Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than 3. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is within this range when the loop starts.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to adjust the state such that `k` is 0 at the start of the loop, and the condition `k < 3` is satisfied.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is 2
- `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26
- `arr` contains the elements 1, 26, and `lex`, sorted in ascending order

We only need to focus on adjusting the state of `k`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `k` should be 0 at the start of the loop.
- The condition `k < 3` should be satisfied.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to:

State: **`k` is 0**
