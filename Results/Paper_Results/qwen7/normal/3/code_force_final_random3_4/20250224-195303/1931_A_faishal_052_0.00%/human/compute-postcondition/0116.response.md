Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52; `arr` contains the element 26**.

The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged. Therefore, `j` is still 0, `lex` is still greater than 26 and less than 52, and `arr` now contains the element 26.
