Output State: **j is 2, lex is a value less than or equal to 27, and arr contains the elements [1, 1]**.

Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `j` will be 2 because the loop runs twice (as specified by the `range(2)`). The variable `lex` will be a value less than or equal to 27 because each iteration of the loop decreases `lex` by 26, and since the loop runs twice, `lex` can decrease by a maximum of 52 but starts from a value less than or equal to 53 (as seen from the previous output state after 2 iterations). The list `arr` will contain the elements [1, 1] because in each iteration of the loop, as long as `lex` is greater than 26, it appends 26 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 26, resulting in two 1s being appended to `arr` in the first iteration and no further changes in the second iteration since `lex` would already be reduced to a value less than or equal to 26.
