You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a', 'b', and 'c' in sequence.
    #
    #Explanation: Given the loop runs three times as specified by `range(3)`, and each iteration processes the value of `lex` to form an array `arr` which is then sorted and printed. Regardless of the initial value of `lex` (as long as it's within the given constraints), the final sorted array `arr` will always be `[1, 26, lex]` after the operations inside the loop. When sorted, this array becomes `[1, 26, lex]` (assuming `lex` is less than or equal to 26). Converting these values to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)` results in 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Therefore, after all iterations, the loop prints 'a', 'b', and 'c' in sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each involving an integer `lex`. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of values based on `lex` and prints the first three characters of the resulting sequence. Specifically, it converts the calculated values into characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' and outputs them in that order. The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to produce the lexicographically smallest word for certain inputs. For instance, consider the input `55`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that encodes to `55` should be `"czz"`, but the program outputs `"azz"` instead. This happens because the program logic does not correctly distribute the remaining value after assigning the maximum possible values to the last two characters.
