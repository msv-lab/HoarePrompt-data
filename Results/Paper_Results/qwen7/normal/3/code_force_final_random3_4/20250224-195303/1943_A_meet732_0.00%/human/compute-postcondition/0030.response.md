Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is decreased by 2 (though the exact value of `c` is not needed for this specific print statement).
- `j` is explicitly stated to be 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (though its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement).
- `cntl[2]` is less than 2 (though its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement).

The `print(j)` statement will simply print the value of `j`.

Output: **2**
