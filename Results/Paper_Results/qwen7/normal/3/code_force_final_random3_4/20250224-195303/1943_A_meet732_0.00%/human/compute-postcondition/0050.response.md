Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in a:`. This means the loop variable `i` is taken from the list `a`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`c`, `j`, `n`, `cntl`) are not directly involved in the loop condition or the loop body, so they do not need to be adjusted.

3. **State the final adjusted state**: The only object in the loop head that needs adjustment is `a`. Therefore, `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must contain at least one element**
