Output State: **`c` is decreased by 2, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `cntl[2]` is less than 2**

Explanation: The value of `c` is decreased by 1, making it decreased by 2 from its initial state (since it was already decreased by 1 before this line). The values of `j`, `n`, and `cntl[2]` remain unchanged.
