Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `cntl[j]` is less than 1, and either `c` is False or `j` equals `n`.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the current loop or block of code. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered within the given code snippet, the initial conditions remain unchanged.
