Output State: **`j` is 3, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, `c` is equal to the original value of `c` minus 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, the `break` statement implies that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `j`, `cntl[2]`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
