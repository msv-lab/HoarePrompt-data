Output State: **`n` is the integer value entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer using the `int()` function, and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which is that they must hold a valid integer value (though the specific value is not known without user input).
