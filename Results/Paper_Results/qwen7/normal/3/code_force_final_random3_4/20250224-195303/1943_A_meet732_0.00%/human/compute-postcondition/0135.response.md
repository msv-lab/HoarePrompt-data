Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, the `cntl` list will be updated such that each index `i` (where `i` is an element in the list `a`) will have a value equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`. Specifically, if an element `i` appears `x` times in `a`, then `cntl[i]` will be `x`. All other elements in `cntl` that do not correspond to any element in `a` will remain `0`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` will be `0`. If the loop breaks early due to `c` becoming `0` or `j` reaching `n`, the final value of `c` will be `n - j`.**
