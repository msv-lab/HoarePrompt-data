Output State: The `cntl` list will be updated such that each index `i` (where `i` is an element in the list `a`) will have its value incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`.

In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop, the `cntl` list will contain the count of how many times each integer from the input list `a` appeared. Each index in `cntl` corresponds to an integer from `a`, and the value at that index represents the frequency of that integer in `a`.
