Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop, often representing the current iteration index.
   - `input()`: This function is called to read input from the user.

2. **Determine the initial state required for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `input()` provides valid input.
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder and doesn't affect the loop's execution directly, we don't need to adjust its state.
   - The critical part is ensuring that `input()` returns a valid value that can be converted to an integer.

3. **Adjust the state based on the loop requirements**:
   - We need to ensure that `input()` returns a valid integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4). However, since the exact value of `t` is not needed for the loop to execute, we only need to ensure that the input is a valid integer.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input that will be read by `input()`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`input()` must return a valid integer**
