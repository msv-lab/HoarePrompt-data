Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This means the loop will stop when `j` becomes equal to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0
   - `cntl[j]` is less than 2
   - Either `c` is False or `j` equals `n`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1, the loop will increment `j` by 1 in the next iteration, making `j` equal to 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than or equal to `n`.
   - The condition `cntl[j] < 2` must hold true for `j = 2`.
   - The condition `c` being False or `j` equaling `n` does not change with each iteration of the loop.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `j` and `cntl[j]`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.
   - `cntl[j]` must still be less than 2, so `cntl[2]` must be less than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, and either `c` is False or `j` equals `n`**
