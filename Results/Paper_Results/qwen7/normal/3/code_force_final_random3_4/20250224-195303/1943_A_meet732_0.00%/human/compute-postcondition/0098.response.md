Output State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `i` is the next element in `a`**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. The value of `i` remains the same as it was in the initial state, being the next element in `a`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
