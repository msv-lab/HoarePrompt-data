Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `a` contains at least one element.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1 (this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
   - `a` must contain at least one element.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `a` containing at least one element, for the loop to execute again, `a` must still contain at least one element.
   - The variable `i` is used within the loop body but its value is not relevant to the loop continuation condition.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `a`, which must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `a` must contain at least one element**
