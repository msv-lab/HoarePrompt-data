Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `cntl[j]` is less than 1**

Explanation: The value of `c` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `c`, and it is not used in the operation, we cannot determine its new value. However, we know that `cntl[j]` was less than 2 and after subtracting 1 from `c`, it became less than 1. Therefore, the updated condition for `cntl[j]` is less than 1.
