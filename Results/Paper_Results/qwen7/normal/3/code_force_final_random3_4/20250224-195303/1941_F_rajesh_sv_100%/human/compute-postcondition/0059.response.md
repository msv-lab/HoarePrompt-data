Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` must be greater than `l`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`.**

Explanation: The code reassigns the value of `mid` to `l + (h - l) // 2`, which is the same as the initial value of `mid`. The values of `h`, `l`, and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the reassigned `mid` and the unchanged `h`, `l`, and their conditions.
