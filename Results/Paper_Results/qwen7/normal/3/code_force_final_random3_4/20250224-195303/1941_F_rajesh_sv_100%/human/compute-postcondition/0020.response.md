Postcondition: `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `i`, and `diff` are as follows: 
- If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `max_diff`, `index` is set to 3, `i` is set to 3, and `diff` remains `A[1] - A[0]`.
- Otherwise, `max_diff` remains `-inf`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `index` remains `None`, `i` remains 2, and `diff` remains `A[1] - A[0]`.
