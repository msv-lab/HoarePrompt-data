Output State: `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is greater than `l`, and `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the final values of `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` will be as described. The variable `mid` will be recalculated in each iteration as `l + (h - l) // 2`. The condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` will either update `l` to `mid + 1` or `h` to `mid`. This process continues until `l` is no longer less than `h`, meaning the loop terminates with `h` being greater than `l`. The value of `l` will remain the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`, as it is not updated unless `h` is set to `mid` in the loop body.
