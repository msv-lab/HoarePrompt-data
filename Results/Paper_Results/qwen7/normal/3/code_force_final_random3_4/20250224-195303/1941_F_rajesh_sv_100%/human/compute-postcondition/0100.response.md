Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is `mid`, `ans` is set based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`**.

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to `mid + 1`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `h`, `ans`, and `mid`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
