Output State: **`h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`.**

Explanation: The variable `h` is assigned the value of `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`. The function `bisect_left` returns the index of the leftmost occurrence of `right - f` in the list `D`, or the position where `right - f` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted. Subtracting 1 from this value gives us `h`. The value of `l` remains unchanged as it was determined before the execution of this line of code.
