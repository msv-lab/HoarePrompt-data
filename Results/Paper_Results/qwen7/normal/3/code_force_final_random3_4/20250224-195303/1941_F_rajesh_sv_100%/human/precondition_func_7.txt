testcases is an integer such that 1 <= testcases <= 10^4. For each testcase, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}. d is a list of m integers where 1 <= d_i <= 10^9. f is a list of k integers where 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
