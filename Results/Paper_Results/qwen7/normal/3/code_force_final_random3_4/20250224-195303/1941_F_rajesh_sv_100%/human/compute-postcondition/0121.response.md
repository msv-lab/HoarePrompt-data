Output State: **`total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` and `h` are equal to each other, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mid` to `l + (h - l) // 2`. Since `l` and `h` are equal to each other, the expression simplifies to `mid` being equal to `l`. All other variables (`total`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
