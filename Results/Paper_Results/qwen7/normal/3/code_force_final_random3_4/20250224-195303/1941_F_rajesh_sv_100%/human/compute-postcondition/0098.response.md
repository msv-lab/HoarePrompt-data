Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is less than `mid`, `h` is `mid`, `ans` is set based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`**.

This means that the value of `mid` has been updated to the midpoint between `l` and `h`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
