Output State: **`total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `mid = l + (h - l) // 2` simply reassigns the value of `mid` to the same expression `l + (h - l) // 2`. Since `mid` was already set to this value before, the assignment does not change its value. All other variables (`total`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
