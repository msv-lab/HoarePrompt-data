Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n, m, and k, where n is a positive integer between 2 and 10^5, m and k are positive integers between 1 and 2 Ã— 10^5. Additionally, A is a list of n strictly increasing integers, D is a list of unique integers, and F is a list of k integers. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the lists A, D, and F based on the given constraints.**
