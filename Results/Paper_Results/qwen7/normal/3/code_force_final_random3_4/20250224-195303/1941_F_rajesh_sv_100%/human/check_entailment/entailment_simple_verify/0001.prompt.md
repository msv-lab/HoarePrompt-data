You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of prepared problems `n`, the number of models `m`, and the number of functions `k`.
   - It then reads the complexities of the prepared problems `A`.
   - It reads the complexities of the models `D` and the complexities of the functions `F`.

2. **Finding Initial Imbalance:**
   - The program calculates the initial imbalance by finding the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list of prepared problems `A`.
   - This is done using a loop that iterates through the list and updates `max_diff` and `next_max_diff`.

3. **Adding New Problems:**
   - For each function `f` in `F`, the program tries to find a suitable model `d` from `D` to minimize the new imbalance.
   - It uses binary search (`bisect_right` and `bisect_left`) to find the optimal positions for the new problem complexities `left + f` and `right - f`.
   - It calculates the new potential imbalances and updates the answer `ans` accordingly.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - After processing all functions, the program outputs the minimum possible imbalance.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Initialization and Input Reading:**
  - The program correctly reads and processes the input as specified in the problem statement.

- **Initial Imbalance Calculation:**
  - The logic for calculating the initial imbalance is correct. It correctly identifies the largest gap between consecutive elements in the sorted list of prepared problems.

- **Adding New Problems:**
  - The use of binary search to find the optimal positions for the new problem complexities is correct. This ensures that the program efficiently finds the minimum possible imbalance by considering all possible new problems.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly outputs the minimum possible imbalance after considering all possible new problems.

### Conclusion:

Given that the program correctly implements the steps required to solve the problem and handles all aspects of the input and output as specified, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
