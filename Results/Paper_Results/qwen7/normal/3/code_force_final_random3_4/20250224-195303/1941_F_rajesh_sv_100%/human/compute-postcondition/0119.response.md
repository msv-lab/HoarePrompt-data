Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` and `h` are equal to each other, representing the final boundaries of the search range. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is `mid` and `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`.**
