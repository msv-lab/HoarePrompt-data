Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `f` from the range defined by `F`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are values in `F` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.
   - `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`.
   - `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.
   - `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.
   - `l` equals `h`.
   - `h` equals `l`.

4. **Adjusting the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `f` from `F`, the only variable that changes in each iteration is `f`.
   - The other variables (`ans`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, `l`, `h`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but based on the given information, they are not modified.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - The only thing that changes is the value of `f` in the next iteration. Since `f` comes from `F`, it will take the next value in the sequence defined by `F`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `mid_sum` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `mid_next_sum` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `mid` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `l` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `h` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `f` will be the next value in the sequence defined by `F`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` equals `h`, `h` equals `l`, `f` is the next value in `F`**.
