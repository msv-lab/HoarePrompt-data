Output State: **`i` is 6, `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `max_diff` remains unchanged, `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `max_diff` to `next_max_diff`. Since `max_diff` remains unchanged, `next_max_diff` now holds the same value as `max_diff`. All other variables retain their initial states.
