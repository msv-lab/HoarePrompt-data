Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A` from index 1 to `n-1`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found under the same conditions, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found, `i` is `n`, `diff` is the last calculated difference which is `A[n-1] - A[n-2]`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`
Code of the loop:
for f in F:
    l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
    h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
    while l < h:
        mid = l + (h - l) // 2
        mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
        if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            h = mid
    if l == h:
        ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` equals `h`, and `h` equals `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` holds the minimum value among all the updates made during the loop, `mid` is the last midpoint calculated before the loop exited, `l` and `h` are equal to each other (representing the final boundaries of the search range), `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are the sums of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` for the last midpoint `mid`, and `f` is the last value from the sequence `F` used in the comparisons. If `l` equals `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is 0, `mid` is the final midpoint where the loop exits, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` and `h` are equal to each other, representing the final boundaries of the search range, and the condition `l == h` is true. `ans` is the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
