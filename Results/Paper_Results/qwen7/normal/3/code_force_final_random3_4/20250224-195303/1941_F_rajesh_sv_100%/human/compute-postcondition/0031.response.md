Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), so `i` will increment by 1 each iteration.
3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 5.
   - `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`.
   - If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff` and `index` is set to 5. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, otherwise `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `6`.

5. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - The values of `diff`, `max_diff`, and `next_max_diff` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless they were updated within the loop body.

Given this information, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to `6`.

**State: **`i` is 6, `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`, `max_diff` remains unchanged, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged**.
