Postcondition: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` equals `h`, and `h` equals `l`.**

This means that after executing the if-else block, the variable `ans` is set to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The variables `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, `l`, and `h` retain their values from the precondition, with `l` and `h` being equal due to the condition `l == h` in the if part.
