Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `mid` using the formula `l + (h - l) // 2`. This formula is used to find the middle index between `l` and `h`. The values of `h` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `l` must be less than `h` still holds true.
