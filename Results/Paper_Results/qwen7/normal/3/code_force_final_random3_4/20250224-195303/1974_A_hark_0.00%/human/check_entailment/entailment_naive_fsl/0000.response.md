Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` does not accurately account for the placement of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the screens.

Let's analyze the logic in `func_2`:
1. It calculates `bxsfory` which is the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the remaining space after placing the maximum possible 1x1 icons.
2. It then calculates `x` as `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, but this calculation seems incorrect because it doesn't properly reflect the space taken by 1x1 icons.
3. The calculation `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` for `bxsfory1` is also flawed because it doesn't correctly account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input: `12 4`
- Expected output: `2`

However, the current implementation might produce an incorrect result. For instance, if we manually calculate:
- We can place 3 2x2 icons (each taking 4 cells), leaving us with 12 - 3*4 = 0 cells for 1x1 icons.
- This means we need 2 screens (1 for the 2x2 icons and 1 for the remaining 1x1 icons).

But the current implementation might incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed, leading to an incorrect output.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
