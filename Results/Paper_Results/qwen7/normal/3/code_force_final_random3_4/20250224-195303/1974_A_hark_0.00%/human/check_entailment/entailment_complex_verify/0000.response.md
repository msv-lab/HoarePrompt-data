### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the logic in `func_2` to determine if the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `x` represents the number of 1x1 icons.
   - `y` represents the number of 2x2 icons.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are positive.**
     - The code calculates `bxsfory` as `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the remaining space after placing the maximum possible 1x1 icons.
     - Then, it adjusts `x` using the formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This adjustment seems incorrect because it doesn't properly reflect the space taken by 1x1 icons.
     - Finally, it calculates `bxsfory1` as `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`, which is supposed to give the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - The final output is `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.

   - **Case 2: Only `y` is positive.**
     - The code directly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons as `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

   - **Case 3: Only `x` is positive.**
     - The code calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons as `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

   - **Case 4: Neither `x` nor `y` is positive.**
     - The code outputs `0`.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The main issue lies in the adjustment of `x` using the formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This formula does not correctly account for the space taken by 1x1 icons when there are 2x2 icons present.
   - The calculation `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` for `bxsfory1` also seems flawed because it doesn't correctly account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider the test case `12 4`:
- We can place 3 2x2 icons (each taking 4 cells), leaving us with 12 - 3*4 = 0 cells for 1x1 icons.
- This means we need 2 screens (1 for the 2x2 icons and 1 for the remaining 1x1 icons).

However, the current implementation might produce an incorrect result. For instance, if we manually calculate:
- We can place 3 2x2 icons (each taking 4 cells), leaving us with 12 - 3*4 = 0 cells for 1x1 icons.
- This means we need 2 screens (1 for the 2x2 icons and 1 for the remaining 1x1 icons).

But the current implementation might incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed, leading to an incorrect output.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons due to the flawed logic in `func_2`.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
