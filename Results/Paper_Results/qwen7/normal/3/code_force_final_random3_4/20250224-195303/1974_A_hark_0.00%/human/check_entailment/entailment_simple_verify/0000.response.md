### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the logic in `func_2` and verify its correctness step-by-step using the provided annotations and example test cases.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` and `y` are non-negative integers representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**
   - Calculate `bxsfory` as `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This represents the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the grid.
   - Adjust `x` as `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This step seems incorrect because it doesn't properly reflect the space taken by 1x1 icons.
     - `bxsfory * 15` should be `bxsfory * 4` because each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.
     - `y * 4` is correct as each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.
   - Calculate `bxsfory1` as `0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.
     - This step is also incorrect because it doesn't correctly account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
     - The correct calculation should be `math.ceil((x + bxsfory * 4) / 15)`.
   - Print `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.

3. **Case 2: Only `y` is greater than 0**
   - Directly print `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

4. **Case 3: Only `x` is greater than 0**
   - Directly print `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

5. **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**
   - Print `0`.

#### Example Test Case: `12 4`

- Initial values: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
- `bxsfory = math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`
- Adjust `x`: `x - 2 * 4 + 4 * 4 = 12 - 8 + 16 = 20`
- Calculate `bxsfory1`: `math.ceil(20 / 15) + 1 = 2`
- Print `2 + 2 = 4`

This result is clearly incorrect. The expected output should be `2` because we can place 3 2x2 icons (each taking 4 cells), leaving us with 12 - 3*4 = 0 cells for 1x1 icons, requiring only 2 screens.

#### Correct Approach

The correct approach should be:
1. Place as many 2x2 icons as possible.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space.
4. Calculate the total number of screens needed.

Here is the corrected logic:
```python
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    bxsfory = min(y, x // 4)
    x -= bxsfory * 4
    bxsfory1 = math.ceil((x + bxsfory * 4) / 15)
    print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
```

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons due to the flawed logic in `func_2`.

**Final: False**
