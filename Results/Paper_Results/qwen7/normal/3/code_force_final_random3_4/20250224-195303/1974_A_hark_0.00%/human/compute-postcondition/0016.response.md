Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers. If `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `bxsfory * 15` and `y` is greater than 0, then `x` is adjusted according to specific rules (either set to twice the value of `x` or incremented by 5 based on the value of `x`). If `x` is 0, then `y` is a non-negative integer greater than 0. If `x` is not 0, then `y` is set to 0.**
