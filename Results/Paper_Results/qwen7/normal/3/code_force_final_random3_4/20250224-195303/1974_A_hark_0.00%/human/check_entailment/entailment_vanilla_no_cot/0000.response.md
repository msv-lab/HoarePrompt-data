Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic within `func_2` is flawed and does not accurately calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The formula `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` assumes that every 2x2 icon requires 2 full 1x1 cells, which is incorrect. A 2x2 icon actually occupies 4 cells, so this calculation should be adjusted.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - The remaining 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons should be calculated properly. The current logic subtracts `y * 4` from `x`, which is not accurate because it doesn't account for the placement of 2x2 icons correctly.

3. **Incorrect Calculation for Remaining Space:**
   - The remaining space after placing 2x2 icons needs to be recalculated correctly. The current logic uses `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`, but this does not account for the actual number of 1x1 cells available after placing 2x2 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 0 and y == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        # Calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit
        bxsfory = min(y, (x + 3) // 4)  # Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, and we need to leave 3 cells for the next row
        x -= bxsfory * 4  # Subtract the space taken by 2x2 icons
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space
        bxsfory1 = (x + 14) // 15  # Each 1x1 icon takes 1 cell, and we need to account for the full rows
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the placement of 2x2 icons is handled correctly and the remaining space is used optimally for 1x1 icons.
