Reasoning:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function simply returns the smaller of two integers `a` and `b`. While this function is correctly implemented, it is not directly used in the main logic of the program. Therefore, its correctness does not affect the overall correctness of the program.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function handles the logic for calculating the minimum number of screens needed. Let's break down its logic:
  - If both `x` and `y` are positive, it calculates the number of 2x2 icons (`bxsfory`) and adjusts the number of 1x1 icons (`x`). Then, it calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`bxsfory1`) and adds them to the initial count.
  - If only `y` is positive, it directly calculates the number of screens needed based on `y`.
  - If only `x` is positive, it calculates the number of screens needed based on `x`.
  - If neither `x` nor `y` is positive, it prints `0`.

  The logic seems to be designed to handle different scenarios correctly, but let's verify the calculations:
  - For 2x2 icons, each screen can hold up to 2 icons (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each row has 6 cells, thus 3 rows can fit 2 icons each).
  - For 1x1 icons, each screen can hold up to 15 icons (since each row has 6 cells, and there are 5 rows).

  The function correctly accounts for the placement of both types of icons and calculates the minimum number of screens needed.

- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function processes `t` test cases, calling `func_2` for each case. It correctly initializes `t` and iterates through each test case, ensuring that the output is produced for each test case.

Given the detailed breakdown, the logic in `func_2` appears to be correctly handling the placement of icons and calculating the minimum number of screens needed. The overall structure of the program, including the loops and function calls, is consistent with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
