Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 0.

Explanation: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the input integer. Since the loop decreases the value of `t` by 1 with each iteration (implied by the problem's progression), after all iterations, `t` will be less than or equal to 0. However, since `t` starts as a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, the final value of `t` after all iterations will still satisfy the condition of being an integer greater than 0.
