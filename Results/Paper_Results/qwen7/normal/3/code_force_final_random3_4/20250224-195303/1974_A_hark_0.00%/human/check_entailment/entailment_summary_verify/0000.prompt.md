You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it calls another function `func_2()`, which processes two integers `x` and `y` (where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the variable `t` is an integer greater than 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` does not accurately account for the placement of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the screens.

Let's analyze the logic in `func_2`:
1. It calculates `bxsfory` which is the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the remaining space after placing the maximum possible 1x1 icons.
2. It then calculates `x` as `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, but this calculation seems incorrect because it doesn't properly reflect the space taken by 1x1 icons.
3. The calculation `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` for `bxsfory1` is also flawed because it doesn't correctly account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input: `12 4`
- Expected output: `2`

However, the current implementation might produce an incorrect result. For instance, if we manually calculate:
- We can place 3 2x2 icons (each taking 4 cells), leaving us with 12 - 3*4 = 0 cells for 1x1 icons.
- This means we need 2 screens (1 for the 2x2 icons and 1 for the remaining 1x1 icons).

But the current implementation might incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed, leading to an incorrect output.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
