Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function simply returns the smaller of the two values `a` and `b`. It does not seem to be used in the main logic of the program, so we can ignore it for now.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - It calculates the number of screens needed based on the following logic:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons (`math.ceil(y / 2)`) and then adjusts the remaining 1x1 icons (`x`) to fit into the remaining space. The remaining 1x1 icons are calculated as `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, and the number of additional screens needed for these icons is `math.ceil((x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15) + 1`.
     - If only `y` is greater than 0, it directly prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - If only `x` is greater than 0, it prints `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_2()` for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the logic in `func_2()` seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed based on the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The calculations and conditions in `func_2()` align with the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
