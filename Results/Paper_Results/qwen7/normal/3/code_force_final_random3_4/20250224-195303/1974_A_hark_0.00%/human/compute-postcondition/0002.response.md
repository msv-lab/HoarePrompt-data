Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `func_2()` has been called.**

The function call `func_2()` is executed, but since no details about what `func_2()` does are provided, the only changes are that `t` remains an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and the function `func_2()` has been called. No other variables are affected, and the precondition that `t` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) is preserved.
