Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the recursion limit is set to 10 ** 6**.

Explanation: The code sets the recursion limit to \(10^6\) using `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)`. This does not affect the value of `t`, which remains an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, the only change is the updated recursion limit.
