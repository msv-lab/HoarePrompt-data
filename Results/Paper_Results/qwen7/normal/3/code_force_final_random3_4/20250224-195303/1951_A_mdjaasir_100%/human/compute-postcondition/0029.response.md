Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `t`, `a` is an input string, `count` is the number of '1's in `a`**.

Explanation: The code `count = a.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `a` and assigns the count to the variable `count`. The values of `i`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
