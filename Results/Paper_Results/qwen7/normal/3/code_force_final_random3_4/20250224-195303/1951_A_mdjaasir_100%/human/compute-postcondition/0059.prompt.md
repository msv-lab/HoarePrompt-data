Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a string input by the user, and `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If `count` is 0, the postcondition remains as is. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `count` is either 0, 1, or greater than 2 but not even, and if `count` is 2, the character immediately following the first '1' in `a` is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `t`, `a` is an input string, `count` is the number of '1's in `a`. Regardless of whether `count` is 0 or not, the function continues without changing the values of `i`, `t`, `a`, and `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `t`, `a` is a new input string, `count` is the number of '1's in `a`, `n` is an input integer. If `count` is 0, the values of `i`, `t`, `a`, `count`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `count` is not 0, the values of `i`, `t`, `a`, `count`, and `n` also remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
