Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is updated to `i + 1`, but since the initial state only mentions `i` is `i + 1` without specifying the exact value, we keep it as `i + 1`. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input from the user.
