Postcondition: `a` is a string input by the user, count is 2 (the number of '1's in the string `a`), and count is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 2 or not even. If the character immediately following the first '1' in `a` is not '1', the program does nothing. If the character immediately following the first '1' in `a` is '1', the program also does nothing.
