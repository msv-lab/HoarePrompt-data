Postcondition: `cards` is a list of integers with at least one occurrence of the integer `j + 1`. `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` if there is exactly one occurrence of `j + 1` in `cards`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
