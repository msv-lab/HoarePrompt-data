Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is such that for every pair `(i, j)`, `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum value obtained by considering the following conditions:

- If there are no occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- If there is exactly one occurrence of `j + 1` in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- If there are more than one occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

This final state represents the optimal solution for the problem being solved, where `dp[0][0]` would give the maximum possible value achievable under the given constraints.
