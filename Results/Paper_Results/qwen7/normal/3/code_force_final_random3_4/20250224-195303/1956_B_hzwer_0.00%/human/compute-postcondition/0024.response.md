Postcondition: `cards` is a list of integers, `dp[i][1]` is updated based on the following rules: if `cards.count(1 + 1) == 0`, then `dp[i][1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][1]`. Otherwise, `dp[i][1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][1]`, `dp[i + 2][0] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][2]`. Here, `j` is 1 and `n` is 5.
