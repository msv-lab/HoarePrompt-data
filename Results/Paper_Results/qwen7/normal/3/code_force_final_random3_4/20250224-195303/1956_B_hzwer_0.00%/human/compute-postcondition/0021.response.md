Output State: **`dp[i][1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][1]` and `dp[i + 2][0] + 1`, and `n` is 5.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Here, `j` is 1, so the equation simplifies to updating `dp[i][1]` to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][1]` and `dp[i + 2][0] + 1`. The initial state of `n` being 5 remains unchanged. All other variables and their states remain as per the initial state since they are not affected by this line of code.
