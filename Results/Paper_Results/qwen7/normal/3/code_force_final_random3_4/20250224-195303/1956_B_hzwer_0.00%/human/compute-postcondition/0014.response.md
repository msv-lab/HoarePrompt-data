Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. No other variables are affected.**

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is now set to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The precondition that there is no occurrence of `j + 1` in the list `cards` remains unchanged.
