Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1), initialized with 0's. `cards` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.**

The code initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)` where all elements are set to 0. This initialization does not affect the values of `cards`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
