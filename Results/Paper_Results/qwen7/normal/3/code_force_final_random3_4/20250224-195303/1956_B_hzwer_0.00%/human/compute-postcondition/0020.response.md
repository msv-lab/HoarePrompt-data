Output State: **`cards` is a list of integers, `dp[i][1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][1]`, `n` is 5.**

Explanation: The code updates `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Given that `j` is 1, `dp[i][1]` is set to `dp[i + 1][1]`. The initial state of `n` is 5, which remains unchanged. The list `cards` and other unspecified `dp` entries are not affected by this operation.
