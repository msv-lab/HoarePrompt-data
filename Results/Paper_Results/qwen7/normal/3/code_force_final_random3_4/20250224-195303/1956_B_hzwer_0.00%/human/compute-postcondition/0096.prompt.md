Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1), initialized with 0's; `dp[n-1][0]` is 0; `dp[n-2][0]` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
    for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
        elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1]
                )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will be such that `dp[i][0]` contains the maximum value obtained by considering all possible valid sequences of operations based on the conditions given within the loop. Specifically, `dp[i][0]` will reflect the optimal solution for the problem defined by the loop, which involves making decisions based on the count of occurrences of each integer in the `cards` list.

In more detail, `dp[i][0]` will be the result of evaluating the maximum possible value starting from `i` down to `0`, where each step considers whether to include or exclude certain elements from the sequence based on their presence in `cards`. The loop iterates over all relevant indices `j` in reverse order, updating the `dp` table according to the specified rules until it reaches `dp[i][0]`, which encapsulates the best outcome for the entire range.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is such that for every pair `(i, j)`, `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum value obtained by considering the following conditions:

- If there are no occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- If there is exactly one occurrence of `j + 1` in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- If there are more than one occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

This final state represents the optimal solution for the problem being solved, where `dp[0][0]` would give the maximum possible value achievable under the given constraints.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The final state of `dp[i][j]` after the loop executes all its iterations will be determined by the maximum value among the following possibilities for each `i` and `j`:

- `dp[i + 1][j]`: This is the value of `dp[i][j]` from the previous iteration or subproblem.
- `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`: This is considered if `j + 1` exists in the `cards` list exactly once, and it adds 1 to the value of `dp[i + 2][j - 1]`.
- `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`: This is considered if `j + 1` exists in the `cards` list more than once, and it uses the value of `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

The final value of `dp[i][j]` will be the highest of these three values for each `i` and `j` after the loop has completed all its iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
