Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, `j` is `j - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by taking the maximum of two expressions: `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Additionally, the initial state mentions that `j` is `j - 1`, which indicates that `j` has already been decremented by 1 before the code was executed. Therefore, the updated value of `j` is `j - 1`.
