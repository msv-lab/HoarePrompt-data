Postcondition: `cards` is a list of integers, and there is no occurrence of `j + 1` in the list `cards`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. No other variables are affected.
