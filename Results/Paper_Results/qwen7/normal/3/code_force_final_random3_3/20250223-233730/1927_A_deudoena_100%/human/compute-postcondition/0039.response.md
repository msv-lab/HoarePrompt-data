Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in s[::-1]`. The variable `j` is the iterator that takes each character from the reversed string `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `d` is 2.
   - `ma` is the length of the string `s` - 2.
   - `mi` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B'.
   - `c` is the length of the string `s`.
   - The current value of `j` is the second character of the original string `s`.
   - `l` is an empty list.
   - The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the second character of the original string `s`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the reversed string, the next character `j` will be the first character of the original string `s` (because it starts from the last character and moves towards the first).
   - All other variables (`d`, `ma`, `mi`, `m`, `c`, `l`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `d` remains 2.
   - `ma` remains the length of the string `s` - 2.
   - `mi` remains the length of the string `s`.
   - `m` remains the input integer.
   - `s` remains a non-empty string starting with 'B'.
   - `c` remains the length of the string `s`.
   - The current value of `j` is now the first character of the original string `s`.
   - `l` remains an empty list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`d` is 2, `ma` is the length of the string `s` - 2, `mi` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, the current value of `j` is the first character of the original string `s`, `l` is an empty list**.
