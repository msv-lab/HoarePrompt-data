Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make all cells white.
   - Variables `ma` and `mi` are initialized to 0.
   - `m` is read as the length of the strip, and `s` is read as the string representing the strip.
   - Variables `c` and `d` are initialized to 0.
   - Lists `l` is initialized but not used in the current implementation.
   - Two loops are used to find the positions of the first and last black cells:
     - The first loop (`for j in s:`) iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
     - If a black cell ('B') is found, `mi` is set to the count of white cells encountered so far (`c`), and the loop breaks.
     - The second loop (`for j in s[::-1]:`) iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
     - If a black cell ('B') is found, `ma` is set to the distance from the end of the string to the black cell (`len(s) - d`), and the loop breaks.
   - Finally, the function returns `ma - mi + 2`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation:**
   - The logic for finding the minimum length of the segment is flawed.
   - The variable `mi` is set to the count of white cells before the first black cell, which does not correctly represent the position of the first black cell.
   - Similarly, `ma` is set to the distance from the end of the string to the first black cell from the right, which does not correctly represent the position of the last black cell.
   - The formula `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the actual positions of the first and last black cells.

2. **Example Test Cases:**
   - Let's test the program with the provided examples:
     - For the strip "WBBWBW":
       - First black cell is at position 2 (index 1).
       - Last black cell is at position 5 (index 4).
       - The correct answer should be 4, but the program returns 6 (5 - 1 + 2).
     - For the strip "BBW":
       - First black cell is at position 1 (index 0).
       - Last black cell is at position 2 (index 1).
       - The correct answer should be 2, but the program returns 4 (2 - 0 + 2).

### Correct Solution:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the positions of the first and last black cells and calculate the distance between them.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    first_black = s.find('B')
    last_black = s.rfind('B')
    if first_black == -1 or last_black == -1:
        print(m)
    else:
        print(last_black - first_black + 1)
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for calculating the minimum segment length. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
