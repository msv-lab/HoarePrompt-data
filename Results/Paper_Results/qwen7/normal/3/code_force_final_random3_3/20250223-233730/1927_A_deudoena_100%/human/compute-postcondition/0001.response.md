Output State: **`ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `m`. The values of `ma` and `mi` remain unchanged from their initial state, which is 0. The input integer is stored in `m`.
