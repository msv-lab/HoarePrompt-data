Output State: **`ma` is 0, `mi` is 2, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B', `c` is 2, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the second character of `s`**.

Explanation: The code `mi = c` assigns the value of `c` (which is 2) to `mi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
