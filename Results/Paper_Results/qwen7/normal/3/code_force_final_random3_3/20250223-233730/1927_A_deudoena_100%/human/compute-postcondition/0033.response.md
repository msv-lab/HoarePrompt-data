Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j`. This is the only variable that changes within the loop.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the reversed string `s[::-1]`. This means `j` takes each character from the reversed string `s` in sequence.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ma` is the length of the string `s` - 1.
   - `mi` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B'.
   - `c` is the length of the string `s`.
   - The current value of `j` is 'B' (indicating it is the first character of the reversed string).
   - `d` is 1.
   - `l` is an empty list.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**: Since `j` is currently 'B' (the first character of the reversed string), the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]` would be the second character of the original string `s`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `j` will now be the second character of the original string `s`.
   - All other variables (`ma`, `mi`, `m`, `s`, `c`, `d`, `l`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`ma` is the length of the string `s` - 1, `mi` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, the current value of `j` is the second character of the original string `s`, `d` is 1, `l` is an empty list**.
