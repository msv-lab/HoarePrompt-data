Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the black cell ('B') is at the very end of the strip. For example, consider the input:

```
6
WWBBWB
```

According to the problem description, the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white is 3, as painting the last three cells would make the entire strip white. However, the program incorrectly outputs 6, which is the distance from the start to the end of the strip minus the distance from the last black cell to the end. This happens because the program breaks out of the loop as soon as it encounters the first black cell from the start and the last black cell from the end, without considering the possibility of multiple black cells in the middle of the strip.
