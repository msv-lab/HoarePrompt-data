Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(set_)`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(set_)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `A` is True
   - `not_c` is False
   - `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements
   - `i` is 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < len(set_)`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(set_)` must still be greater than `i`, which means `len(set_)` must be at least 2.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `A` remains unchanged: `A` is True
   - `not_c` remains unchanged: `not_c` is False
   - `set_` remains unchanged: `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements
   - `i` is now 2

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`A` is True, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 2**
