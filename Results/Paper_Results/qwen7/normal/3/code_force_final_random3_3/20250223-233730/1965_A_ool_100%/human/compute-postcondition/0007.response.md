Output State: **`A` is False; `not_c` is True; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order. The first element of `set_` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `not_c = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `not_c`. This does not affect the values of `A` or `set_`. Therefore, the initial values of `A` and `set_` remain unchanged, and `not_c` is now `True`.
