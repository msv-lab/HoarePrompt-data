Output State: **`A` is True, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` from `False` to `True`. The values of `not_c`, `set_`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
