Output State: **`A` is False; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `set_.sort()` sorts the list `set_` in ascending order. The initial state of `A` remains unchanged as `False`. The list `set_` is modified to be sorted, but its uniqueness is not guaranteed since sorting does not preserve the uniqueness of elements unless explicitly handled (which is not the case here).
