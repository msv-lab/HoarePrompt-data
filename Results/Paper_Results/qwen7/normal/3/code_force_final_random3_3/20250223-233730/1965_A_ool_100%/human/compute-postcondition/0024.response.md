Output State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `A`, `not_c`, `set_`, and `i`. It only indicates that the execution would exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within, but since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the variables retain their initial states.
