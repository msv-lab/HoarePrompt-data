Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, len(set_))`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `A` is False
   - `not_c` is False
   - `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements
   - `i` is 2

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration where `i` was 2, the next value of `i` would be 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be within the range `1` to `len(set_) - 1`.

5. **Check the Range Condition**:
   - Given `i` is now 3, it must be less than `len(set_)` for the loop to continue.

6. **State Adjustment**:
   - `A` remains False.
   - `not_c` remains False.
   - `set_` remains a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is now 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 3**.
