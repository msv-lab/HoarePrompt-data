Output State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 3 elements, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The variable `A` was initially set to `True`. The code snippet `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to the opposite of its current value. Since `A` was `True`, after executing `A = not A`, `A` becomes `False`. The values of `not_c`, `set_`, and `i` remain unchanged.
