Output State: **`A` is True, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The line `not_c = False` does not affect the values of `A`, `set_`, or `i`. It only changes the value of `not_c` to `False`. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with `not_c` being explicitly set to `False`.
