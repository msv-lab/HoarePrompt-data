Postcondition: `A` is True, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 2. If `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged when the if condition is not met.
