Output State: `A` is False, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 3 elements, and `i` is 3.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `A` alternates between True and False with each iteration. Since the loop starts with `A` as True and alternates, after 3 iterations, `A` will be False. The variable `not_c` remains False because it is set to False during the first iteration and not changed afterward. The variable `set_` contains the unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and since the loop checks up to the third element (as indicated by `i` being 3), `set_` must contain at least 3 elements. The variable `i` will be 3 after the last iteration of the loop.
