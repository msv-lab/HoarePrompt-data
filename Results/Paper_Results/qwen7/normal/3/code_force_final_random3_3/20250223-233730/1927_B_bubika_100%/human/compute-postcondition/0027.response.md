Output State: **`r` is increased by `a[x]`, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input that must not be empty, `x` is the index of `i` in list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `r += a[x]` increments the value of `r` by the value of `a[x]`. The values of `s` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
