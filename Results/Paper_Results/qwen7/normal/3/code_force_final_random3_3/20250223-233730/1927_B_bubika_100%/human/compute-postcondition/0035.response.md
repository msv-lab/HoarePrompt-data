Output State: **`r` is `r + a[x] + 1 + a[x]`, `s` is a list of integers, `x` is the index of `i` in list `b`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, and `i` is the next element in the list `s`.**

Explanation: The code `r += a[x]` increments `r` by the value of `a[x]`. The initial state had `r` as `r + a[x] + 1`, so after the code execution, `r` becomes `r + a[x] + 1 + a[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
