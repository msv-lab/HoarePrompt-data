To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `r` is the sum of `2 * a[x] + 2` for each element `i` in `s`.
   - `b[x]` is increased by the count of occurrences of `i` in `s`.
   - `i` is the last element in the list `s`.

2. **Operations**:
   - We need to calculate the value of `r` based on the formula `2 * a[x] + 2` for each element `i` in `s`.
   - For each element `i` in `s`, `b[x]` is incremented by the count of occurrences of `i` in `s`.
   - `i` is the last element in the list `s`.

3. **Calculation of `r`**:
   - Since `r` is the sum of `2 * a[x] + 2` for each element `i` in `s`, we need to know the value of `a[x]` and the elements in `s`.
   - Without the explicit values of `a[x]` and `s`, we can only express `r` in terms of these variables.

4. **Calculation of `b[x]`**:
   - `b[x]` is increased by the count of occurrences of each element `i` in `s`.
   - This means if there are multiple occurrences of `i` in `s`, `b[x]` will be incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `s`.

5. **Value of `i`**:
   - `i` is the last element in the list `s`.

Given the above, since the exact values of `a[x]` and `s` are not provided, we can only express `r` in terms of these variables.

Output: **r (where r is the sum of 2 * a[x] + 2 for each element i in s)**
