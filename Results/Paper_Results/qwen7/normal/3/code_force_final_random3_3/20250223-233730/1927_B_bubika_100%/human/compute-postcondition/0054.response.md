Output State: **`i` is the first element in `s`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is 'a[x]' appended to the previous value, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input with its elements cycled, `t` is incremented by 1, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.**

Explanation: The code `x = b.index(i)` assigns the index of `i` in the list `b` to the variable `x`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, `s`, `t`, and `x` are updated as described.
