Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `r` is '', `b[x]` is increased by the count of occurrences of `i` in `s`, `i` is the last element in the list `s`, and `t` is incremented by 1; `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b[x]` is increased by 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `i` is the last element in the list `s`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is 'a[x]' appended to the previous value, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `t` is incremented by 1, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a list of 26 zeros except for the element at index `x` which is now 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `r` is 'a[x]' appended to the previous value, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input with its elements cycled, `t` is incremented by 1, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 'a[x]'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is 'a[x]' appended to the previous value of `r`, `i` is the first element in `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input with its elements cycled, `t` is incremented by 1, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
