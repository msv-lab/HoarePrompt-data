Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `arr` of `n` integers (each integer in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9). It sorts the list `arr` and then creates a new list `new_arr` by appending elements from the ends of `arr` towards the center, resulting in `new_arr` containing all elements of `arr` in reverse order. Finally, it calculates `max_beauty` as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to `left + 1` in `new_arr`, where `left` is `n - 1`, and returns `max_beauty`. The values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged after the function execution.**
