Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` must be greater than or equal to 1, `new_arr` contains the element `arr[1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `left` of `arr` to `new_arr`. Initially, `left` is 1, so `new_arr.append(arr[left])` appends `arr[1]` to `new_arr`. After this operation, `left` is incremented to 2 (though not explicitly shown in the given code snippet, it is implied by the problem's context that `left` would be incremented after appending), and `right` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
