Output State: `max_beauty` is increased by the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to `left + 1` in the `new_arr` list, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is equal to `left + 1`, and the values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged.

To break it down further:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1` (where `n` is initially `left + 1`), adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]` to `max_beauty`.
- After all iterations, `max_beauty` will contain the total sum of these absolute differences.
- The values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
- `i` will be equal to `n` after the last iteration, which is `left + 1`.
- `n` will also be equal to `left + 1` after the loop completes.
