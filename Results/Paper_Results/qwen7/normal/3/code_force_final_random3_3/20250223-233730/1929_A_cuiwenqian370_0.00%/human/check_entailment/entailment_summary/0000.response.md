Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`.
- The given solution first sorts the array `arr`.
- It then constructs a new array `new_arr` by appending elements from the end of the sorted array to the start, effectively reversing the order of the elements.
- This approach aims to maximize the differences between consecutive elements in the new array.
- After constructing `new_arr`, it calculates the maximum beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements starting from the second element to the last element.
- The logic of sorting and then reversing the array is correct because it ensures that the largest and smallest elements are placed at opposite ends, maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.

Given the execution summary, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described above. Therefore, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
