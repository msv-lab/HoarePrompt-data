Output State: **`left` is 3, `right` is 1, and `new_arr` contains either the element from `arr` at index 0 (if `left` is 1) or the elements `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` (if `left` is 2).**

Explanation: The code `right -= 1` decrements the value of `right` by 1. Given that `right` was initially at least 2, after decrementing, `right` becomes 1. The values of `left` and `new_arr` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
