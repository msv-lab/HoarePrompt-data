Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` is 0; if `left` equals `right`, then `new_arr` contains the element `arr[1]`; otherwise, `new_arr` contains the elements `arr[0]` and `arr[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `right -= 1` decrements the value of `right` by 1. Given that `right` was initially greater than or equal to 1, after decrementing, `right` becomes 0. The conditions for `new_arr` remain unchanged because the code only affects `right`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `right` and maintains the original conditions for `new_arr`.
