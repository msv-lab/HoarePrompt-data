Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. This means we want to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty of the array.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function sorts the array `arr`.
   - It creates a new array `new_arr` where the smallest and largest elements are alternated to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
   - Finally, it calculates the beauty of the new array by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest values are placed at the extremes, maximizing the differences.
   - Alternating the smallest and largest values (starting with the smallest) ensures that the differences are maximized.
   - Summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array gives the maximum possible beauty.

Given this analysis, the code appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
