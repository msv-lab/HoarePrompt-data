Output State: **`arr` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is n - 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `right`. The initial values of `arr`, `new_arr`, and `left` remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `new_arr` is still an empty list, and `left` is still 0. The new value of `right` is `n - 1`.
