Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` is n - 1.**

Explanation: The variable `left` was initially set to 0. After executing `left += 1`, `left` is incremented by 1, making its new value 1. The value of `right` remains unchanged at `n - 1`. All other variables and their states remain as per the initial conditions.
