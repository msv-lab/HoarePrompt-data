Output State: **`arr` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `new_arr` is a list containing one element which is the integer at index 0 of `arr`, `left` is 0, `right` is n - 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at the current position of `left` (which is also equal to `right`) to `new_arr`. Since `left` was initially equal to `right`, `new_arr` now contains the element at index 0 of `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
