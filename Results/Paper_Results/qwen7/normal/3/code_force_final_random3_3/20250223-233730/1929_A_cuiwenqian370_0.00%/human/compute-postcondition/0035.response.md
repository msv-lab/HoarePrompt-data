Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - From the given state, we know `left` is `n - 1`.
   - We also know `right` is 1.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `1` to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and goes up to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts at `1` and the loop will run until `i` is less than `n`, we need to ensure that `i` is within this range.
   - Given that `left` is `n - 1`, we can infer that `n` is `left + 1`, which means `n = (left + 1)`.
   - Therefore, `i` should start at `1` and go up to `n - 1`.

5. **State adjustment**:
   - `i` should be `1` at the start of the loop.
   - `n` should be `left + 1`.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed are:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is `left + 1`**
