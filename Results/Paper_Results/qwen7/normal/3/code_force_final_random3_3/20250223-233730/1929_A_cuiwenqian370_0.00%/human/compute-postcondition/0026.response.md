Output State: **`left` is 2; `right` must be at least 2; `new_arr` contains the element `arr[right]`**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `right` of array `arr` to the list `new_arr`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `arr`, the only thing we know for certain is that `new_arr` now includes the element from `arr` at the `right` index. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
