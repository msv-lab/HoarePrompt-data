### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The beauty is maximized when the largest elements are paired with the smallest elements.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Sorting**: The array `arr` is sorted.
   - **Reversing Elements**: The function creates a new array `new_arr` by appending elements from the ends of `arr` towards the center. This results in `new_arr` containing all elements of `arr` in reverse order.
   - **Calculating Beauty**: The function then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

3. **Key Points in the Annotated Code**:
   - **State Before Loop**: `left` is 0, `right` is `n - 1`, and `new_arr` is empty.
   - **Loop Execution**: The loop appends elements from the ends of `arr` towards the center, resulting in `new_arr` containing all elements of `arr` in reverse order.
   - **State After Loop**: `left` is `n - 1`, `right` is 1, and `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order.
   - **Beauty Calculation**: The loop iterates through `new_arr` and calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are placed at the appropriate positions.
   - Reversing the sorted array places the largest elements at the beginning and the smallest elements at the end, maximizing the sum of absolute differences.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     4
     10 5 1 20
     ```
   - After sorting, `arr` becomes `[1, 5, 10, 20]`.
   - Reversing gives `new_arr` as `[20, 10, 5, 1]`.
   - Calculating the beauty:
     \[
     (20 - 10) + (10 - 5) + (5 - 1) = 10 + 5 + 4 = 19
     \]
   - This matches the expected output, confirming that the approach is correct.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly rearranges the array to maximize the beauty as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
