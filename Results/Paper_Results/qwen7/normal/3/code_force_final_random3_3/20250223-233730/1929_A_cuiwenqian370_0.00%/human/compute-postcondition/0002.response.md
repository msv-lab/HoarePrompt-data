Output State: **`arr` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `left` to 0. The lists `arr` and `new_arr` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `arr` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `new_arr` remains an empty list, and `left` is set to 0.
