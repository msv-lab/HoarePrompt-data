Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` must be at least 2, `new_arr` contains the element from `arr` at index 0**

Explanation: The code appends the element at the `left` index of `arr` to `new_arr`. Initially, `left` is 2, so the element at index 2 of `arr` is appended to `new_arr`. After appending, `left` is decremented by 1 (since the next operation would be for `left+1`), making it 1. The condition for `right` remains unchanged, so it must still be at least 2.
