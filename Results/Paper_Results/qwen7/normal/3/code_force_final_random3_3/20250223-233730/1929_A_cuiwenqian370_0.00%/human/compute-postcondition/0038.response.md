Output State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[2]` and `new_arr[1]`, `i` is 3, `n` is `left + 1`.**

Explanation: The code increments `max_beauty` by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, the absolute difference is calculated between `new_arr[2]` and `new_arr[1]`. The value of `i` is updated to 3, and `n` remains as `left + 1`.
