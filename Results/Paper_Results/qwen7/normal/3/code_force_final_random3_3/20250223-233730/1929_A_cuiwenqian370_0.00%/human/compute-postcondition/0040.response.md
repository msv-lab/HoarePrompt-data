Output State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[4]` and `new_arr[3]`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**

Explanation: The code updates `max_beauty` by adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 4, `new_arr[i]` is `new_arr[4]` and `new_arr[i - 1]` is `new_arr[3]`. Therefore, `max_beauty` is increased by `abs(new_arr[4] - new_arr[3])`. The value of `i` remains 4, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 4 is still valid.
