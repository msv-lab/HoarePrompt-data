Output State: **`left` is 1; `right` must be greater than or equal to 1; `new_arr` contains the elements `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `arr[left]` to `new_arr`. Initially, `new_arr` contains the element `arr[right]`. After appending `arr[left]` to `new_arr`, `new_arr` now contains both `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
