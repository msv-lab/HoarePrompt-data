### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the road are satisfied.
   - The satisfaction condition is checked using the formula:
     - For the left side: At least \(\lceil \frac{i}{2} \rceil\) zeros.
     - For the right side: At least \(\lceil \frac{n-i}{2} \rceil\) ones.
   - We also need to ensure that the chosen position `i` minimizes \( \left| \frac{n}{2} - i \right| \).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code defines a function `func_1()` to solve the problem for a single test case.
   - It reads the number of houses `n` and the binary string `a`.
   - It calculates the cumulative counts of zeros and ones up to each house using a list `S`.
   - It iterates through each possible position `i` from 0 to `n` to check the satisfaction conditions.
   - For each `i`, it calculates the number of zeros (`left`) and ones (`right`) on the left and right sides, respectively.
   - It checks if the conditions for satisfaction are met and updates the answer `ans` if the current `i` is better than the previous `ans`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly calculates the cumulative counts of zeros and ones.
   - It correctly checks the satisfaction conditions for each possible position `i`.
   - It updates the answer `ans` to the position that minimizes \( \left| \frac{n}{2} - i \right| \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where the road can be placed before the first house (`i=0`).
   - The code correctly handles the case where no position satisfies the conditions by initializing `ans` to `-1` and updating it when a valid position is found.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The code correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position `i` for placing the road.
   - It handles all the required conditions and edge cases.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code provides a detailed step-by-step explanation of the program's state at key points.
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly calculates the cumulative counts and checks the satisfaction conditions.
   - The annotations also show that the answer `ans` is updated correctly to minimize \( \left| \frac{n}{2} - i \right| \).

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the code and the annotated version, the program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position `i` for placing the road. It handles all the required conditions and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
