Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n - i` to the variable `rsum`. The values of `n`, `left`, `lsum`, and `right` remain unchanged from their initial states.
