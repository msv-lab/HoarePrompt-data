Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides are satisfied. This means that for the left side, the number of '0's (residents wanting to live on the left) should be at least \(\lceil \frac{i}{2} \rceil\), and for the right side, the number of '1's (residents wanting to live on the right) should be at least \(\lceil \frac{n-i}{2} \rceil\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: 
     - It calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each house.
     - It then iterates through all possible positions `i` to check if placing the road at position `i` satisfies the conditions.
     - If the conditions are met, it updates the answer to the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference \(|n/2 - i|\).
   - **func_2()**: 
     - It handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.
     - The loop ensures that `func_1()` is called for each test case.

3. **Execution States**:
   - The code correctly initializes the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
   - It iterates through all possible positions and checks the conditions.
   - The logic for updating the answer based on the conditions and minimizing the absolute difference is correctly implemented.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge cases where the entire village is on one side (all '0's or all '1's).
   - It correctly identifies the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference from the center of the village.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
