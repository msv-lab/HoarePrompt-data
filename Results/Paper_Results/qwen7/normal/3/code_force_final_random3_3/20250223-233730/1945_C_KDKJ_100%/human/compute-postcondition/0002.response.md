Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
     - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
     - `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.
     - `func_1()` has been called.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0. After each iteration, the value of `int(input())` decreases by 1.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since it was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be exactly 0 now.
   - Therefore, `int(input())` will be 0 for the next iteration.

5. **Update the State:**
   - The state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
   - `func_1()` has already been called, so it does not change.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `func_1()` has been called, `int(input())` is 0.**
