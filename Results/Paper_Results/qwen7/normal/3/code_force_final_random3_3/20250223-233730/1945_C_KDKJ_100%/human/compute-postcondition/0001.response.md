Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', `func_1()` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no specific implementation of `func_1()` is provided, we cannot determine any changes to the variables `n` or `a`. The only thing we know for certain is that `func_1()` has been executed.
