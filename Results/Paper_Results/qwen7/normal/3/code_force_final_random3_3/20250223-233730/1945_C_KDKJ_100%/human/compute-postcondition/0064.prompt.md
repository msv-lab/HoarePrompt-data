Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of an empty string (which is undefined), `x` is the last character of an empty string plus 1 (which is 1), `y` is the last character of an empty string plus 2 (which is 2), `S` is a list containing the elements [[1, 2], [1, 2]], `ans` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = i
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - i
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`; if the condition `(left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum)` holds true, the loop continues. Otherwise, the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` holds true, and if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, `ans` remains unchanged; otherwise, `ans` is set to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`. If the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, `ans` is either unchanged or updated to `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`. If the condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` is true, `ans` remains unchanged or is updated based on the condition; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is smaller than the current `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
