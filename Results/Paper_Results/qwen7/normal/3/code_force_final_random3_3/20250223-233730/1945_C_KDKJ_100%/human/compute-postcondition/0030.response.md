Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]` to the variable `right`. The other variables (`n`, `left`, and `lsum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
