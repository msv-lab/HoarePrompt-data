Postcondition: `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`; the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` holds true; if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged; otherwise, `ans` is set to `i`.
