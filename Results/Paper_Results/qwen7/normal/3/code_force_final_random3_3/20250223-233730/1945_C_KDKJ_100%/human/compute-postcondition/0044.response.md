Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i+1][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The line `lsum = i` updates the value of `lsum` to be equal to `i`. All other variables (`n`, `left`, `right`, and `rsum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
