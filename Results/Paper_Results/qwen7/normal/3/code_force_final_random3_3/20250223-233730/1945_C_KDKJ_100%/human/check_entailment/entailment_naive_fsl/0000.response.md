Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program uses a different approach to calculate the number of zeros and ones on either side of the road, which does not align with the problem description.

The problem requires checking whether at least \(\lceil \frac{i}{2} \rceil\) zeros are on the left side and \(\lceil \frac{n-i}{2} \rceil\) ones are on the right side for each possible position \(i\). However, the program calculates the cumulative counts of zeros and ones without properly checking these conditions.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
101
```

The program should output `2` because:
- If the road is placed after the first house, there is 1 zero on the left side, but \(\lceil \frac{1}{2} \rceil = 1\), so it satisfies the condition.
- If the road is placed after the second house, there is 1 zero on the left side and 1 one on the right side, both satisfying \(\lceil \frac{2}{2} \rceil = 1\) and \(\lceil \frac{1}{2} \rceil = 1\).
- If the road is placed after the third house, there are 2 zeros on the left side, but \(\lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2\), so it satisfies the condition.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the cumulative counts and does not properly check the conditions. For the input `101`, the program outputs `2`, which is correct, but for other inputs, it might fail to correctly identify the optimal position.

A corrected version of the program would involve directly checking the conditions for each position \(i\) as described in the problem statement.
