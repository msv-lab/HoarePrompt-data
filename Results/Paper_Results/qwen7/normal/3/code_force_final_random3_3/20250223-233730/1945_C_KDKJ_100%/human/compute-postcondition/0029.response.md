Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `lsum` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of `n` and `left` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes these updated values for the variables involved.
