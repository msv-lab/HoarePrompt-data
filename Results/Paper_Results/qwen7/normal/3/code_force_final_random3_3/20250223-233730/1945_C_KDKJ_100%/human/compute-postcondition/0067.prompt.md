You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of houses, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side of the street, and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side of the street.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        x, y = S[-1]
        
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        
        S.append([x, y])
        
    #State: `a` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `a`, `x` is the last character of `a` plus 1, `y` is the last character of `a` plus 2, `S` is a list containing the elements `[x, y], [x, y]` appended.
    ans = -1
    for i in range(n + 1):
        left = S[i][0]
        
        lsum = i
        
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        
        rsum = n - i
        
        if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
            continue
        elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
            ans = i
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`; `ans` is the value of `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` while satisfying the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `ans` will hold the value of `i` that satisfies the conditions within the loop and minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`. The values of `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` will be as defined in each iteration of the loop, but they will not affect the final value of `ans`. The other variables (`a`, `s`, `x`, `y`, and `S`) will retain their initial or unchanged states from the beginning of the loop.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the value of i that minimizes |n/2 - i| and satisfies left * 2 >= lsum and right * 2 >= rsum)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of houses, and `a`, a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The function returns whether it's possible to satisfy all residents' preferences for living on either the left or right side of the street.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
