Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `j` is `n-3`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros except for `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0, `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.**

The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. However, since the exact values of `i`, `j`, and the structure of `dp` are not specified beyond the initial conditions, the only specific change is the update rule applied to `dp[i][j]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
