Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1), filled with zeros; `dp[n-1][0]` is 0; `dp[n-2][0]` is 0; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

The code `dp[n - 2][0] = 0` sets the value of `dp[n-2][0]` to 0. This updates the 2D list `dp` at the position `(n-2, 0)` to 0. All other values remain unchanged according to the initial state.
