Output State: **`i` is either `n-5` or `n-4`, `j` is `0`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `cards` list remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of three possible values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. Since `j` is `0`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1]` would refer to `dp[i + 2][-1]`, which is not defined in the 2D list `dp` (assuming the indices start from `0`). Therefore, the valid options are `dp[i + 1][0]` and `dp[i + 1][1]`. However, since `j` is `0`, the term `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` is not applicable, and the expression simplifies to `max(dp[i + 1][0], dp[i + 1][1])`. The values of `i`, `j`, `t`, `n`, and the `cards` list remain unchanged.
