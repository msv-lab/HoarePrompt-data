Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1), filled with zeros; `dp[n-1][0]` is 0; `dp[n-2][0]` is 0; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers; `j` is `n-1`; `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is now set to the maximum of three values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
