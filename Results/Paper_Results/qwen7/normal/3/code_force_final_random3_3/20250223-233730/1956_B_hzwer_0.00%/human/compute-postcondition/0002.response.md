Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1), filled with zeros. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

The code initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)` and fills it with zeros. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `cards` remains as a list of integers obtained from the input.
