Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is defined in the loop head.
   - The loop runs in reverse from `n-3` to `0`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = n-3` and decrements by 1 until `i = 0`.
   - Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be `n-3`.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`dp`, `t`, `n`, `cards`) are not directly involved in the loop condition or the loop itself. They remain unchanged within the loop.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute correctly is the initial value of `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n-3`, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1), filled with zeros; `dp[n-1][0]` is 0; `dp[n-2][0]` is 0; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**
