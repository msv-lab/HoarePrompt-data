Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1), filled with zeros; `dp[n-1][0]` is 0; `dp[n-2][0]` is 0; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
    for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
        elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1]
                )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The variable `i` remains `n-3`, `j` becomes `-1` after the loop completes since the loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0`. The `dp` table, which is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros, will have been updated based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, for each cell `dp[i][j]`, it will hold the maximum value determined by the conditions given in the loop body. The `t` and `n` variables remain unchanged, with `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`. The `cards` list also remains unchanged, being a list of integers derived from the input.

The final state of `dp` will reflect the optimal solution for the problem defined by the loop, considering the counts of each card value in the `cards` list and updating the `dp` table accordingly for all possible values of `i` and `j` until `j` reaches `-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically, for each cell `dp[i][j]`, it is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` depending on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list also remains unchanged.

This final state represents the complete execution of the loop where `i` starts from `n-4` and decreases to `0`, and `j` starts from `n-1` and decreases to `0`. The `dp` table is fully populated with the maximum values calculated according to the given conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list also remains unchanged. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `i` is 1, then `dp[1][0]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[2][0]`, `dp[3][-1] + 1` (if `-1` is a valid index, otherwise it would be out of bounds), and `dp[2][1]` if `cards.count(1) != 0`; otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
