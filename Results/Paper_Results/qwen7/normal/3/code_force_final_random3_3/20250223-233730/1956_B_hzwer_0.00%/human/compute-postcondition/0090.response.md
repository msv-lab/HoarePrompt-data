Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is `n-3`; `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; the `cards` list remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of two values: `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Since `i` can only be 0 or 1, `i + 1` will be 1 or 2, and `i + 2` will be 2 or 3. However, since `j` is `n-3`, `j - 1` will be `n-4`. The states of `t`, `n`, and the `cards` list remain unchanged.
