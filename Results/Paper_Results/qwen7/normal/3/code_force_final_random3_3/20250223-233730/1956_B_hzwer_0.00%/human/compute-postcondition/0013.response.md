Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1), filled with zeros except `dp[n-1][0]` is 0 and `dp[n-2][0]` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `j` is `n-1`, `dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of two values: `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. However, since `i` and `j` are set to `n-3` and `n-1` respectively, and given the dimensions of the `dp` array, the specific value of `dp[i][j]` depends on the values of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
