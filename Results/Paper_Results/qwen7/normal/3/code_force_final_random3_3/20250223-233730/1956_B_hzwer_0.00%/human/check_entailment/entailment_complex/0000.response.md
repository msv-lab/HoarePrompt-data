### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of integers `cards`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization:**
   - A 2D list `dp` of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` is initialized to store the maximum points that can be obtained.
   - The base cases `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` are set to 0, which is correct since if there are no remaining cards to choose from, no points can be obtained.

3. **Dynamic Programming Transition:**
   - The nested loops iterate backward through the indices `i` and `j` to fill the `dp` table.
   - For each cell `dp[i][j]`, the code checks the count of the card value `j + 1` in the `cards` list.
     - If the count is 0, the value is copied from the next row (`dp[i + 1][j]`).
     - If the count is 1, the value is either taken from the next row (`dp[i + 1][j]`) or from the cell two steps ahead with one less point (`dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`), whichever is greater.
     - If the count is 2, the value is either taken from the next row (`dp[i + 1][j]`), from the cell two steps ahead with one less point (`dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`), or from the cell one step ahead with one more point (`dp[i + 1][j + 1]`), whichever is greater.

4. **Final Result:**
   - The value `dp[0][0]` is returned, which represents the maximum points that can be obtained by optimally choosing cards.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic correctly models the game scenario where Nene always chooses optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.
- The dynamic programming approach ensures that the maximum points are computed efficiently by considering all possible moves and their outcomes.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly computes the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally.

### Correctness:
**True**
