Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will have `i` equal to `-1`, `j` equal to `0`, and `dp` being a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element `dp[i][j]` is filled with the maximum value calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop body. Specifically, `dp[-1][0]` will contain the final result of the dynamic programming computation. The values of `t` and `n` will remain unchanged, and the `cards` list will also remain as it was initially.

This final state represents the optimal solution to the problem being solved by the dynamic programming approach implemented in the loop, where `dp[i][j]` captures the maximum value achievable under the given constraints as `i` and `j` iterate through their respective ranges.
