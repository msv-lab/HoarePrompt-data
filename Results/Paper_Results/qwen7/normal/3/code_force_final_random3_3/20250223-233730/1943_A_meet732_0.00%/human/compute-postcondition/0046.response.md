Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is now a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `cntl` remains the same**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged, and `cntl` also remains the same.
