Output State: `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the element `i` appears in the list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element is 0 except for those indices that appear in the list `a`, which will have their respective counts stored in `cntl`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cntl[i]` will hold the frequency count of how many times each integer `i` from the list `a` appears. The other variables (`n`, `t`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states, with `n` being the length of `cntl` minus one, `t` being a positive integer within the specified range, and `a` being the list of integers provided as input.
