Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is decremented by 1.
- The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
- Either `c` is `False` or `j` equals `n`.
- In both cases, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `j`**: The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been the highest value it reached, which is `n`.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `1` to `n + 1`. Since `n` is decremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `n` is `n - 1`.
3. **Condition for Loop Continuation**: The loop will continue if `j` is less than `n + 1`.

### Adjusting the States
- **`n`**: Since `n` is decremented by 1, the new value of `n` is `n - 1`.
- **`j`**: At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be set to `1` (the initial value of the range).

### New State
Given the above analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` is `n - 1`, `j` is `1`**.

Since the other variables (`cntl[j]`, `c`) are not directly modified by the loop head and their values are not specified to change based on the loop head alone, they remain unchanged.

So, the final state is:
State: **`n` is `n - 1`, `j` is `1`**.
