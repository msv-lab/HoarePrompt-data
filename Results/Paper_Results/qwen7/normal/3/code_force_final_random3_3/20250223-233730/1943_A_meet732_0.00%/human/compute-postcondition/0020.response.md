Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `cntl[j]` is less than 1, but since `j` is 1, this means `cntl[1]` is less than 1.
- Either `c` is False or `j` is equal to `n`. Since `j` is 1, this condition does not provide additional information about `c` or `n`.

The print statement is simply printing the value of `j`, which is explicitly given as 1.

Output: **1**
