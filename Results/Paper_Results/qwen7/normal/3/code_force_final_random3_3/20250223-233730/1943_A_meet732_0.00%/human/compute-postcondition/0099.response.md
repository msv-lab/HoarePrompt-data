Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is iterating over the elements of the list `a`.
   - The loop does not directly modify `a`, but it does modify `cntl[a[0]]`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `cntl[a[0]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`.
   - For each iteration, `cntl[a[0]]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `a` is a non-empty list, there will always be at least one element to iterate over.
   - After the first iteration, `a` will still be a non-empty list, and `cntl[a[0]]` will be incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `a` must still be a non-empty list, and `cntl[a[0]]` must be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

5. **Update the States:**
   - `a` remains a non-empty list.
   - `cntl[a[0]]` is incremented by 1 again for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `cntl[a[0]]` is incremented by 1**
