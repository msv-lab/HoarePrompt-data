Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in a:`. The only variable in this loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer that must have at least one element.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be a valid element in `a`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to update `i` to the next element in the list `a`. 

5. **Check the list `a`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one of the elements in `a`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next element in `a`.

6. **Update the state**: After processing one element `i` from the list `a`, the next element in the list `a` will be the new value of `i`.

Given these steps, the updated state for the next iteration would be:

- `t` remains the same since it is not involved in the loop.
- `n` remains the same since it is not involved in the loop.
- `a` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
- `cntl` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` is now the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer that must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 1, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**.
