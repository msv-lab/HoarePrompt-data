Output State: **`cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `cntl[a[0]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Initially, `cntl[a[0]]` was incremented by 1. Now, `cntl[i]` is also incremented by 1. The initial state of `cntl[a[0]]` being incremented by 1 remains valid.
