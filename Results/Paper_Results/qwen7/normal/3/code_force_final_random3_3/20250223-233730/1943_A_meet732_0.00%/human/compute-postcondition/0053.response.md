Output State: **`cntl[i]` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `t` is a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element is 0 except for `cntl[i]` which is 3, `i` is the next element of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Initially, `cntl[i]` was 2. After executing `cntl[i] += 1`, the value of `cntl[i]` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
