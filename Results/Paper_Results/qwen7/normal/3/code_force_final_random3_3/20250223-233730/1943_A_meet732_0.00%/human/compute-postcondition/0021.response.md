Output State: **`j` is 1, `cntl[j]` is less than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `j` and `cntl[j]` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables.
