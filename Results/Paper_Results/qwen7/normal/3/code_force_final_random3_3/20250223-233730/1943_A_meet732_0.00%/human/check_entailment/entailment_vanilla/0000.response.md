Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program uses a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`. This is done correctly using `cntl[i] += 1` for each element `i` in `a`.

3. **Initial MEX Calculation:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, the program prints `0`, which is correct since the MEX of an array containing only positive numbers is `0`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the initial value of `c` as `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is also correct because Alice can always pick `0` at least twice if there are enough `0`s.

4. **Adjusting MEX Value:**
   - The program then iterates through the counts from `1` to `n` and decrements `c` for each element that appears less than 2 times.
   - If `c` becomes `0` or the loop reaches the end of the `cntl` list, it prints the current index `j`.

### Verification Against Test Cases

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `4` followed by `0 0 1 1`
   - `cntl` will be `[2, 2, 0, 0]`
   - `c` is set to `2` initially.
   - Since `cntl[1]` is `2`, no decrement happens.
   - Since `c` remains `2`, the program prints `2`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `4` followed by `0 1 2 3`
   - `cntl` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `c` is set to `1` initially.
   - Since `cntl[1]` is `1`, `c` is decremented to `0`.
   - The program prints `1`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `2` followed by `1 1`
   - `cntl` will be `[0, 2]`
   - `c` is set to `0` initially.
   - The program prints `0`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the optimal MEX value based on the given rules and constraints. It handles all provided test cases accurately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
