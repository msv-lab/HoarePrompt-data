Postcondition: `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the element `i` appears in the list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers, and `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element is 0. After executing the loop, each element `cntl[i]` in the list `cntl` represents the count of how many times the index `i` appears in the list `a`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
