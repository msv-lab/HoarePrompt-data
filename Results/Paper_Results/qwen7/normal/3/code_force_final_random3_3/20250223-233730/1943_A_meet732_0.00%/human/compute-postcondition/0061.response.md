Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `j` initialized to 1 (since `range(1, n + 1)` means `j` starts from 1).
   - The value of `n` is not specified in the given state, but it must be such that the loop can execute.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Since `j` starts at 1, the loop will definitely execute at least once as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 so that the loop can execute at least once.
   - The value of `j` is not relevant for the loop to execute, as it will start from 1 and increment within the loop.

5. **Consider the state of `cntl[0]` and `c`**:
   - The values of `cntl[0]` and `c` are not directly relevant to the loop execution itself. However, they might affect the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust them specifically for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
