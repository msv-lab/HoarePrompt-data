The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cntl[i]` is 1, so after the increment, `cntl[i]` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `cntl[i]` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `t` is now a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element is 0 except for `cntl[i]` which is 2, `i` is the second element of the list `a`.

Output State: **`cntl[i]` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `t` is now a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element is 0 except for `cntl[i]` which is 2, `i` is the second element of the list `a`.**
