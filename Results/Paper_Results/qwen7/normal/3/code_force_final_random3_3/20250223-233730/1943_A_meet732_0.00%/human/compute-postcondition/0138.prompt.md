Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. It is also given that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                c -= 1
                if not c or j == n:
                    print(j)
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is equal to the count of occurrences of the index value (i.e., `i`) in the list `a`. If `cntl[0] == 0`, then the first element of `cntl` remains 0. Otherwise, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `j` is 4 and the variable `c` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the element `i` appears in the list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers, and after executing the if-else block, each element `cntl[i]` in the list `cntl` represents the count of how many times the index `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the counts remain unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 3, `j` is set to 3, and `c` is decreased by 3 (if `c` was initially at least 3); the loop breaks if `c` is reduced to 0 or less, or if `j` equals `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the if-else block executes, `cntl[0]` represents the frequency of the integer 0 in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, `cntl[0]` is decremented by `2 * n` and `c` is set to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0] - (2 * n)`. The loop continues until `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n + 1`. In either case, `j` will be `n + 1`, and `cntl[i]` for all `i` will still represent the frequency of the integer `i` in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
