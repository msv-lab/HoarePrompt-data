Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is equal to the count of occurrences of the index value (i.e., `i`) in the list `a`. The first element of `cntl` is 0.**
