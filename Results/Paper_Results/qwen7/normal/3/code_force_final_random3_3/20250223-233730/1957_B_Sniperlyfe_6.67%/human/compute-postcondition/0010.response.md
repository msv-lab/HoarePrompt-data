Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is equal to `n`; `k` is reduced to 0; `n` remains a positive integer as it was initially; `nums` is a list where each element from `nums[0]` to `nums[n-1]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This means every element in the `nums` list will be the largest number that can be represented with `k.bit_length() - 1` bits, subtracted by 1. Since `k` is reduced to 0, the subtraction operation inside the loop no longer affects `k` once `i` reaches `n`.
