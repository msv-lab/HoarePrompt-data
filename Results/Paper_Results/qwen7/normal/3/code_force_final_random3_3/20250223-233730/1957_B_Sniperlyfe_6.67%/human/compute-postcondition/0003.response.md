Output State: **`i` is 1; `k` is `k - (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`; `n` must be a positive integer; `nums` is a list with its first element set to (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 0.
- The code `k -= nums[i]` subtracts the value of `nums[i]` from `k`.
- Since `i` is 0, `nums[i]` is the first element of the list `nums`, which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- After the subtraction, `i` is incremented by 1 due to the nature of list indexing in Python, making `i` equal to 1.
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
- The conditions and values of `n` and `nums` remain unchanged.
