You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `k` is equal to 0; `n` is a positive integer; `nums` is a list where every element from index 0 to `n-1` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `k` has been reduced to 0 after subtracting the necessary values for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the original value of `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The variable `k` will be 0 because it has been fully decremented by the operations within the loop. The list `nums` will contain `n` elements, each set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to the highest power of 2 less than `k` when `k` was originally set, ensuring that `k` is reduced to 0 through these operations.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where the first `n-1` elements are all set to `0`, and the last element is `0`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. It returns a list `nums` where the first `n-1` elements are set to `0`, and the last element is `0`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `nums` where the first `n-1` elements are all set to `0`, and the last element is `0`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
