The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to the highest power of 2 less than `k`. After setting the initial values, it ensures the last element of `nums` is adjusted to make `k` equal to 0. Finally, it returns a list `nums` where the first `n-1` elements are `0`, and the last element is `0`.
