Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `k` is equal to 0; `n` is a positive integer; `nums` is a list where every element from index 0 to `n-1` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `k` has been reduced to 0 after subtracting the necessary values for each iteration of the loop.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the original value of `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The variable `k` will be 0 because it has been fully decremented by the operations within the loop. The list `nums` will contain `n` elements, each set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to the highest power of 2 less than `k` when `k` was originally set, ensuring that `k` is reduced to 0 through these operations.
