Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an integer from input.
- `b` is an integer from input.
- `a` and `b` are updated to integers from input.

The print statement is simply `print('No')`.

Since the print statement does not reference any of the variables `a`, `b`, or `t`, and only prints the string `'No'`, the output will be:

Output: **No**
