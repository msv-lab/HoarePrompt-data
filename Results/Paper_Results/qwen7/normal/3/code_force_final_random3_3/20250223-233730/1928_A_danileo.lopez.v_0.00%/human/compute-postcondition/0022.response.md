Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, indicating that all inputs have been processed. The values of `a` and `b` will be the last set of integers entered during the last iteration of the loop. If either `a` or `b` was even during any iteration, the corresponding `print('Yes')` statement would have been executed, but their values would still reflect the last input provided. If both `a` and `b` were odd in the last iteration, the `print('No')` statement would have been executed, but `t` would still be decremented to 0, signaling the end of the loop.

In summary, the loop will terminate when all `t` iterations are completed, leaving `t` as 0, and `a` and `b` with the values from the last input pair.
