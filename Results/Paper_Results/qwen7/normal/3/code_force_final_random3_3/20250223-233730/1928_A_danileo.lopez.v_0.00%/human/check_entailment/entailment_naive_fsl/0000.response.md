Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either dimension is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. However, this logic is incomplete. According to the problem description, a rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles, and those smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. 

Consider the test case where `a = 3` and `b = 3`. Both dimensions are odd, but the rectangle can still be split into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle. Therefore, the program incorrectly returns 'No' for this case.

To fix this, the program should check if the product of `a` and `b` is greater than 1 (which is always true for valid inputs) and then check if either `a` or `b` is even. If either dimension is even, another rectangle can be formed. If both dimensions are odd, the program should check if the sum of the dimensions is even, as this would allow the formation of a new rectangle by splitting and rearranging.
