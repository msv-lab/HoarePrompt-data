State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted as it is just used as a counter within the loop.
4. The initial value of `t` being an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) does not guarantee that the loop will execute; it could be 0 or negative, which would prevent the loop from running.
5. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that `t` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the state after adjustment is: **`t` must be greater than 0**.
