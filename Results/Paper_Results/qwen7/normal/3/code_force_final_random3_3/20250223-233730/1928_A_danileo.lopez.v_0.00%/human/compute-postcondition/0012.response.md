Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, and `a` and `b` are updated to integers from input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since the original values of `a` and `b` are replaced by the new inputs, the output state reflects that `a` and `b` are now the integers from the input, while `t` remains greater than 0.
