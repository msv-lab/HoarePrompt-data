Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is an index.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `q[j]` is a value greater than 0.
- If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` contains the value `j`.
- If there is no else part, the value of `q[j]` remains unchanged and `eta` does not change.

### Loop Head
```
for j in range(n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(n + 1)`, i.e., `0 <= j < n + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was an index, `n` was a positive integer, and `q[j]` was a value greater than 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not modify `j`).
- Therefore, `j` will be `j + 1` in the next iteration.
- Since `n` is a positive integer and does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `q[j]` may or may not be greater than 0 depending on the value of `j + 1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `q[j]` is a value greater than 0 if `j + 1` is within the valid range.**

To be more precise:
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `q[j]` is a value greater than 0 if `j + 1` is within the valid range `0 <= j + 1 < n + 1`.

So, the final state can be summarized as:
State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `q[j]` is a value greater than 0 if `j + 1` is within the valid range.**
