Output State: **`eta` is a list containing the integer `j`, `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution, `j` is 0, and `n` is a non-negative integer.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` (which is 0) to the list `eta`. The values of `q`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
