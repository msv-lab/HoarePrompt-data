State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. The loop condition is `range(n + 1)`, which means the loop will run from `j = 0` to `j = n`.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer (greater than or equal to 0), because if `n` is negative, `range(n + 1)` would generate no values.
4. The variable `j` starts at 0 when the loop begins.
5. The initial state of `eta` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` set to 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `eta` remains as an empty list.
