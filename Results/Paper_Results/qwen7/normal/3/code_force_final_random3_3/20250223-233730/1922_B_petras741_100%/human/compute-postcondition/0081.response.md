Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `n`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**: Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it runs, the next value of `j` will be `2`.

4. **Check the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that if `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` becomes `[1]`. However, since `eta` was initially an empty list (`[]`), and the condition `q[j] > 0` was met when `j` was 1 (making `eta` become `[1]`), this condition does not affect the value of `eta` for `j = 2` unless `q[2]` is also greater than 0. But since we are only adjusting the state at the start of the next iteration, we cannot assume anything about `q[2]` based on the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the States**: We only need to adjust the state of `j` because `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not given here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`eta` is an empty list (`[]`), `j` is 2, and if `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` becomes `[1]`**.
