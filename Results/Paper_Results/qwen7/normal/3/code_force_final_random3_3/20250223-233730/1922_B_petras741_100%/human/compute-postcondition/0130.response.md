Output State: **`eta` contains the value `j`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. The conditions for `j`, `n`, and the value of `q[j]` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `eta` now includes the value of `j`, while `n` and the condition on `q[j]` stay the same.
