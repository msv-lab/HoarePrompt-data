Output State: `j` is `n-1`; for every index `k` from 0 to `n-1`, `q[k]` is incremented by 1 as many times as the value of `w[k]` appears in the list `w`.

Explanation: The loop runs `n` times (from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`). In each iteration, the value at index `w[j]` in the list `q` is incremented by 1. After all iterations, `j` will be `n-1`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `q[k]` for each index `k` will be the count of how many times `k` appears in the list `w`.
