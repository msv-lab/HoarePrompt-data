Based on the initial state provided:

- `eta` is a list with a length of 1 (`eta_ln = 1`).
- `j` is equal to `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `q[j]` is a value greater than 0.
- `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`. Since the length of `eta` is 1, `eta[0]` is the only element in the list, which means `rho = q[0]`.

Given these conditions, we need to evaluate the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.

Since `n` is a positive integer and `j` equals `n`, let's denote `n` as some positive integer `k`. The expression simplifies to:

\[ k \times (k - 1) \times (k - 2) // 6 \]

This expression calculates the binomial coefficient for choosing 3 items out of `k` items, which is also known as "k choose 3" or \(\binom{k}{3}\).

Since the exact value of `n` (or `k`) is not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. However, the expression will always yield an integer result due to the integer division operator `//`.

Output: **k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) // 6 (where k is a positive integer)**
