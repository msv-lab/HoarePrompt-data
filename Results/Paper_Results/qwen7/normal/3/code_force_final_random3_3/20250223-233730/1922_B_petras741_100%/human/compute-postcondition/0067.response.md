Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration (assuming no other operations change `j`), `j` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `j` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

The state after adjusting for the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
