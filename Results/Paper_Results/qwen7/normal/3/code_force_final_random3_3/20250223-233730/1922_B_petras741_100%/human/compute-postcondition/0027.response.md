Postcondition: **`eta` is a list containing the integers `1`, `1`, and `3`. `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution. `j` is `3`. If `q[3]` is greater than `0`, then no changes are made to `eta` and `q`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `eta` and `q` as there is no else part.**
