Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0.
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` will be 1.
   - `q[w[j]]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, where `j` is now 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 1, `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**
