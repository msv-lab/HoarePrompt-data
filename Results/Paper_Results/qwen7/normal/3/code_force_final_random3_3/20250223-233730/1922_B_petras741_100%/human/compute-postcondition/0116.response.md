Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `w` by taking an input string, splitting it into individual elements based on spaces, converting each element to an integer, and storing these integers in the list `w`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
