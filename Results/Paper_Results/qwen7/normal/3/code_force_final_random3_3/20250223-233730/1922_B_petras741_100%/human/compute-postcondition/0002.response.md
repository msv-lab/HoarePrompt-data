State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = t-1`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer and within the range of 1 to \(10^4\).
3. The variable `i` starts at 0 before the loop begins.
4. The variable `buffer` is mentioned to be an empty list, and this state does not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` (to ensure it is a positive integer within the specified range) and `i` (which starts at 0). The state of `buffer` remains unchanged as it does not influence the loop's execution conditions.
