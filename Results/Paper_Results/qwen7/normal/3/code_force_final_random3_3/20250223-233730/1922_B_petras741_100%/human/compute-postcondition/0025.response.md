Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` which ranges from `0` to `n` inclusive. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `j`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `eta` is a list containing the integers `1` and `1`.
   - `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution.
   - `j` is `2`.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues if `q[j]` is greater than `0`. After the previous iteration, `j` is `2`. We need to check if `q[2]` is greater than `0`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `j` is `2`, we need to check the value of `q[2]` to determine if the loop can continue. If `q[2]` is greater than `0`, it will be decremented by `1`. If `q[2]` is `0` or less, it will remain unchanged.

5. **Update the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by `1` (from `2` to `3`). Therefore, `j` will be `3` at the start of the next iteration. The value of `q[2]` will either be `q[2] - 1` or `q[2]` depending on its initial value.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `eta` remains the same: a list containing the integers `1` and `1`.
- `q` remains the same as it was updated during the loop execution.
- `j` is incremented by `1` to `3`.
- `n` remains the same as it is a non-negative integer and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`eta` is a list containing the integers `1` and `1`; `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution; `j` is `3`; `n` is a non-negative integer.**

State: **`eta` is a list containing the integers `1` and `1`; `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution; `j` is `3`; `n` is a non-negative integer.**
