Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to `1`.
   - `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`.

3. **Initial values of the variables**:
   - `eta` is a list containing `[1, 1, 3]`, so `eta_ln` is `3`.
   - `q` is a list where each element `q[j]` has been decremented by `1` for each iteration where `q[j]` was greater than `0`. However, since `q` is not explicitly defined in the given state, we focus on the loop head variables.
   - `rho` is `q[1]`, but again, `q` is not defined, so we focus on `j` and `eta_ln`.
   - `j` is `n+1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `eta_ln` is `3`.

4. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `eta_ln`. Given `eta_ln` is `3`, the loop will execute if `j` is `1` or `2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` must be `1` to start the loop.
   - `eta_ln` is fixed at `3`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `eta_ln`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 1, `eta_ln` is 3**
