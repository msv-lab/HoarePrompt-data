Postcondition: **`j` is equal to `n + eta_ln`, `eta_ln` remains the same, and `res` is the sum of its initial value plus the contributions from each iteration of the loop, specifically: if `eta_ln` is 1, then `res` is updated to `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6` and `rho` is updated to `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, for each `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`, `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and then by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]` after each iteration.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables `j`, `eta_ln`, and `res` after the execution of the if-else block. It covers both scenarios: when `eta_ln` is 1 and when `eta_ln` is greater than 1.
