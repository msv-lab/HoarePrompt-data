Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable in this case is `j`, and the condition for the loop to continue is `j < eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 3
   - `eta_ln` must be at least 2
   - `res` is `res` plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2 * rho`
   - `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`

3. **Calculate the new value of `j`**: Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 4.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue if `j < eta_ln`. Given that `j` is now 4, the condition `4 < eta_ln` must hold true. Therefore, `eta_ln` must be greater than 4.

5. **Update the value of `rho`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `rho` was increased by `q[eta[j]]`. Since `j` is now 4, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[4]]`.

6. **Update the expression for `res`**: The expression for `res` involves `q[eta[1]]`, `q[eta[3]]`, and `q[eta[4]]`. However, since `j` is now 4, the term involving `q[eta[4]]` will be added to `res` in the next iteration.

Given these steps, the updated states for the next iteration are:

- `j` is 4
- `eta_ln` must be greater than 4
- `res` will include the additional term `q[eta[4]] * (q[eta[4]] - 1) // 2 * rho`
- `rho` is increased by `q[eta[4]]`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is 4, `eta_ln` must be greater than 4, `res` is `res` plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2 * rho` plus `q[eta[4]] * (q[eta[4]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[4]]`**
