Output State: **`j` is 3, `eta_ln` must be at least 2, `res` is `res` plus `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`**.

Explanation: The value of `j` is 3, so `rho` is increased by `q[eta[3]]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
