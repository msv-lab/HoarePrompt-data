Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `q` is a list of n+1 elements, all initialized to 0 except for the element at index `w[1]` which is now 1, `j` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, the code effectively does `q[w[1]] += 1`. Since `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, and `j` is 1, the value at `w[1]` is used to increment the corresponding element in `q`. Initially, all elements in `q` are set to 0, so after executing the code, the element at index `w[1]` in `q` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
