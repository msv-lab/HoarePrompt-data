Output State: **`j` is 0; `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 0 and `n` must be greater than 0 (though `n` itself is not directly involved in this operation), the only variable that changes is `q[w[j]]`, which is incremented by 1 since `j` is 0.
