Postcondition: `eta` is a list containing the integers `1`, `1`, and `3`; `q` is a list where each element `q[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n`) has been decremented by `1` for each iteration where `q[j]` was greater than `0`; `rho` is `q[1]`, `j` is `n+1`, `n` remains unchanged, and `eta_ln` is equal to `1`.
