Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, a, and m for each test case, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}. It returns a result based on the values of t, a, and m.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `t`, `a`, and `m`. The function processes these integers according to their specified ranges and returns a result for each test case.
