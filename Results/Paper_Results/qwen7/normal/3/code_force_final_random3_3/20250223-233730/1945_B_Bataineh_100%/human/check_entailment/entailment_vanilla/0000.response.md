### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution checks different conditions based on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `m`.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** `m < a` and `m < b`
     - If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the solution prints `2`. This is because the first and second installations will have their first fireworks visible at different times, and subsequent launches will not overlap within the visibility period `m + 1`.
   - **Case 2:** `m < a` and `m > b`
     - If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, the solution prints `2 + m // b`. This accounts for the initial two fireworks plus additional fireworks from the second installation.
   - **Case 3:** `m < b` and `m > a`
     - If `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`, the solution prints `2 + m // a`. This accounts for the initial two fireworks plus additional fireworks from the first installation.
   - **Case 4:** Otherwise
     - If neither of the above conditions holds, the solution prints `m // a + m // b + 2`. This accounts for the initial two fireworks plus the maximum number of additional fireworks from both installations.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic seems to handle the cases where the visibility period `m` is shorter or longer compared to the launch intervals `a` and `b`.
   - However, the solution does not consider the possibility of fireworks overlapping exactly at the end of their visibility period, which might lead to an overestimation.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider the edge case where `a` and `b` are relatively prime and `m` is large enough to allow multiple overlaps. The current logic might not correctly account for these overlaps.

### Conclusion:
The given solution appears to handle most cases correctly but may not fully account for all edge cases, particularly those involving exact overlaps at the end of the visibility period.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
