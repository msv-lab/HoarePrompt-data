Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state of `i` and `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `t` is still an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values from the input split.
