Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.

The print statement is `print(2 + m // b)`.

Here, `m // b` represents integer division of `m` by `b`. Since the exact values of `m` and `b` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact result of `m // b`. However, we know it will be an integer.

Therefore, the expression `2 + m // b` will be evaluated as an integer plus another integer, resulting in an integer.

Output: **2 + m // b (where m and b are integers obtained from the input split by spaces)**
