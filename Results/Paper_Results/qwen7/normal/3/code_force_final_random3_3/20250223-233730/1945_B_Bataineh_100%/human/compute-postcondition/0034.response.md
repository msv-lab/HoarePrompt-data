The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.

Given that `i` is currently 1 and `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` can indeed be incremented to 2 if `t` is greater than 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2, and `t` remains the same.

State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**
