Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = k - 2
        for i in range(x - k + 3):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is an integer equal to the first number in the string `s`, `x` is an integer equal to the second number in the string `s`, and `a` is an integer equal to the third number in the string `s`. `s` is the second line of the input (a string). 

- If `x < k - 1` and `a < x + 1`, then `a` is less than or equal to `x`.
- If `x < k - 1` and `a >= x + 1`, then `a` remains unchanged.
- If `x == k - 1` and `a >= x + 2`, then `a` remains unchanged.
- If `x == k - 1` and `a < x + 2`, then `a` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
- If `k - 3 <= x < k - 1`, then `a` is equal to the initial value `k - 2` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added `x - k + 3` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then `k` is decreased by 2, `x` is greater than `k - 3`, `a` remains unchanged, and `z` becomes the initial value of `z` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration of `x - k + 3` times. If `x` is equal to or greater than `k - 1`, then no changes are made to `k`, `x`, and `a`, and `z` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is `k - 2`, `x` is `x + 1`, `a` remains unchanged, and `z` is updated as follows:
- If `x < k - 1`, then `z` is updated based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` times.
- If `x == k - 1`, then `z` is updated based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` times.
- If `x > k - 5`, then `z` is increased by `3 * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
