Functionality: **The function processes input values \(k\), \(x\), and \(a\) from standard input. For each set of values, it checks specific conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on those conditions. After processing all inputs, the variables \(k\) and \(x\) are modified such that \(k\) is reduced by 4 and \(x\) is increased by 3, while \(a\) remains unchanged. The function does not return any value but modifies the internal state of \(k\) and \(x\) and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each input set.**
