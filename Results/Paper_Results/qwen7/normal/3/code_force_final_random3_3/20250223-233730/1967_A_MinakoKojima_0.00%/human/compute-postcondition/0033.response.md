Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is the initial value of `ans` (which is `a[0]`) multiplied by the product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, unless `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, in which case `ans` remains `math.factorial(n)`**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `t`, `a`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for updating `ans` and the value of `m` will be determined later when the next part of the code is executed.
