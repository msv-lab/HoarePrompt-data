Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`**.

The code calculates the factorial of `n` and assigns it to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
