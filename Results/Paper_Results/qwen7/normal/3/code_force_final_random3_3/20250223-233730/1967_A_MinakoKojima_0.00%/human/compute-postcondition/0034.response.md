Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is the initial value of `ans` (which is `a[0]`) multiplied by the product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. The variable `a` is updated to a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `ans`) remain unchanged in terms of their values or conditions.
