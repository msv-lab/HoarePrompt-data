Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is either the factorial of `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, or the cumulative product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` starting from index 1 up to `n-1` if `k` is less than `n * m`. Additionally, `i` equals `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
