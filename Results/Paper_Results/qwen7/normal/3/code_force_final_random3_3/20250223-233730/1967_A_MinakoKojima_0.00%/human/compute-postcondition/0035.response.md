Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is the initial value of `ans` (which is `a[0]`) multiplied by the product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, `m` is now the minimum value in list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `m = min(a)` assigns the minimum value in the list `a` to the variable `m`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `m` is updated to reflect the minimum value in the list `a`, while `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `ans` retain their original values relative to the initial state.
