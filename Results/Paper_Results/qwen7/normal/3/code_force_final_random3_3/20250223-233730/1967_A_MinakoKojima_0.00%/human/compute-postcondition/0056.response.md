Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is equal to `ans * (a[3] - a[2])`
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 0

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the start of the current iteration because the loop condition is based on `i < n` and `i` is being incremented, not `n`.
   - The expression `ans = ans * (a[3] - a[2])` suggests that `ans` is updated in each iteration, but since we are only asked to adjust the loop head variables, we don't need to change `ans`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 4.
   - `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is equal to `ans * (a[3] - a[2])`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0**
