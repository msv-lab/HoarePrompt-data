Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the next positive integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is either `math.factorial(n)` if `k >= n * m`, or the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, and `i` is equal to `n`.**
