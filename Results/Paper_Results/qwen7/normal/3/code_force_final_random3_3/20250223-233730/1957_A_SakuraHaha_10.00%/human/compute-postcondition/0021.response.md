Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers provided by the user, counting the occurrences of each unique integer. It then calculates the sum of one-fourth of the count for each unique integer and prints the result. The function does not return any value but modifies the internal state by processing the input list and using a dictionary to store counts.**
