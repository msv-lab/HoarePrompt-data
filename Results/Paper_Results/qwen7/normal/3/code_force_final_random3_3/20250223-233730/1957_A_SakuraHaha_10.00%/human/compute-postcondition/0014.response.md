Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in cnt.values()`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are values in `cnt.values()`. This means the loop will execute for each key-value pair in the dictionary `cnt`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is 0 + x // 4 (where `x` is the value from the previous iteration)
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
   - `a` is an empty list
   - `cnt` must have at least one value (meaning it has at least one key-value pair)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is taken from `cnt.values()`, after the first iteration, `cnt` will have one less key-value pair.
   - Therefore, `cnt` must now have at least one less value.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `cnt` has at least one less value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 0 + x // 4 (where `x` is the value from the previous iteration), `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` must have at least one less value**.
