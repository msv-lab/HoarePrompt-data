Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the sum of `x // 4` for all values `x` in `cnt`.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `cnt` is a dictionary with the counts of each unique element from the original list `a`.

Since `a` is an empty list, `cnt` will also be an empty dictionary because there are no elements in `a` to count. Therefore, `ans` will be the sum of `x // 4` for all values `x` in an empty dictionary, which means `ans` will be 0.

Output: **0**
