You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the following list contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary with multiple key-value pairs where each key is an element from the original list `a` and each value is the count of occurrences of that element in the original list `a`.
    #
    #This final state occurs because the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, updating the `cnt` dictionary to keep track of how many times each element appears. After all elements have been processed, the list `a` becomes empty, and `cnt` contains the counts of each unique element from the original list.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of `x // 4` for all values `x` in `cnt`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary with the counts of each unique element from the original list `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 0



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks.
2. A regular polygon needs at least 3 sides, and all sides must be equal.
3. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
4. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths.
5. It then counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary `cnt`.
6. The program calculates the number of polygons by dividing the count of each stick length by 4 (since each polygon needs at least 3 sides, and we want to maximize the number of polygons).
7. However, there's an issue with this approach:
   - The program assumes that each polygon can use up to 4 sides of the same length, but it doesn't ensure that the polygons are regular (i.e., all sides are used equally across polygons).
   - For example, if we have 6 sticks of length 2 and 12 sticks of length 3, the program would incorrectly calculate the number of polygons as 1 (6//4) instead of 2 (one triangle and one square).

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem because it does not account for the requirement that the polygons must be regular and that no stick can be reused.
