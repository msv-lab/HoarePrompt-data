Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the function `func_1` where the logic to determine the maximum number of regular polygons is flawed. Specifically, the program only checks if the count of each stick length is divisible by 4 (i.e., it assumes that only squares can be formed). However, the problem requires forming any type of regular polygon (triangle, square, pentagon, etc.), and the number 4 should be replaced by 3 (minimum sides of a polygon).

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version will properly calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by checking divisibility by 3 instead of 4.
