Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers; `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`. Since `m` is already defined, `B` is computed based on the value of `m` and `b`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `A` remain unchanged from their initial state.
