Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\).
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.
   - `A` is recalculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(A + B)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `A` and `B` are both calculated as `int(m / a) + 1` because they are recalculated with the same formula.

Therefore, both `A` and `B` have the same value, which is `int(m / a) + 1`.

So, the expression `A + B` becomes:
\[ \text{A} + \text{B} = (\text{int}(m / a) + 1) + (\text{int}(m / a) + 1) = 2 \times (\text{int}(m / a) + 1) \]

Given this, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **2 * (int(m / a) + 1)**
