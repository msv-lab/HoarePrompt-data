Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the code calculates how many fireworks from each installation would be visible within \(m\) minutes but does not consider the simultaneous launches from both installations over an extended period.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\), which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks at the same time. We then need to calculate how many fireworks are visible in the sky at any given moment considering the LCM and the visibility duration \(m+1\).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks visible at the start
        start_visible_a = (m + 1) // a
        start_visible_b = (m + 1) // b
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks visible due to simultaneous launches
        simultaneous_launches = (lcm_ab + m) // lcm_ab
        
        # The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time
        max_visible = start_visible_a + start_visible_b - simultaneous_launches + 1
        
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected program should provide the right answer by considering the simultaneous launches and the visibility duration properly.
