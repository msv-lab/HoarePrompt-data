Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in any operation.
