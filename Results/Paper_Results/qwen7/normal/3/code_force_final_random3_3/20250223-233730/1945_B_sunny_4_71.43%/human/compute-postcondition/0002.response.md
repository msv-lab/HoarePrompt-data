Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers inputted separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
