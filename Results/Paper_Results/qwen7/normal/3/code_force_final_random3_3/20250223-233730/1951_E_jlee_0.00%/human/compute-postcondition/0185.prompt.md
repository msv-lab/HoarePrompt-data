Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is the length of the list `s` and equals 1, `done` is `False`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is 1, `done` is `True`, `count` is either unchanged or less than 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` remains unchanged. If the condition `count2 < count` is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count`, `done` is `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `done` is `True`, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is 1, `count` is 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1. If `count2 > 0` and `count2 < count`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2 > count`, `count` is set to `count2`. If `count > 1` and `s[j] == s[n - 1 - j]`, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If none of these conditions are met, `count2` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `done` is `True`, `i` is `0`, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is `1`, `count` is `0`, `count2` is either `0` or `1`, `j` is `0`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than `1`, `count` is incremented by `1`. Otherwise, `count2` is incremented by `1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
