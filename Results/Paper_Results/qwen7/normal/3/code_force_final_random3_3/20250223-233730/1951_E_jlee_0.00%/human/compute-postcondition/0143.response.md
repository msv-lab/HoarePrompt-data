Postcondition: `done` is `True`, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is 1, `count` is 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1. If `count2 > 0` and `count2 < count`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2 > count`, `count` is set to `count2`. If `count > 1` and `s[j] == s[n - 1 - j]`, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If none of these conditions are met, `count2` is increased by 1.
