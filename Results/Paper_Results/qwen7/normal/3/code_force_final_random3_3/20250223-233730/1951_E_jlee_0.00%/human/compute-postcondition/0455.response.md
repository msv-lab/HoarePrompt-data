Postcondition: `done` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, `count` is either 0 or greater than 1, `count2` is either 1 or equal to `count`, `s` is a list representation of the string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first element of the list `s`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `done` becomes `True` if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`; otherwise, `count2` is equal to `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is 1.
