Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string.
- `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `done` is set to `True`.
- `count` is equal to `j + 1`.
- If `count` is greater than 0, then `count` remains greater than 0, `s[j]` remains not equal to `x`, and `done` is set to `True`.
- If `count` is not greater than 0, then `count2` remains greater than 0.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
