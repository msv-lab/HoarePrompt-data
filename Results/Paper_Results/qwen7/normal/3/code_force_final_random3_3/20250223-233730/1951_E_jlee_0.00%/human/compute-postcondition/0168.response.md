Postcondition: **`done` is `True`, `i` is `0`, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is `1`, `count` is `0`, `count2` is `0`, `j` is `0`. If `count` is greater than `1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count2` remains `0`.**
