Output State: **`done` is `True`, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is 1, `count` is 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j].** 

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
