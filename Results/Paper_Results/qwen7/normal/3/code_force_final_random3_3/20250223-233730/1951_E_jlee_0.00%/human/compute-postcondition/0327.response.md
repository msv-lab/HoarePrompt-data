Output State: **`s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `done` is set to `True`, `count` is either equal to `j + 1` or greater than 0, `s[j + 1]` remains not equal to `x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, it only indicates that we exit the loop or if statement. All the conditions and values of the variables before the `break` statement remain unchanged.
