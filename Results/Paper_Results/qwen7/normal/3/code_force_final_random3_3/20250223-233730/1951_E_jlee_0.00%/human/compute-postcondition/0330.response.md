Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `done` is set to `True`, `count` is equal to `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, and `s[j + 1]` remains not equal to `x`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, the conditions remain as they were before the if statement.
