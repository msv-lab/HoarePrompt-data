Output: **NO**

Explanation: 
- The variable `done` is set to `True`.
- The variable `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The variable `count` is equal to `j`.
- The condition `not done` is true, but this condition is not relevant to the `print` statement since the `print` statement is executed regardless of the value of `done`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will simply output the string `'NO'`.
