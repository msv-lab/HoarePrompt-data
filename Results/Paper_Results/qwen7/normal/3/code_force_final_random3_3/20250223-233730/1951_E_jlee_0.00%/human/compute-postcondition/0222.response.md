Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string.
- The current value of `j` is such that the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of `s`, `j`, and the specific characters at indices `j` and `n - 1 - j` are not needed to determine the output of this print statement.

Output: **YES**
