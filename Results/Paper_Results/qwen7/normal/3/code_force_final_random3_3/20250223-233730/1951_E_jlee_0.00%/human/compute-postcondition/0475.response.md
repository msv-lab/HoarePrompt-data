Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` remains `False`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `j` is either 0 or 1.
- `count` is either 0 or equal to `j`.
- `count2` is either 1 or equal to `count`.
- `s` is a list representation of the string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 1.
- `x` is the first element of the list `s`.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Value of `j`:**
   - `j` can only be 0 or 1.
   
2. **Value of `string`:**
   - `s` is a list representation of the string.
   - Let's assume the string is `"abc"`, so `s = ['a', 'b', 'c']`.

3. **Case 1: `j = 0`**
   - `string[:j - 1]` would be `string[:0 - 1]` which is an empty slice: `""`.
   - `string[j - 1:]` would be `string[0 - 1:]` which is also an empty slice: `""`.
   - Therefore, the output would be `("", "")`.

4. **Case 2: `j = 1`**
   - `string[:j - 1]` would be `string[:1 - 1]` which is an empty slice: `""`.
   - `string[j - 1:]` would be `string[1 - 1:]` which is `string[0:]` and equals `["a", "b", "c"]`.
   - Therefore, the output would be `("", ["a", "b", "c"])`.

### Conclusion:
Since `j` can only be 0 or 1, the output will be one of the two cases described above.

Output: **("", "") or ("", ["a", "b", "c"])**
