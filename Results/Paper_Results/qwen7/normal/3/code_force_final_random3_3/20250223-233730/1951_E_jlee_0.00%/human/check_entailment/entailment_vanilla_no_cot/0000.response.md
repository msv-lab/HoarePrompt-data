Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The code correctly handles single-character strings by printing "NO". However, it should still attempt to check if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, which it doesn't do.

2. **Checking for Non-Palindromic Substrings**: The logic for checking if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings is flawed. Specifically, the code only checks certain conditions without considering all possible partitions.

3. **Partitioning Logic**: The code attempts to partition the string in various ways but does not cover all possible scenarios. For example, it does not handle cases where the string can be split into more than two non-palindromic substrings.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as strings with repeated characters or strings that are not easily partitionable into non-palindromic substrings.

### Correct Solution Outline:

A correct solution would involve:
- Checking if the string itself is a palindrome.
- If the string is a palindrome, then it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- If the string is not a palindrome, it can always be partitioned into at least two non-palindromic substrings (e.g., `s[0]` and `s[1:]`).

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input().strip()
        n = len(string)
        
        # Check if the string is a palindrome
        if string == string[::-1]:
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            print(1)
            print(string)
```

This solution correctly identifies whether the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints the appropriate output.
