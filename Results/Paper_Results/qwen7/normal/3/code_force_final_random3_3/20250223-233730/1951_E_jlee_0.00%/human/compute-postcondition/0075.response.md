Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `string` is an input string from the user
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string, with the first character assigned to `x`
- `n` is 1
- `done` is `True`
- `count` is greater than 1
- `count2` is 0
- `j` is 0
- The current value of `count2` is equal to the current value of `count`

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables, as it is a direct string literal being printed.

Output: **YES**
