Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `done` is `True`
   - `i` is `0`
   - `string` is an input string from the user (we don't know the exact value yet)
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string, with the first character assigned to `x`
   - `n` is `1`
   - `count` is `0`
   - `count2` is either `0` or `1`
   - `j` is `0`

2. **Condition in the Loop:**
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than `1`, then `count` is incremented by `1`.
   - Otherwise, the loop or statement is exited and `done` remains `True`.

Given that `done` is `True` and `j` is `0`, let's analyze the condition:
- `s[j]` is the first character of the list `s`, which is `x`.
- Since `s[j]` is equal to `x`, the condition `s[j] != x` is false.
- Therefore, the `count` is not incremented, and the loop or statement is exited.

3. **Values after the Condition:**
   - `done` is still `True`
   - `i` is `0`
   - `string` is the original input string
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string, with the first character assigned to `x`
   - `n` is `1`
   - `count` is `0`
   - `count2` is either `0` or `1`
   - `j` is `0`

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(string[:j], string[j:])`
   - Since `j` is `0`, `string[:j]` is an empty string (`""`).
   - `string[j:]` is the entire string `string`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'', [string]**
