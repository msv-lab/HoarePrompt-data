Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except for `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. All other elements in the `ans` list remain at their initial value of \(10^9\). The variable `i` remains unchanged.
