Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where `ans[0]` is `ans[1] - arr[0]`, `ans[1]` is `ans[2] - arr[1]`, and so on until `ans[n-2]` is `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`, with all other elements in `ans` still being \(10^9\), `i` is now -1.
    #
    #This means after the loop completes all its iterations, the `ans` list will have its first `n-1` elements updated based on the given formula, and the last element (`ans[n-1]`) remains unchanged as it has no corresponding `arr` value to subtract from it. The variable `i` will be set to -1 since the loop condition `i >= 0` will no longer be satisfied.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first `n-1` elements are calculated based on the formula `ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-2`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` remains unchanged as it is not involved in any subtraction. Additionally, all elements except the first `n-1` are set to \(10^9\), and the variable `i` is set to `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first `n-1` elements are calculated using the formula `ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-2`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` remains unchanged. All elements except the first `n-1` are set to \(10^9\), and the variable `i` is set to `-1`.
