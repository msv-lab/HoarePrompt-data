Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input.**

Explanation: The line `k = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `k`. This overrides the previous value of `k` which was dependent on the expressions involving `a`, `b`, and `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
