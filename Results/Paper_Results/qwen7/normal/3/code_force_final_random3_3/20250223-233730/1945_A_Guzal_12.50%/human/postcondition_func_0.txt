The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it calculates a value `k` based on specific conditions involving these integers. If the conditions are met, it prints the value of `k`; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints the results for each test case.
