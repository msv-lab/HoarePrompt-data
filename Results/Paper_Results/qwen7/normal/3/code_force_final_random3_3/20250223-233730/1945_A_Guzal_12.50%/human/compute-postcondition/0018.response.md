Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is either 0 or \(a + (b + c) // 3 + 1\), and \((b + c) \% 3\) is not 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged, but now `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers obtained from the input. The condition that \((b + c) \% 3\) is not 0 remains valid.
