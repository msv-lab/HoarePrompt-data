Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is either `a + (b + c) // 3` or `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1 depending on whether `(b + c) % 3` is not equal to 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and splits them into `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are determined by the input.
