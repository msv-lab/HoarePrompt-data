Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
3. The logic inside the loop checks if it's possible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences:
   - If there are extroverts (`b`) but not enough universals (`c < 3`) and the total number of extroverts and universals cannot be perfectly divided by 3, then it prints `-1` because it's impossible to find a solution.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of tents required:
     - `a` introverts need `a` tents since each introvert needs a separate tent.
     - The remaining participants (extroverts and universals) can be accommodated in groups of 3. The number of full groups is `(b + c) // 3`.
     - If there are any remaining participants after forming full groups (checked by `(b + c) % 3 != 0`), an additional tent is needed.
4. The program correctly handles all given examples and edge cases, such as when there are no participants at all (`0 0 0`), or when there are only introverts or extroverts.

Given the above analysis, the program logic matches the problem description and correctly computes the minimum number of tents required or returns `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate all participants.

Correctness: **True**
