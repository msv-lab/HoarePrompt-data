Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- `k` is 0.
- \((b + c) \% 3\) is not 0.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `-1` without any dependency on the other variables or their values.

Output: **-1**
