Given the initial state and the conditions:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- `k` is calculated as \( k = a + \left(\frac{b + c}{3}\right) + 1 \).
- \((b + c) \% 3\) is not 0.

We need to determine the value of `k` and then print it.

Let's break down the calculation of `k`:

1. `k = a + \left(\frac{b + c}{3}\right) + 1`
2. Since \((b + c) \% 3 \neq 0\), it means \(b + c\) is not divisible by 3, so \(\frac{b + c}{3}\) will result in an integer part plus a remainder. For example, if \(b + c = 4\), then \(\frac{4}{3} = 1\) with a remainder of 1.

Thus, \(\left(\frac{b + c}{3}\right)\) will be the integer part of \(\frac{b + c}{3}\).

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[ k = a + \text{integer part of } \frac{b + c}{3} + 1 \]

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, we can only express `k` in terms of these variables.

Output: **a + integer part of (b + c) / 3 + 1**
