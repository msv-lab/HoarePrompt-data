Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is present) or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` if both `x` and `n - y` are valid indices, otherwise `z` is an empty string, `n` is updated to an input integer.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer input by the user, while all other variables retain their previous states.
