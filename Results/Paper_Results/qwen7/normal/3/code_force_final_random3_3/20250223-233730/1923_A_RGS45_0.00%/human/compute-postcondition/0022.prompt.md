Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and it is equal to the input integer from the user; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input(''))
    arr = str(input(''))
    x = arr.find('1')
    y = arr[::-1].find('1')
    z = arr[x:n - y]
    print(z.count('0'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is present) or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` if both `x` and `n - y` are valid indices, otherwise `z` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is present) or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` if both `x` and `n - y` are valid indices, otherwise `z` is an empty string, `n` is updated to an input integer, `arr` is updated to a string input by the user, `y` is assigned the value of `arr[::-1].find('1')`, `z` is reassigned to the slice of `arr` from `x` to `n - y - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is the new string input by the user, `t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is a substring from `arr[x]` to `arr[n - y - 1]` if both `x` and `n - y` are valid indices, otherwise `z` is an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
