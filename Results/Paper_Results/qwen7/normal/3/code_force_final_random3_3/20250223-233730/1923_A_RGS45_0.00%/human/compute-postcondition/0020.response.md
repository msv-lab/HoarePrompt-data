Output State: **`arr` is the new string input by the user, `t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is a substring from `arr[x]` to `arr[n - y - 1]` if both `x` and `n - y` are valid indices, otherwise `z` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code assigns a substring of `arr` to `z`. This substring starts at index `x` (the first occurrence of '1') and ends at index `n - y - 1` (one position before `n - y`). If `x` or `n - y` is invalid (e.g., `x` is -1 or `n - y` is less than `x`), then `z` remains an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
