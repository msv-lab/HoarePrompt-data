State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `_` is used in the `for` loop header as a placeholder for iterating over a range of `t` values.
2. The loop will start with `_` being 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `t-1`.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid integer within the range [1, 1000].
4. The initial value of `_` is set to 0 when the loop starts.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is within the specified range, and the loop counter `_` is set to 0.
