Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Operations**: The program calculates the number of zeros between the first and last '1' in the string `arr`, which does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The problem requires moving chips to the closest free cell to the left, which may involve moving multiple chips to achieve the goal.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic for determining the minimum number of operations is flawed. Moving a chip to the closest free cell to the left might require multiple steps, and simply counting zeros between the first and last '1' does not account for these steps.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases where the chips need to be moved across multiple free cells to form a single block. For example, in the input "0 1 0 1 0 1", the program would incorrectly output 1, but the correct answer is 2.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
