Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers inputted from the user.
- `k` is 0.
- `b` is either not divisible by 3 with `b % 3 + c` less than 3 or divisible by 3.

The print statement is simply `print(-1)`. This statement will print the integer `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **-1**
