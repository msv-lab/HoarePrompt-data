Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case contains three non-negative integers a, b, and c representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, it returns a specific value based on the given conditions.**

Note: The function does not accept parameters in the traditional sense (i.e., through function arguments), but it processes input data (a list of test cases) and returns a result for each test case.
