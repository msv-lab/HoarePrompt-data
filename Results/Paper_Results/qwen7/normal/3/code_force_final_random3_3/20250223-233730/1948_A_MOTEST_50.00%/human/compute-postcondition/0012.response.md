Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2.**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding twice the value of `s[x]` to it. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
