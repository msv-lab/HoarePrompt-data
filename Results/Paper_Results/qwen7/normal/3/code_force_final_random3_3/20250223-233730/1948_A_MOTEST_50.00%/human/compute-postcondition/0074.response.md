Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer. If `n` equals 1, the conditions remain the same. Otherwise, `t` must be at least 1, `i` is at least 0, `n` must be at least 3 and an odd number, `ans` is 'A' repeated `2 * (n // 2 - 1)` times, `x` is `n // 2 + 1`, and `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1`.
