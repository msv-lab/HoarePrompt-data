Output State: **`ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. The other variables (`ans`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `x` by 1, while the other variables retain their respective conditions and values.
