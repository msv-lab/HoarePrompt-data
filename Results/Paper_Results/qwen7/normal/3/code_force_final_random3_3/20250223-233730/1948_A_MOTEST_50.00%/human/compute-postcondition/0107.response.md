Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 'A' repeated `2 * (n // 2 - 1)` times, `x` is `n // 2 + 1`, `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1. If `n` equals 1, the function does nothing. Otherwise, if `t` is less than `n // 2`, `i` becomes `t + n // 2`, `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 11, `ans` is increased by `2 * s[x]` for each of the `n // 2 - 1` iterations, `x` is increased by 1 after each iteration, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.**
