Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and constraints, as specified in the problem statement.
2. For the case where `n` is 1, the program correctly outputs "NO", which is the expected behavior.
3. For even values of `n`, the program constructs a string where every character is special (each character is different from its neighbors). This is achieved by alternating between different uppercase Latin letters, starting from 'A'.
4. For odd values of `n`, the program starts with 'AAA' and then continues to alternate between different uppercase Latin letters, ensuring that each character is special except for the initial three 'A's.
5. The program ensures that the output string is at most 200 characters long, as required by the problem statement.
6. The logic for constructing the string is sound and covers all possible cases within the given constraints.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
