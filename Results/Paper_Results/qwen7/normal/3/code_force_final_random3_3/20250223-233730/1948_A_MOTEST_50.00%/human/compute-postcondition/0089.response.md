Output State: `t` must be less than `n // 2`, `i` is `t + n // 2`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is `s[1] * (2 * (n // 2))`, `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it must be less than `n // 2`. The variable `i` becomes `t + n // 2` because `i` starts from `t` and increments by 1 each time through the loop, so after `n // 2` iterations, `i` will be `t + n // 2`. The variable `n` remains the same as an input integer. The variable `ans` accumulates the string `s[x] * 2` for each iteration, so after `n // 2` iterations, `ans` will be `s[1] * (2 * (n // 2))`. The variable `x` increments by 1 each time through the loop, so after `n // 2` iterations, `x` will be `n // 2`. The variable `j` reaches `n // 2` after the last iteration of the loop.
