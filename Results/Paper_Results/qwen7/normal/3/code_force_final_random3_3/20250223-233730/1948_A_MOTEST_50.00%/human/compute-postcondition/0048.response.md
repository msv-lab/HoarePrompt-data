Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1, `n` must be at least 2.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, and `n` must be at least 2. After executing `x += 1`, `x` is increased by 1, while `ans` remains as increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]` before the increment, and the condition that `n` must be at least 2 is still valid.
