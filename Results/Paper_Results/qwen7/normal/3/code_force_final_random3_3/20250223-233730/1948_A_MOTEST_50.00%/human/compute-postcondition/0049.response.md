Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n // 2):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`.
   - `x` is increased by 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `n // 2` iterations. For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n // 2`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, if the loop is to continue, `j` must be less than `n // 2`. If it is exactly `n // 2`, the loop will terminate.
   - Therefore, `j` should be `j + 1` (the current value of `j` plus 1).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `ans` is not directly affected by the loop head, so its state remains the same.
   - `x` is not part of the loop head, so its state remains the same.
   - `j` is the variable in the loop head, so it needs to be adjusted to `j + 1`.
   - `n` must still be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be at least 2**.
