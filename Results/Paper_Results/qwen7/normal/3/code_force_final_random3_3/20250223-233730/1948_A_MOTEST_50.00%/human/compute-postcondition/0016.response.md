Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is now `x_prev + 2`, `j` is `j_prev + 1` and must be less than `n // 2`**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Given the initial state where `x` was `x_prev + 1`, after the increment, `x` becomes `x_prev + 2`. All other conditions and constraints remain the same.
