Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is `x_prev + 1`, `j` is `j_prev + 1` and must be less than `n // 2`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `2 * s[x]` to its current value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `j`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The conditions on `t`, `n`, `x`, and `j` still hold true.
