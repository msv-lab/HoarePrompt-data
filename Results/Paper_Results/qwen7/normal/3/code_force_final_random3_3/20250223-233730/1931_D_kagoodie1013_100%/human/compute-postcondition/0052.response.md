Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `num` and `arr`.
   - `num` is the variable that will take on each value from the list `arr` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `arr` is the list over which the loop iterates.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `count` is currently 0.
   - `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, which means it currently contains `[0]`.
   - `count` reflects the cumulative sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in `arr`.
   - `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.
   - `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array.
   - `x` is the first element of the next test case tuple.
   - `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple.
   - `arr` is the next test case array.

3. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each element in `arr`, the initial state of `arr` should reflect that it contains at least one element (since the loop will start and continue as long as there are elements left in `arr`).
   - The variable `num` will take on the values from `arr` one by one, starting from the first element.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `arr` must contain at least one element.
- `num` will be set to the first element of `arr`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`count` is 0, `results` is `[0]`, `count` reflects the cumulative sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in `arr`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the first element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, and `arr` is the next test case array that must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`**.
