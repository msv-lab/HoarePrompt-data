### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - It then splits the input into tokens and parses the test cases.
   - This part of the code is correct and handles the input as expected.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` and a dictionary `residue_map`.
   - It iterates through each element in the array `arr`.
   - For each element `num`, it calculates the remainders `r_x` and `r_y` as follows:
     - `r_x = -num % x` which is equivalent to `(x - (num % x)) % x`.
     - `r_y = num % y`.
   - It uses these remainders to check if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the `residue_map` and increments the count accordingly.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current element's remainders.

3. **Logic for Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The condition for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful is:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
   - Using the remainders, we can express these conditions as:
     - \((a_i \% x) + (a_j \% x) \equiv 0 \mod x\).
     - \((a_i \% y) - (a_j \% y) \equiv 0 \mod y\).

4. **Residue Map Usage:**
   - The `residue_map` keeps track of the frequency of each unique pair of remainders `(r_x, r_y)`.
   - When a new pair `(r_x, r_y)` is encountered, the count of beautiful pairs is incremented by the number of times this pair has been seen before.

5. **Final Results:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, the count of beautiful pairs is appended to the `results` list.
   - This process is repeated for each test case, and the results are returned.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs based on the given conditions. The use of the residue map ensures efficient counting of pairs that satisfy the conditions.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
