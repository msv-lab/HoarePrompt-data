Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map[(num % x, num % y)]` is incremented by 1, `test_cases` is a list that must have at least two tuples, `arr` must have at least one element, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `residue_map[current_key]` by 1. Since `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, this means that `residue_map[(num % x, num % y)]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
