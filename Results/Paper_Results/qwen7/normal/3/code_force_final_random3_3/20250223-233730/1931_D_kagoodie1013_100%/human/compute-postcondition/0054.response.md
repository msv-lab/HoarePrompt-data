Output State: **`count` is 0, `results` is `[0]`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is the next test case array, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_y = num % y`**

Explanation: The code calculates the residue of `num` modulo `y` and assigns it to `r_y`. No other variables are affected. The initial values of `count`, `results`, `residue_map`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `r_x` remain unchanged.
