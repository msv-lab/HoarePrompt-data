Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. This means the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the ones that need to be adjusted.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are more test cases in `test_cases`. Since we are starting a new iteration, we assume that there is at least one more test case available.

3. **Determine the New Values for Each Variable**:
   - `n`: This is the number of elements in the current test case array `arr`.
   - `x`: This is the first element of the current test case tuple.
   - `y`: This is the second element of the current test case tuple.
   - `arr`: This is the array associated with the current test case.

Since we are starting a new iteration, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will be taken from the next test case in `test_cases`.

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the values of these variables for the next test case.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` reflects the cumulative sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in `arr`, and `residue_map` records how many times each unique pair `(num % x, num % y)` appears in `arr`, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the first element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, and `arr` is the next test case array.**
