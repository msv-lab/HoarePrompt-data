Output State: **`count` is 6, `results` is [6], `residue_map` is `{(2, 2): 3}`, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array minus 3, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is the next test case array without the first three elements, `num` is the fourth element of `arr`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is (num % x, num % y).**

Explanation: The line `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` (which is 6) to the list `results`. This means that `results` now contains `[6]`. All other variables (`residue_map`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `r_y`, and `current_key`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
