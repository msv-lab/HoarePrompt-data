Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `arr` must have at least one element, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `residue_map[(num % x, num % y)]` is incremented by 1, and `r_y` is `num % y`**.

Explanation:
- The line `residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1` increments the count of the key `current_key` in the dictionary `residue_map`. Since `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, the value of `residue_map[(num % x, num % y)]` is incremented by 1.
- The `count` is also updated by adding the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1` to its current value. Here, `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y`, so `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` is added by 1 and then added to `count`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
