Output State: **`count` is 0 + residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0); `results` is [0]; `residue_map` is {(num % x, num % y): 1}; `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array; `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple; `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple; `arr` is the next test case array without the first element; `num` is the second element of `arr`; `r_y` is num % y.**

In this output state, the `count` variable is updated by adding the value returned by `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` to its current value (which is 0). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
