Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \); `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged. Therefore, `test_cases` is still a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \). The variable `results` is now an empty list.
