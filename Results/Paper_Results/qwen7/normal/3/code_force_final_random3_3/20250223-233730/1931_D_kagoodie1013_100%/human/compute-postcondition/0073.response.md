Output State: `results` is a list containing the total count of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in all arrays in `test_cases`, `count` is the same as the final value in `results`, `residue_map` is a dictionary that records the frequency of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` derived from all elements in all arrays in `test_cases`, `n` is the number of elements in the last array of `test_cases` minus the total number of elements processed so far, `x` is the second element of the last test case tuple, `y` is the third element of the last test case tuple, `arr` is the last array in `test_cases` without the first `n` elements, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`, and `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)` for the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `results` will contain the total count of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair found across all input arrays, and `residue_map` will show how many times each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair appeared. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` will reflect the state just before the loop finishes processing the last test case.
