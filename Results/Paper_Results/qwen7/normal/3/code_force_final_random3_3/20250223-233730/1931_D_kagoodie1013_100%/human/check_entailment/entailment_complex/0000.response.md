Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and organizes it into test cases.
2. The `func_1` function iterates through each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs using the given conditions.
3. For each element in the array, it computes the remainders \( r_x \) and \( r_y \) as specified.
4. It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the frequency of each unique pair \((r_x, r_y)\).
5. The count of beautiful pairs for each test case is calculated by summing up the values in `residue_map` for each unique pair.
6. The function returns the correct number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
