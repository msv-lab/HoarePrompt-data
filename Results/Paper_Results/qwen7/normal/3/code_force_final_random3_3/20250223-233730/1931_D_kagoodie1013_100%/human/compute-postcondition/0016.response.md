Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `num` from the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the current iteration**:
   - `test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `count` is the sum of the previous count and the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
   - `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` having a value of 1.
   - `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`.
   - `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`.
   - `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`.
   - `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `arr` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `num` will be the next element in `arr`.
   - `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `residue_map`, `current_key`, `r_x`, and `r_y` will be updated based on the new `num`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should include the following adjustments:

- `num` will be the next element in `arr`.
- `count` will be updated based on the new `num`.
- `current_key` will be updated to `num % x, num % y`.
- `r_x` will be the remainder of `-num % x`.
- `r_y` will be the remainder of `num % y`.
- `residue_map[current_key]` will be incremented by 1.

Since the exact values of `num`, `x`, `y`, and other variables depend on the specific iteration, we cannot provide concrete values without knowing the next element in `arr`. However, we can describe the general state.

**State:**
- `test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `count` is the sum of the previous count and the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, where `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` and `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`.
- `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` having a value of 1, where `new_r_x` and `new_r_y` are derived from the new `num`.
- `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`.
- `num` is the next element in `arr`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the sum of the previous count and the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, where `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` and `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` having a value of 1, where `new_r_x` and `new_r_y` are derived from the new `num`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
