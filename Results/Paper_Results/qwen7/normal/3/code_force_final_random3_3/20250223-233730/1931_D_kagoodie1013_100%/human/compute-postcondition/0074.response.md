Output State: `results` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `count` values from all iterations, `count` is the total sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in all arrays in `test_cases`, `residue_map` is a dictionary that records the frequency of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` derived from all elements in all arrays in `test_cases`, `n` is the number of elements in the last test case array minus the number of elements processed so far, `x` is the third element of the last test case tuple, `y` is the third element of the last test case tuple, `arr` is the last test case array without the elements already processed, `num` is the current element being processed in the last array, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`, and `current_key` is the key `(num % x, num % y)` for the last element processed.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `results` will contain the final count of occurrences of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair across all arrays in `test_cases`. The `residue_map` will show how many times each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair appeared in the arrays. The remaining variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key`) will reflect the state just before the last element of the last array is processed.
