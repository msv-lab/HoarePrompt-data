Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input and splits it into individual test cases. Each test case is stored as a tuple containing the size of the array \( n \), the integers \( x \) and \( y \), and the array itself. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the frequency of each unique pair \((r_x, r_y)\).
   - It then iterates through each element in the array, calculates the remainders \( r_x \) and \( r_y \), and uses these to update the count and the residue map.
   - The count is incremented by the value of the residue map for the current pair \((r_x, r_y)\), which effectively counts how many previous elements had the same remainders.
   - The current element’s pair \((r_x, r_y)\) is added to the residue map, updating its frequency.

3. **Output**: The function appends the final count for each test case to the `results` list and returns this list at the end.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly identifies and counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case according to the problem statement. There are no logical errors or omissions in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
