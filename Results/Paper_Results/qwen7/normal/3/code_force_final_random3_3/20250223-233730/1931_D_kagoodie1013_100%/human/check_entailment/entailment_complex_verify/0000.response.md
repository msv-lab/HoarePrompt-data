### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into parts.
   - It then iterates through the test cases, parsing each one and storing them in `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - For each test case, it initializes a `count` variable to zero.
   - It creates a `residue_map` to keep track of the frequency of each unique pair \((r_x, r_y)\).
   - For each number in the array, it calculates \( r_x = -num \mod x \) and \( r_y = num \mod y \).
   - It checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) exists in the `residue_map` and adds the count to `count`.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current number's pair \((r_x, r_y)\).

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The core logic of the program is to use the properties of modular arithmetic to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - The formula \( r_x = -num \mod x \) ensures that \( a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \mod x \).
   - The formula \( r_y = num \mod y \) ensures that \( a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \mod y \).
   - By maintaining a `residue_map` of these pairs, the program can quickly determine how many times each pair has occurred, thus counting the number of beautiful pairs efficiently.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles large inputs within the given constraints (up to \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \) elements per array and up to \( 10^9 \) for \( x \) and \( y \)).
   - The use of `residue_map` ensures that the program runs in linear time relative to the number of elements in the array, making it efficient.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs based on the given conditions. There are no logical errors or inefficiencies that would cause the program to fail under any of the specified constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations.
