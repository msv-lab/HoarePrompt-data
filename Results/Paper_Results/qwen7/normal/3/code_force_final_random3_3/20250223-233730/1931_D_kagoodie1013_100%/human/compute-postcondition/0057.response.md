Output State: **`count` is 0, `results` is `[0]`, `residue_map` is `{(num % x, num % y): 1}`, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is the next test case array, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_y = num % y`, `current_key = (num % x, num % y)`**

Explanation: The code updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count of the current key `(num % x, num % y)` by 1. Since the key is being added for the first time, its initial value is 0, and after incrementing, it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
