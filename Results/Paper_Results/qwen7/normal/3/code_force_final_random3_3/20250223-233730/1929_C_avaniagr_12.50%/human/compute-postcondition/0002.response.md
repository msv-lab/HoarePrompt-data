Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to the first integer from input, `x` is updated to the second integer from input, `a` is updated to the third integer from input**.

Explanation: The code `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. The values of `t` and the original ranges of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, but the specific values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are now the integers entered by the user.
