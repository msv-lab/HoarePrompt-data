Postcondition: `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 0 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` will be the result of repeatedly adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself for `x + 1` times, where `x` is the number of iterations specified initially. If `x` equals `k - 1`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3` if it was initially greater than or equal to `x + 3`, otherwise `x` is less than `k - 1`. If `x` does not equal `k - 1`, then `z` will be the result of the specified operation, and `a` remains greater than or equal to `z` if it was initially greater than or equal to `z`, otherwise `a` is less than `z`.
