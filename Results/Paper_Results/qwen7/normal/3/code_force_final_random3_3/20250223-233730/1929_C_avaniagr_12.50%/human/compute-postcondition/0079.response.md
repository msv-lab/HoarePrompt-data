Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` must be at least 5, `z` is 2 * (`z` // (k - 1) + 1)**

Explanation: The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates the value of `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. However, since the initial value of `z` and the value of `k` are not specified, we express the new value of `z` in terms of itself and `k`. The initial state of `i` and `x` remains unchanged.
