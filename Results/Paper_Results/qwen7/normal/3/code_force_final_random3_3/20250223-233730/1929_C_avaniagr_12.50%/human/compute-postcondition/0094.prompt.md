Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = 0
        for i in range(x + 1):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` is updated to the first integer from input, `x` is updated to the second integer from input, `a` is updated to the third integer from input, and if the current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`, then `a` is either unchanged if it is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, or `a` is less than `x + 1`. Otherwise, `z` will be the result of repeatedly adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself for `x + 1` times, where `x` is the number of iterations specified initially. If `x` equals `k - 1`, then `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3` if it was initially greater than or equal to `x + 3`, otherwise `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` does not equal `k - 1`, then `z` will be the result of the specified operation, and `a` remains greater than or equal to `z` if it was initially greater than or equal to `z`, otherwise `a` is less than `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `t` is greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`. If `x < k - 1`, then `t` remains unchanged. If `x == k - 1`, then `x` remains unchanged, `z` is either 5 or 6 depending on whether `a` is less than 5 or greater than or equal to 5, and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `x` is set to 2, `z` is either 5 or 6 depending on whether `a` is less than 5 or greater than or equal to 5, and `i` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `z` is either 5 or 6 depending on whether `a` is less than 5 or greater than or equal to 5, `i` is equal to `x + 1` and `t` is `t - 1`. If `x < k - 1`, then `i` is `x + 1` and `z` is updated by performing the operation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to `x + 1`. If `x == k - 1`, then `i` remains as `t - 1` and `z` is unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
