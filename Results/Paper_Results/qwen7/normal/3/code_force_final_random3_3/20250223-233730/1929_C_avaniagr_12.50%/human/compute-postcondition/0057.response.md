Output State: `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `t` is now `t - 1`, `z` is 3, `i` is `x + 1`, `x` must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 100\).

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = x`, which means it will execute `x + 1` times. Given that the loop has executed 3 times as per the provided states, it implies that `x + 1 = 3`, so `x = 2`. After all iterations of the loop, the variable `z` will be incremented by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration, resulting in `z = 3`. The variable `i` will be equal to `x + 1`, which is `3` in this case. All other variables (`k`, `x`, `a`, `t`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
