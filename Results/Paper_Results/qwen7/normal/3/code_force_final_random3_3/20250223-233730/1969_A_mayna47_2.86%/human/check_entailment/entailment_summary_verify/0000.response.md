### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
- Each friend \(i\) will only come if both \(i\) and their best friend \(p_i\) receive invitations.
- The function summary indicates that the function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers, and it checks specific conditions to determine the minimum number of invitations.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1`:
  - Reads an integer `n` and a list `p`.
  - Checks if `n` is 2, in which case it prints 2.
  - If `n` is not 2, it iterates through the list and checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i` for any `i`.
  - If this condition is found to be false, it prints 3.
  - The function does not return any value.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   v = [0] * (n + 1)
   v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   - This part initializes a list `v` with zeros and reads the list of best friends into `v`.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   ```python
   if n == 2:
       print(2)
   ```
   - If there are only 2 friends, the minimum number of invitations needed is 2, as both friends must receive invitations.

3. **Cycle Detection:**
   ```python
   else:
       for i in range(1, n + 1):
           if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
               print(2)
               return
   ```
   - This loop checks if there exists a pair of friends `(i, p_i)` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a pair is found, it means these two friends form a cycle of length 2, and thus only 2 invitations are needed.

4. **Default Case:**
   ```python
   print(3)
   ```
   - If no such pair is found, it prints 3, indicating that at least 3 invitations are needed.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly handles the special case when `n == 2`.
- The main logic of checking for cycles of length 2 is correct. If such a cycle exists, only 2 invitations are needed.
- However, the program does not handle cases where the structure of the best friends' relationships forms a cycle that includes more than two friends. For example, in the input:
  ```
  4
  2 3 4 1
  ```
  - Friends 1, 2, 3, and 4 form a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1.
  - The program incorrectly prints 3, but the correct answer should be 2. By sending invitations to friends 2 and 4, both friends 2 and 4 will attend the party.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, specifically those involving cycles of length greater than 2.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where the best friends' relationships form cycles of length greater than 2.
