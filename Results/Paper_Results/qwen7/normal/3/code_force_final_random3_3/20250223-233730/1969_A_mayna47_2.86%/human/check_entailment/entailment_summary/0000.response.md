Reasoning:
- The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
- The main issues are:
  1. The function `func_1()` is not properly defined to handle the logic as described in the problem statement.
  2. The condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is incorrect. This condition checks if the triple relationship forms a cycle of length 3, but the problem requires forming at least 2 friends at the party.
  3. The logic for handling different cases (like when `n == 2`) is not implemented correctly.
  4. The function does not handle all edge cases and does not ensure that at least 2 friends are invited.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
