Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 < n ≤ 50, and `p` is a list of n integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ n, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length n+1 where the first element is 0 and the next n elements are integers inputted from the user.**
