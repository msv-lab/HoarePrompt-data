You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
        print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is 4, `n` is between 3 and 50 inclusive, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop continues to iterate from `i = 1` to `i = n`. After three iterations, `i` has been incremented to 4. For each iteration, the loop checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If this condition is not met, `i` is incremented and the check continues. Since the condition was not met in the first three iterations, it will continue to be checked with `i` now being 4. The values of `n` and the condition `v[v[v[i]]] != i` remain unchanged as no modifications were made to these variables within the loop.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ `n` and `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length `n+1` where the first element is 0 and the next `n` elements are integers inputted from the user. If `n` equals 2, then `n` is 2 and `v` is a list of length 3 with the first element as 0 and the next two elements as integers inputted from the user. If `n` is between 3 and 50, `i` is 4, and the condition `v[v[v[4]]]` is not equal to 4.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Friend List Initialization**: In `func_1()`, the program initializes a list `v` with zeros and then updates it with the input values. This is done correctly.
3. **Special Case Handling**: For `n == 2`, the program prints `2` which is correct because both friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come.
4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and are also best friends with each other indirectly (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, which is correct.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. However, this logic needs to be checked more carefully.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple pairs might satisfy the condition but only checks for one specific pair.
   - The program does not ensure that the minimum number of invitations is always printed. For example, in the third test case, the program should check if inviting just one friend is enough, but it directly prints `2`.

### Analysis:
- The program fails to correctly handle cases where inviting just one friend is sufficient. For example, in the third test case (`2 1`), inviting just friend 1 would suffice, but the program incorrectly prints `2`.
- The logic for checking the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is incomplete and does not cover all scenarios where inviting just one friend might be enough.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not always find the minimum number of invitations needed.

### Correctness:
**False**
