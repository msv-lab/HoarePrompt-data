You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is 4, `n` is between 3 and 50 inclusive, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop continues to iterate from `i = 1` to `i = n`. After three iterations, `i` has been incremented to 4. For each iteration, the loop checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If this condition is not met, `i` is incremented and the check continues. Since the condition was not met in the first three iterations, it will continue to be checked with `i` now being 4. The values of `n` and the condition `v[v[v[i]]] != i` remain unchanged as no modifications were made to these variables within the loop.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ `n` and `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length `n+1` where the first element is 0 and the next `n` elements are integers inputted from the user. If `n` equals 2, then `n` is 2 and `v` is a list of length 3 with the first element as 0 and the next two elements as integers inputted from the user. If `n` is between 3 and 50, `i` is 4, and the condition `v[v[v[4]]]` is not equal to 4.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.

Case_3: The program does not return any value as there is no expression or value being returned in the provided code snippet.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
