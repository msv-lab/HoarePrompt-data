### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Friend List Initialization**: In `func_1()`, the program initializes a list `v` with zeros and then updates it with the input values. This is done correctly.
3. **Special Case Handling**: For `n == 2`, the program prints `2` which is correct because both friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come.
4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and are also best friends with each other indirectly (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, which is correct.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. However, this logic needs to be checked more carefully.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where inviting just one friend is sufficient. For example, in the third test case (`2 1`), inviting just friend 1 would suffice, but the program incorrectly prints `2`.
   - The program does not ensure that the minimum number of invitations is always printed. For example, in the third test case, the program should check if inviting just one friend is enough, but it directly prints `2`.

### Detailed Analysis:

Let's break down the logic and edge cases:

1. **Initialization and Input**:
   - `v` is initialized to `[0, p_1, p_2, ..., p_n]`.
   - The program correctly reads the number of friends `n` and their best friends `p`.

2. **Special Case `n == 2`**:
   - If `n == 2`, the program prints `2` because both friends must be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come. This is correct.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks if there exists a pair of friends `(i, j)` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i` and `v[v[v[j]]] == j`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. This is incorrect because it does not check if inviting just one friend is sufficient.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n == 2`, the program should print `2` if both friends are each other's best friends, otherwise, it should print `3`.
   - For `n > 2`, the program should check if inviting just one friend is sufficient. For example, in the third test case (`2 1`), inviting just friend 1 would suffice, but the program incorrectly prints `2`.

### Corrected Logic:

To ensure the minimum number of invitations is printed, we need to check if inviting just one friend is sufficient before printing `3`.

Here is the corrected logic:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if n == 2
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
        return
    
    # Check if inviting just one friend is sufficient
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[i] == i:
            print(1)
            return
    
    # Check if there exists a pair (i, j) such that v[v[v[i]]] == i and v[v[v[j]]] == j
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    
    # If none of the above conditions are met, print 3
    print(3)
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not always find the minimum number of invitations needed. The corrected logic ensures that the minimum number of invitations is printed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate.
