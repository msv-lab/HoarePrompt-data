Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is not properly defined to handle the logic:**
   - The function `func_1` should take the input values and determine the minimum number of invitations needed.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of invitations.

2. **Incorrect logic for handling the cases:**
   - The program checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i` to determine if two friends can be invited. This condition is not sufficient to ensure that at least 2 friends will come to the party.
   - The logic for handling different cases (e.g., when `n == 2`, or when no two friends can be invited such that their best friends also get invited) is not correctly implemented.

3. **Output for certain test cases is incorrect:**
   - For example, in the third test case where `n = 2` and `p = [2, 1]`, the expected output is 2, but the program incorrectly prints 3.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Create a mapping from friend to their best friend
    best_friends = {i: p[i-1] for i in range(1, n+1)}

    # Find cycles in the friendship graph
    visited = set()
    min_invitations = float('inf')

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i not in visited:
            cycle_size = 0
            current_friend = i
            while current_friend not in visited:
                visited.add(current_friend)
                current_friend = best_friends[current_friend]
                cycle_size += 1

            # If the cycle size is 2, we need 2 invitations
            if cycle_size == 2:
                min_invitations = 2
                break
            # Otherwise, we need cycle_size invitations
            else:
                min_invitations = min(min_invitations, cycle_size)

    if min_invitations == float('inf'):
        min_invitations = 3

    print(min_invitations)
```

This corrected version correctly identifies cycles in the friendship graph and determines the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
