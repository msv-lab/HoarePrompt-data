### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - Each friend \(i\) will only come if both \(i\) and their best friend \(p_i\) receive an invitation.
   - If \(v[v[v[i]]] == i\), it means there is a cycle of length 3 where each friend in the cycle will come if any one of them receives an invitation.
   - Otherwise, we need at least 2 friends to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the array `v` representing the best friends.
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop, which is incorrect.
   - The main logic is in `func_1()`:
     - It initializes an array `v` with zeros.
     - It updates `v` with the best friends' indices.
     - If `n == 2`, it prints 2 directly.
     - Otherwise, it checks if there is a cycle of length 3 using the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If true, it prints 2 and returns.
     - If no such cycle exists, it prints 3.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called but never used in the main loop. This is a logical error.
   - The main loop should call `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The logic inside `func_1()` seems correct for identifying cycles and determining the minimum number of invitations.

4. **Correcting the Code:**
   - Replace the unused `func_1()` with the logic inside it in the main loop.

### Corrected Code:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
```

### Conclusion:
The original code has a logical error due to the unused `func_1()`. However, the logic inside `func_1()` is correct. After correcting the main loop to use this logic, the solution works as intended.

**Correctness: False** (due to the unused `func_1()`)

If you make the necessary correction, the correctness would be **True**.
