Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is between 3 and 50 inclusive.
   - `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.

5. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now 3 and `n` is between 3 and 50, the loop can still continue as long as `n` is greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variables that change within the loop head are `i` and `n`. The other conditions (`v[v[v[i]]]` not equal to `i`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is between 3 and 50 inclusive, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`**.
