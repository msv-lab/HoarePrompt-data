Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining when to propose a new problem and how many such problems are needed is flawed.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting New Problems**: The code increments `cnt` whenever `b[j] < a[i]`. However, this does not account for the fact that we need to replace elements in `a` with higher values until all `a[i] <= b[i]`.

2. **Proposing Problems**: The solution does not simulate the process of proposing a new problem and sorting the array `a` after each insertion, which is a crucial part of the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
- Iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.
- Whenever you find `b[j] < a[i]`, increment the count of new problems (`cnt`) and replace `a[i]` with `b[j]`.
- Continue this process until all elements in `a` satisfy `a[i] <= b[i]`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            while a[i] > b[i]:
                a.pop()
                a.insert(0, b[i])
                a.sort()
                cnt += 1
        
        print(cnt)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the array `a` is updated correctly after each new problem is proposed, and the count of new problems is accurately calculated.
