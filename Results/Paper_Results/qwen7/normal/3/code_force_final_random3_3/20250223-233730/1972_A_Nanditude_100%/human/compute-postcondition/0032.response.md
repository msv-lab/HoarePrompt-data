Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `cnt` is the count of elements in list `b` that are less than the element `a[i]`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
