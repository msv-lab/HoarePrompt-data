Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `j < n`, the next value of `j` will be 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `j`).
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant for the loop.
   - The postcondition related to `cnt` and `i` will be evaluated again in the next iteration based on the new value of `j`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - The postcondition for `cnt` and `i` will be re-evaluated based on the new value of `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and if `b[j] < a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1**.
