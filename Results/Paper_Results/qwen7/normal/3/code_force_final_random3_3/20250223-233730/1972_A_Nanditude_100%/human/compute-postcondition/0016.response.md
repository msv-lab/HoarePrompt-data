Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `cnt` is increased by 1.**

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `j` and `n` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. The condition `if b[j] < a[i]` and the assignment of `cnt` to 1 only apply when that condition is met, but since no such condition is given here, we assume `cnt` is simply incremented by 1.
