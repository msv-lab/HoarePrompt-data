Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `cnt` is 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user.**

The code `i = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `i`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, `cnt`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
