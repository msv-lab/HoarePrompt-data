Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads two sorted lists of integers `a` and `b` of the same length `n`. It then counts and prints the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` up to the current index `i`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the count for each case.**
