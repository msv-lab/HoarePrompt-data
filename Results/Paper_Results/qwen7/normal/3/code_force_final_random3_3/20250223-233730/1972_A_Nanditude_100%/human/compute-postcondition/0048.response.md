Output State: **`i` is 1 if `b[j] < a[i]`; otherwise, `i` is 2, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` is the same, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
