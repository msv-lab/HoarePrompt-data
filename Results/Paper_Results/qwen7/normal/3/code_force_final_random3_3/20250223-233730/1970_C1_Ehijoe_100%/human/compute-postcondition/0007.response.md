Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list, `i` is 0, `nodes[v]` includes `u`.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the value `u` to the list associated with the key `v` in the `nodes` dictionary. Initially, `nodes[u]` includes `v`, meaning `v` is in the list for key `u`. Now, `u` is added to the list for key `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
