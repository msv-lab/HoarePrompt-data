Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list, `i` is 0, `u` and `v` are integers obtained from input split by space.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, `empty`, `nodes`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The variables `u` and `v` have been updated to the integers obtained from the input split by a space.
