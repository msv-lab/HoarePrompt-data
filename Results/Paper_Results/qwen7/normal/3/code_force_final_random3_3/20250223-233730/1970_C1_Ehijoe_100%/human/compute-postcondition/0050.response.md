Output State: **`tree` now contains the current element `nodes[curr][1]` and `curr` is equal to `nodes[curr][1]`, and `tree` has one more element `nodes[curr][1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to `nodes[curr][1]`. Since `curr` was previously equal to `prev` and `tree` had one more element `curr`, `tree` now includes the new value of `curr`. The updated value of `curr` is also used in the description.
