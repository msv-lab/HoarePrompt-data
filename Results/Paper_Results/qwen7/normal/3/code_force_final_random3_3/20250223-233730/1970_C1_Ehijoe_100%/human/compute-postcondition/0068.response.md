Output State: **`tree` list includes the node `e`; `prev` holds the last node that was visited before `e`; `curr` is equal to `e`; `start` is an input integer; `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list; `moves` is `[idx, n - idx - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `moves` which contains two elements: `idx` and `n - idx - 1`. The values of `tree`, `prev`, `curr`, `start`, and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial states.
