Output State: **`curr` is appended to `tree`, `e` is not affected**.

The code appends the value of `curr` to the list `tree`. The value of `curr` is not equal to `e`, which remains unchanged. Therefore, `curr` is added to the list `tree`, and the relationship between `curr` and `e` remains as it was initially.
