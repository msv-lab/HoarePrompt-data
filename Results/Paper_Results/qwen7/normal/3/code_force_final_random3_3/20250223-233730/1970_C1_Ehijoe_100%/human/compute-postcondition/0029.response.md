Output State: **`nodes` must have at least one key, `key` is the next key in `nodes`, `ends` now contains the key that was appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the `key` (which is the next key in `nodes`) to the list `ends`. The initial conditions that `nodes` must have at least one key and `key` is the next key in `nodes` remain true. After executing the code, `ends` will contain the key that was just appended.
