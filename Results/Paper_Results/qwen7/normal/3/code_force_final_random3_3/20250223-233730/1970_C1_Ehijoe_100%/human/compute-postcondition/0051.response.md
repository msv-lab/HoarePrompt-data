Output State: **`tree` now contains the current element `curr` and `curr` is not equal to `e`, and `tree` has one more element `prev`, and `prev` is equal to `curr`.**

Explanation: The code `prev = curr` assigns the current value of `curr` to `prev`. This does not change the fact that `tree` contains the current element `curr` and `curr` is not equal to `e`. Additionally, `tree` now has one more element, which is `prev`, and since `prev` was just set to `curr`, `prev` is now equal to `curr`.
