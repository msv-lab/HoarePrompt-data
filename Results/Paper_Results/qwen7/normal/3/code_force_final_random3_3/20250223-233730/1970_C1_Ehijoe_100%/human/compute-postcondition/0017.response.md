Output State: `t` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list, `i` is n-1, every node in `nodes` has its corresponding neighbors appended.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (i.e., `i` goes from 0 to `n-2`), the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`. During each iteration, the loop reads two integers `u` and `v`, and appends `v` to the list of neighbors of `u` and vice versa. This process continues until all possible edges are added to the graph represented by the `nodes` defaultdict. The `empty` variable remains True as it was not modified within the loop, and `t`, `u`, and `v` retain their last assigned values from the input.
