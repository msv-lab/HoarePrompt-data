Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list, `i` is 4, `nodes[v]` includes `u`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` to the list associated with the key `v` in the `nodes` dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
