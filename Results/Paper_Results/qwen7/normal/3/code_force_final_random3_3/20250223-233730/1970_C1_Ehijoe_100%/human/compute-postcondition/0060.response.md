Output State: **`prev` is reassigned to the value of `nodes[curr][0]`, `e` is not affected**.

Explanation: The code reassigns the value of `curr` to `nodes[curr][0]`. This means that the current value of `curr` is replaced with whatever value is stored at the first index of the list located at `nodes[curr]`. The value of `prev` is updated to this new value of `curr`, while `e` remains unchanged.
