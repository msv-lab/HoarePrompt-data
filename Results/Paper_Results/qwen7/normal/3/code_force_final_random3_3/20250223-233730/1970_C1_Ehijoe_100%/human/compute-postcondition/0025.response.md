Output State: **`nodes` must have at least one key, `key` is the next key in `nodes`, `ends` now includes the current `key`.**

Explanation: The code `ends.append(key)` appends the current `key` to the list `ends`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ends` now contains the current `key` in addition to any previously existing elements.
