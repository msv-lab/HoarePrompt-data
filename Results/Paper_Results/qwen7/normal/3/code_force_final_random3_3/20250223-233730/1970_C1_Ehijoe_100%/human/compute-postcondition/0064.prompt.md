Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ends` list is now empty, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list before it was emptied, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list before it was emptied, `tree` is a list containing the element `s`, `prev` is equal to `s`, `curr` is the first element of the list `nodes[s]`.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `tree` now contains the current element `curr`. If `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, then `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][1]`. Otherwise, `curr` remains as `nodes[curr][0]` and `prev` is updated to `nodes[curr][0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `tree` now contains the current element either `nodes[curr][1]` or `nodes[curr][0]`, depending on whether `nodes[curr][0]` equals `prev`. If `nodes[curr][0]` equals `prev`, then `tree` has one more element `nodes[curr][1]` and `curr` is equal to `nodes[curr][1]`. Otherwise, `tree` has one more element `prev` and `prev` is equal to `nodes[curr][0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `prev` is reassigned to either the value of `nodes[curr][1]` or `nodes[curr][0]`, depending on whether `nodes[curr][0]` equals `prev`. In both cases, `e` remains unaffected.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
