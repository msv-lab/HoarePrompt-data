Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list, `i` is 4, `nodes[u]` includes `v`.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list that `nodes[u]` points to. Since `u` and `v` are both input integers, they are updated to the new input values. All other variables remain unchanged.
