Postcondition: `tree` list includes the node `e`; `prev` holds the last node that was visited before `e`; `curr` is equal to `e`; `start` is an input integer; `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list; `moves` is `[idx, n - idx - 1]`. If at least one move in `moves` is an odd number, the condition remains as is. If all elements in `moves` are even numbers, the condition remains as is.
