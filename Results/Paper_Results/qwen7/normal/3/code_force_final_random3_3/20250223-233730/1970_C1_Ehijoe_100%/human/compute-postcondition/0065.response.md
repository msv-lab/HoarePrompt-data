Output State: **The `tree` list now includes the node `e`; `prev` holds the last node that was visited before `e`; `curr` is equal to `e`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(e)` adds the node `e` to the `tree` list. This means that the path from the start node `s` to the end node `e` is now traced up to and including `e`. The `prev` variable still holds the last node that was visited before `e`, and `curr` is set to `e` at the end of the loop.
