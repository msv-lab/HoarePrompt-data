Output State: **`tree` now contains the current element `curr`; `prev` is equal to `curr`**.

Explanation: The code `prev = curr` assigns the current value of `curr` to `prev`. This means that `prev` now holds whatever value `curr` had before the assignment. The value of `nodes[curr][0]` being equal to `prev` remains unchanged from the initial state.
