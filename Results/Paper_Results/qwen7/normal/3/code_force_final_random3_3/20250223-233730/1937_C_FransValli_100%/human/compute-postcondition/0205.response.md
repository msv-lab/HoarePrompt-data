Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is added to `arr`, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` is now either `[i_new, i_new]` or `[0, i_new, i]`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input value from the user, `mini` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `i` is `i_new`, `arr` will now contain `i_new` and the newly appended `i` (which is also `i_new`). The other variables remain unchanged.
