Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `n` must be at least 4, `res` is an input string, `arr` contains `i_prev + 1`, and `i` is appended to `arr`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `i` (which is `i_prev + 1` from the initial state) to the list `arr`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1, making it `i_prev + 2`. The values of `n`, `res`, and the content of `arr` remain as per the initial state, except that `i_prev + 1` is now included in `arr`.
