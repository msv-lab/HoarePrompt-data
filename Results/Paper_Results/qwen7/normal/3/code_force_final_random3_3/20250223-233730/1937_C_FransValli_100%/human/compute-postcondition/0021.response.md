Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be at least 4, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `maxi` is `n-1`, and `res` is an input string, where the value of `res` is '<' for all iterations from 1 to `n-1`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. After all iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`, and since `maxi` is updated to `i` whenever `res` is '<', `maxi` will also be `n-1`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain as described, with `n` being at least 4 to ensure the loop runs at least three times. The value of `res` remains an input string, but based on the loop logic, it would be '<' for all iterations.
