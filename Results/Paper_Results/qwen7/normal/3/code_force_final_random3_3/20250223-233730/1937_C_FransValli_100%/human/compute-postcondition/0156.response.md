Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. This means the loop will run for as many times as the user inputs (converted to an integer).

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `res` is the final input string received after the last iteration.
   - `arr` must have at least `n` elements.
   - `mini` is now equal to the last element of `arr` if `res` is equal to '>', otherwise `mini` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand what happens in each iteration**:
   - The loop runs for a number of times specified by the user input.
   - Each iteration does not directly modify the values of `i` or `n` since `i` is set to `n` at the beginning of each iteration and `n` is derived from user input.
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the given information, it seems that the loop body might involve some operations that could affect `res` and `arr`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is set to `n` at the beginning of each iteration, `i` will be `n` again at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` will be the user input for the next iteration.
   - `res` will be updated based on the loop body.
   - `arr` will be updated based on the loop body.
   - `mini` will be updated based on the condition `res == '>'`.

Given these points, the state adjustments for the next iteration would be:

- `i` will be `n` again.
- `n` will be the new user input.
- `res` will be updated based on the loop body.
- `arr` will be updated based on the loop body.
- `mini` will be updated based on the condition `res == '>'`.

Since the exact updates to `res` and `arr` are not provided, we can only say that they will be updated according to the loop body logic.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the new user input, `res` is updated based on the loop body, `arr` is updated based on the loop body, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`**
