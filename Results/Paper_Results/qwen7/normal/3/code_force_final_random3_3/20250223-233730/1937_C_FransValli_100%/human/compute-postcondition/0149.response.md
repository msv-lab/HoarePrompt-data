Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
- `res` is a new input string, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `arr` must have at least 4 elements.
- `mini` is equal to the third element of `arr`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mini` is the third element of `arr`.
- `item` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information.

Given the information, we can only determine the parts of the print statement that are explicitly defined.

Output: **'? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]** (where `[mini]` is the third element of `arr` and `[item]` is undefined).
