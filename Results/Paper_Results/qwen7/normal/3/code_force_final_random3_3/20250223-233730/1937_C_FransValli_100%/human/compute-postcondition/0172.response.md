Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) because the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until it reaches `n`. 

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `maxi` is 2
   - `i` is 2
   - `res` is an input string
   - `arr` is updated based on the loop body
   - `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will check if `i < n` to decide whether to continue.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.
   - The value of `n` must be such that `i < n` holds true, meaning `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Considering the Conditions Inside the Loop**:
   - If `res` is equal to '<', `maxi` remains 2 and `i` remains 2.
   - If `res` is not '<', `mini` and `arr` are updated based on the condition `res == '>'`.

Since the loop head only involves `i` and `n`, and the conditions inside the loop do not affect the loop head directly, the only adjustments needed are for `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`maxi` is 2, `i` is 3, `res` is an input string, `arr` is updated based on the loop body, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`, and `n` must be greater than 3**
