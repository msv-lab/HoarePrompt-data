Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. This means that for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If `res` is equal to '<', then `arr` is a list containing the element 1. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged and is not equal to '<'.

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0.
   - The state of `res` and `arr` does not change because the loop body is omitted and no operations are specified that would affect these variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**.
