Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `res` is the new input string which is equal to '>', `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element of `arr`, `mini` is the second element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The line `mini = item` assigns the value of `item` (which is the second element of `arr`) to the variable `mini`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
