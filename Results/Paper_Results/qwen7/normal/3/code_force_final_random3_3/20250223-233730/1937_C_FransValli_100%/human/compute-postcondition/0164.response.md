Postcondition: `maxi` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `res` is an input string, `arr` is updated based on the loop body, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`. If `res` equals '<', then `maxi` remains 1, `i` remains 1, and `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.
