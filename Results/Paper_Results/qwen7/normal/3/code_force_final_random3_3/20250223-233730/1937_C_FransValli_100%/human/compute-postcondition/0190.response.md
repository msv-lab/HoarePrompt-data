Postcondition: `total` is 10, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is unchanged, `arr` is either `[i]` or `[0, i]`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times, and `res` is set to '=' if the if condition `res == '<'` is met.
