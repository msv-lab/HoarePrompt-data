Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is unchanged, `arr` is [i], `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times, the current value of `res` is '<'**.

Explanation: The code `arr = [i]` changes the list `arr` to contain only the element `i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
