Output State: **`i` is a value in the range [1, n-1], `n` must be at least 4, `res` is a string that is not equal to '<', `arr` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `i` is in the range [1, n-1] and `n` is at least 4, appending `i` to `arr` means `arr` now contains `i`. The values of `n` and `res` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
