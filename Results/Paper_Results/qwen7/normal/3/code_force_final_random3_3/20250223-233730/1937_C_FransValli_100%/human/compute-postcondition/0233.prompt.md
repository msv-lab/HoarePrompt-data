Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. Additionally, the sequence p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    maxi = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            maxi = i
    arr = [0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            arr = [i]
        elif res == '=':
            arr.append(i)
    mini = arr[0]
    for item in arr[1:]:
        print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '>':
            mini = item
    print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `item` is now `arr[n-1]`, `mini` is the minimum value encountered in the array `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` based on the user's input ('>') comparisons during each iteration, and `res` is an input string reflecting the user's choice ('<' or '>') for each comparison.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `res` is the final input string received after the last iteration, `arr` must have at least `n` elements, `mini` is now equal to the last element of `arr` if `res` is equal to '>', otherwise `mini` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is 10, `res` is the user's input value from the last iteration, `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1` in any order, `mini` retains its original value (which could either be `n-1` or undefined based on user inputs), `maxi` equals `n-1`, and `i` equals `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
