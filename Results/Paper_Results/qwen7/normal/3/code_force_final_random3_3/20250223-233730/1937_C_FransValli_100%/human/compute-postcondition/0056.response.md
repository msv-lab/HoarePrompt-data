Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` must be at least 4, `res` is an input string, and `arr` will contain a list of integers starting from the smallest index `i_prev` up to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Each iteration prints a query and waits for user input. Based on the input, `arr` is updated. If the input is '<', `arr` is set to contain the current value of `i`. If the input is '=', `i` is appended to `arr`. Since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`, `arr` will contain all integers from the smallest index (determined by the first input) up to `n-1`.
