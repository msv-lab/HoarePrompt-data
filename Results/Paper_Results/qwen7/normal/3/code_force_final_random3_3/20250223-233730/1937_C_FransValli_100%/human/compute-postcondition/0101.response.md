Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `res` is an input string, and `maxi` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n`, and `maxi` will be updated to the highest index `i` where the condition `res == '<'` was met. Since the loop increments `i` and updates `maxi` only when `res` is '<', and given that the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`, `maxi` will be `n-1` if the condition was met for all iterations. If the condition was not met for any `i`, `maxi` would still be 0, but since we know it has been updated at least once (as per the given states), `maxi` will be `n-1`. The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to run at all, and `res` remains an input string throughout the loop.
