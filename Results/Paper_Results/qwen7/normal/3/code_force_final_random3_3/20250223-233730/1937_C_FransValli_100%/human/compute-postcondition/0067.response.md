Output State: **`arr` must have at least 3 elements, `item` is `arr[2]`, `res` is an input string, `mini` is unchanged if `res` was '>' previously, `res` is an input value**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. The other variables (`arr`, `item`, and `mini`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
