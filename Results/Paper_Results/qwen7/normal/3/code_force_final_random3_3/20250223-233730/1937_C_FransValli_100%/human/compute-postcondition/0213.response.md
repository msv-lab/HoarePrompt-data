Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is explicitly stated to be 10.
- `res` is an input value from the user for the last iteration.
- `arr` must have at least 2 elements, but no specific values are given for `mini` or `item`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

Given the information, we know that `mini` and `item` are not explicitly defined with values in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we can describe them based on typical usage in such contexts.

Since `mini` and `item` are not defined, they could be any values depending on the context of the program. For the sake of this explanation, let's assume they are placeholders for some values that would be determined during the execution of the program.

Output: **'? mini mini item item' (where `mini` and `item` are values determined during the program's execution)**
