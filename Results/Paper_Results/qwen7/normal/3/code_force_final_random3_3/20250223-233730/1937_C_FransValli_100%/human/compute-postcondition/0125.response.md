Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 3.
- `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified.
- `res` and `arr` remain unchanged from their previous state.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown of the values that will be printed:
- `'?'`: This is a literal string that will be printed.
- `maxi`: The value of `maxi` is not explicitly given, so we'll keep it as `maxi`.
- `arr[0]`: Since `arr` remains unchanged, `arr[0]` retains its previous value.
- `maxi`: Again, this is the same `maxi` as mentioned earlier.
- `i`: According to the state, `i` is set to 3.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 3'**
