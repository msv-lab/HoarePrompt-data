Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means that the loop will iterate based on the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as the input value is a positive integer. Given the constraints, `t` (which is the input) should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**: Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range. The initial state of `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), but we need to explicitly state this condition.

4. **Adjust the States**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `t`, which must be a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)**
