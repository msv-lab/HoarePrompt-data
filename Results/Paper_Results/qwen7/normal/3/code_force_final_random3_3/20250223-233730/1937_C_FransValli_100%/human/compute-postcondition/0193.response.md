Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `total` is 10.
   - `i` is `i + 1`, but since `i` is not explicitly defined, we need to consider its context. Typically, this would mean `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is unchanged, but it is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value.
   - `arr` is either `[i]` or `[0, i]`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` could be `[1]` or `[0, 1]`.
   - `maxi` is `n-1`. Again, `n` is not defined, so we cannot determine `maxi` precisely.
   - `res` is an input string, but its value is not specified.
   - `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times. If `res` is not `'>'`, `mini` remains unchanged.
   - `res` is set to `=` if the condition `res == '<'` is met.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`.
   - `'?'` is a literal string.
   - `maxi` is `n-1`, but since `n` is not defined, we cannot determine `maxi` precisely.
   - `arr[0]` is either `1` or `0`, depending on the value of `i` after incrementing.
   - `maxi` is again `n-1`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`, so it is the value of `i` after being incremented by 1.

Given the lack of specific values for `n` and `res`, we can only describe the output in terms of the known variables and conditions.

Output: **'? [n-1] [1 or 0] [n-1] [i+1]** (where `n-1` is the value of `maxi`, `[1 or 0]` is the first element of `arr`, and `[i+1]` is the value of `i` after incrementing by 1).
