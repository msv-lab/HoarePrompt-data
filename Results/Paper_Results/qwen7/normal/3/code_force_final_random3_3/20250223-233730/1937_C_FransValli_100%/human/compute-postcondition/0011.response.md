Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `maxi` is 1.
- `res` is an input string with the value '<'.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `maxi` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `maxi` and `i`, repeated twice.

Output: **'? 1 1 2 2'**
