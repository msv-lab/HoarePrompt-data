Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a sequence p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} which is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. The function returns nothing explicitly but operates on the given sequence and integer values.**

However, since the problem statement does not specify any particular operation or return value beyond the constraints, the focus is on the parameters and their constraints rather than the exact functionality.
