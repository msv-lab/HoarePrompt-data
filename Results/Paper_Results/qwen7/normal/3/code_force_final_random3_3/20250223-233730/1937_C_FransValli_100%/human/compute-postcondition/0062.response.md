Output State: **`arr` must have at least 2 elements, `item` is `arr[1]`, `res` is an input string, the current value of `res` is '>', `mini` is `arr[1]`**

Explanation: The line `mini = item` assigns the value of `item` (which is `arr[1]`) to the variable `mini`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
