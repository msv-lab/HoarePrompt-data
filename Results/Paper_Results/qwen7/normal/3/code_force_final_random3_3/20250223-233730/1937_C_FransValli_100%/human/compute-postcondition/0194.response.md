Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `arr` is either `[i]` or `[0, i]`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times, and `res` is set to '=' if the condition `res == '<'` is met, `res` is now an input value from user.**

The code `res = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. The other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `maxi`, `mini`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `res` is now dependent on the user's input.
