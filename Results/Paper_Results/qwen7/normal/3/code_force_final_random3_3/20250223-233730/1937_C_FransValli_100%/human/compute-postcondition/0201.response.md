Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `total` is 10
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (let's denote the new value as `i_new`)
   - `n` remains unchanged
   - `arr` becomes either `[i]` or `[0, i]` depending on the condition in the if statement
   - `maxi` is `n-1`
   - `res` is an input value from the user
   - `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'` if the loop executes `n-1` times, and `res` is set to '=' if the condition `res == '<'` is met.

4. **Determine the New Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` (denoted as `i_new`) is `i + 1`.

5. **Adjust Other States**:
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `arr` will be updated based on the condition in the if statement, but since we don't know the exact condition, we'll keep it as `[i]` or `[0, i]`.
   - `maxi` remains `n-1` because `n` hasn't changed.
   - `res` is still an input value from the user.
   - `mini` will be updated if the loop executes `n-1` times and `res == '>'`, otherwise, it will remain unchanged.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `total` is still 10.
   - `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `arr` could be `[i + 1]` or `[0, i + 1]`.
   - `maxi` is still `n-1`.
   - `res` is still an input value from the user.
   - `mini` will be updated if the loop executes `n-1` times and `res == '>'`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` could be `[i + 1]` or `[0, i + 1]`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input value from the user, `mini` will be updated if the loop executes `n-1` times and `res == '>'`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.**

For simplicity, let's denote `i + 1` as `i_new`:

State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `i_new`, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` could be `[i_new]` or `[0, i_new]`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input value from the user, `mini` will be updated if the loop executes `n-1` times and `res == '>'`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.**
