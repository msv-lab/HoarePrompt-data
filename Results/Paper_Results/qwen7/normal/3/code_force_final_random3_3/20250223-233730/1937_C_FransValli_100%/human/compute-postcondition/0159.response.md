Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**: From the given state, `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is an input integer.
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive), meaning `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

Given this information, let's analyze the necessary adjustments:

- **Variable `i`**: Initially, `i` is set to `n`. However, the loop starts with `i` being 1. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to start at 1.
- **Variable `n`**: Since `i` will iterate from 1 to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

The other variables (`maxi`, `res`, `arr`, and `mini`) are not part of the loop head and their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`maxi` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `res` is updated based on the loop body, `arr` is updated based on the loop body, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`**
