Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `maxi` is the maximum value in the permutation `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, and `mini` is the minimum value in the same permutation.**

After all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `maxi` will hold the maximum value from the permutation `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`.
- `mini` will hold the minimum value from the same permutation.
- The variable `n` will be the size of the permutation, which is `n`.
- The variable `arr` will contain all indices from `0` to `n-1` in some order, but it is not directly used in the final output.
- The variable `i` will be `n` after the loop completes.
- The variable `res` will be the result of the last comparison, either `'<'` or `'='`, but it is not used in the final output.

In summary, the loop processes the permutation to find its maximum and minimum values, and these values are printed as the final output.
