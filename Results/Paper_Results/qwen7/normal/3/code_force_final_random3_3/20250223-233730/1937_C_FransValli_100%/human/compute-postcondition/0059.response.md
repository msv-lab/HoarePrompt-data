Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` must have at least 2 elements.
- `item` is `arr[1]`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

Here, `mini` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information. Therefore, `mini` will be treated as an undefined variable in the context of this print statement.

The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by `mini` twice, followed by `item` twice. Since `item` is `arr[1]`, the output will include `arr[1]` twice.

Given the format requirement, the output should be:

Output: **'? mini mini [arr[1]] [arr[1]]'**
