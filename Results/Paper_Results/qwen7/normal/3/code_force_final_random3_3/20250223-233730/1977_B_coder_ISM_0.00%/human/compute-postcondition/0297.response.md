Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, length)`. This means `i` must be less than `length`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `length` must be greater than 1
   - `s[i]` is '0'

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `length` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` is now 2).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `length` must be greater than 2.

6. **Consider the postcondition**: The postcondition does not affect the loop continuation directly but provides context about the string `s`. However, it does not change the loop continuation condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `length` must be greater than 2**.
