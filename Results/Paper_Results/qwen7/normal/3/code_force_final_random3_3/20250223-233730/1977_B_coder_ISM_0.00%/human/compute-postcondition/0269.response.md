Output State: **`i` is 2, `flag` is a boolean, `s` is a string such that the character at index 2 of `s` is '1'**.

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '1'` changes the character at index `i` (which is 2) in the string `s` to '1'. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `flag` remains a boolean, and the character at index 2 of `s` is now '1'.
