Output State: **`i` is 0, `flag` remains unchanged, `s[i]` is '-1', and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `s[i]` from '1' to '-1'. Since `i` is 0, `s[0]` is now '-1'. The value of `flag` remains unchanged, and `s[i]` (which is now '-1') is still equal to `s[i + 1]` because `i + 1` would be 1, and `s[1]` was previously equal to `s[0]` which is now '-1'.
