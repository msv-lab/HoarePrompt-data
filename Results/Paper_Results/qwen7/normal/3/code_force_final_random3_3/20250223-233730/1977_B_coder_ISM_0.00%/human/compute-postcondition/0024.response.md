Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `x` is an input integer.
- `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0'. The value of each element in `s` depends on the corresponding bit in `x`.

The print statement `print(*s)` will unpack the list `s` and print each element separated by a space.

To determine the exact output, we need to know the binary representation of `x`. Since `s` contains '1' or '0' based on the bits of `x`, the output will be a sequence of 30 '1's and '0's representing the binary form of `x`.

However, without the specific value of `x`, we cannot provide the exact sequence of '1's and '0's. Therefore, the output will be a sequence of 30 characters, each being either '1' or '0', depending on the bits of `x`.

Output: **a sequence of 30 characters, each being either '1' or '0', depending on the bits of x**
