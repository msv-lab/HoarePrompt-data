Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(30):` statement. The only variable that changes within this loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `length` is 30 (this does not change within the loop)
   - `nalla` is 33 (this does not change within the loop)
   - `x` is an input integer (this does not change within the loop)
   - `s` is either `['1', '1']` if `x & pow(2, i)` is greater than 0, or `['0', '0']` otherwise.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The values of `length`, `nalla`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Based on these observations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 33, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is either `['1', '1']` if `x & pow(2, i)` is greater than 0, or `['0', '0']` otherwise.**
