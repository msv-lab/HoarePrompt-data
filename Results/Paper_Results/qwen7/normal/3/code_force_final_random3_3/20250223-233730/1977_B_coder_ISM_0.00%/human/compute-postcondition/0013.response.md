Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < 30`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a list.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < 30`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 30.

Given that the loop just finished its previous iteration, `i` was equal to 29 (since it starts from 0 and goes up to 29). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 30.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list, `i` is 30**
