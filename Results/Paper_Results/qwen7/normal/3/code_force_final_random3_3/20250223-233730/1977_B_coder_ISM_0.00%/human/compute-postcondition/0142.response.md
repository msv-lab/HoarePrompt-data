Output State: **`i` is 0, `flag` is 1, `s[i]` is '-1', and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code sets the variable `flag` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 0, `flag` is now 1, `s[i]` is still '-1', and `s[i]` is still equal to `s[i + 1]`.
