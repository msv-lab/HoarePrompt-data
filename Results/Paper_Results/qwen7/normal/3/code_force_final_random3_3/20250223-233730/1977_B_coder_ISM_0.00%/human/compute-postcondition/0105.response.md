Output State: `i` is 29, `length` is at least 29, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[0]` is '-1', `s[1]` is '1', for all `i` from 2 to 28, `s[i]` remains '0', `s[29]` is '0', and `s[30]` is '1'.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `length - 1`, which is 29 in this case. The loop continues to check the condition `(s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1')`. Since the initial state had `s[28]` as '0' and `s[29]` as '1', and subsequent iterations do not change `s[28]` to '-1' or make any further changes to `s[29]` being '1', the condition will never be met again once `i` reaches 28. Therefore, the loop terminates when `i` is 29. All other variables remain in their final states as described.
