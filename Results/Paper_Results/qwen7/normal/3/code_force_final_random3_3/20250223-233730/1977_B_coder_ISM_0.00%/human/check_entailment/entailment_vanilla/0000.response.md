Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program constructs a binary representation of `x` using a list `s` where each element is either `'1'` or `'0'`.
   - This is done by iterating over bits from `2^0` to `2^29` and checking if the corresponding bit in `x` is set.
   - This part is correct and ensures that the sum of the constructed array equals `x`.

3. **Modifying the Binary Representation:**
   - The program aims to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist in the array.
   - It iterates over the list `s` and modifies elements based on certain conditions:
     - If a zero follows a one (`s[i] == '0'` and `s[i+1] == '1'`), it changes the zero to `-1`.
     - If a one is followed by another one (`s[i] == '1'` and `s[i+1] == '1'`), it changes the second one to `0`.
     - If a zero is followed by a one and the previous element was already modified to `-1`, it changes the current zero to `0`.
   - These modifications ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If the last element is `0` and needs to be changed to `1` to satisfy the conditions, it appends `1` to the list and increments the length.
   - This ensures that the final array meets the required conditions.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself.

### Verification

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, let's verify if the program meets the requirements:

- **Binary Representation:** Correctly constructs the binary representation of `x`.
- **Modification Logic:** Ensures no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
- **Edge Cases:** Handles edge cases correctly by appending `1` if necessary.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate an array that satisfies the given conditions.

**Correctness: **True**
