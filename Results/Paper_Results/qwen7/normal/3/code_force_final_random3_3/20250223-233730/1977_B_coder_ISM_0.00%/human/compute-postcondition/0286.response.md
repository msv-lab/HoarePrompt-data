Output State: **`i` is 28, `flag` is 1, and the string `s` now has its 30th character (s[29]) set to '1'.**

The code `s.append('1')` adds the character '1' to the end of the string `s`. Initially, the 30th character of `s` was '0', so after appending '1', the 30th character becomes '1'. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged.
