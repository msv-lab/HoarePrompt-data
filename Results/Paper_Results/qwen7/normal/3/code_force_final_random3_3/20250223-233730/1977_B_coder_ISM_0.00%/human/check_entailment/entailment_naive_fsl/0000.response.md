Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate an array that satisfies the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that there does not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\).

Consider the test case \(x = 14\). The program generates the output:
```
5
0 -1 0 0 1
```
This output is correct as it satisfies the sum condition and the constraint on consecutive non-zero elements. However, consider another test case \(x = 18\). The program generates the output:
```
5
0 0 0 1 1
```
This output is incorrect because it violates the constraint that there should not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). Here, \(a_3 = 1\) and \(a_4 = 1\), which violates the constraint.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
