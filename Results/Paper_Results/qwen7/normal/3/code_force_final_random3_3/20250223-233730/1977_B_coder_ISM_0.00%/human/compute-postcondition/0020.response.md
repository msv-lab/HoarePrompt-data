Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with '1', '0' appended to it, and `i` is 30**.

Explanation: The code `s.append('0')` appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` contains either `'1'` or `'0'`. After appending `'0'`, `s` will contain both `'1'` and `'0'`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
