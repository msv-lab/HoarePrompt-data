Output State: The variable `i` will be 29, `length` will remain 30, `nalla` will still be 33, `x` will remain as the input integer, and `s` will be a list of 30 elements. Each element in `s` will be '1' if the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` (considering the least significant bit as the first position) is set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is greater than 0), and '0' if the corresponding bit is not set.
