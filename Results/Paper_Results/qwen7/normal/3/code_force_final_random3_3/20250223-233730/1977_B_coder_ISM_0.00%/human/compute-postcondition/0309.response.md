Given the initial state where `i` is 30 and `flag` is 1, and considering the `print(*s)` statement, we need to determine the content of the string `s`.

However, the problem does not provide any information about how the string `s` is modified. Without this information, we cannot determine the exact content of `s`. Therefore, we can only describe the general form of the output based on the available information.

Since `s` is a string and the `*` operator is used with `print`, it implies that `s` is expected to be a sequence (like a tuple or a list) of strings, and the `print` function will print each element of the sequence on a new line.

Output: **s (where s is a sequence of strings)**
