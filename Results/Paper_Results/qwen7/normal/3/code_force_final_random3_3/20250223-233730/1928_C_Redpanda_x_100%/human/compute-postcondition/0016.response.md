Output State: **After all iterations, `prime_to_i` will be equal to the original value multiplied by `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime]`, and `factors[prime]` will be set to 0.**

This means that `prime_to_i` will hold the value of the original `prime_to_i` (which starts as 1) multiplied by `prime` repeated `factors[prime]` times. Once the loop finishes, `factors[prime]` will be reduced to 0 since the loop runs exactly `factors[prime] + 1` times and then stops.
