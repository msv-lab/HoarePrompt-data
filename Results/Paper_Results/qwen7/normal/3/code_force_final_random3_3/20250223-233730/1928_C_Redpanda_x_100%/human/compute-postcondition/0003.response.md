Output State: **`k` is an integer, `primes` is a list of integers, the length of `primes` is not equal to `k`, `rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`**.

This means that the function `generate(k + 1)` has been called with the argument `k + 1`, and the return value of this function call has been assigned to the variable `rest`. The values of `k` and `primes` remain unchanged from their initial states.
