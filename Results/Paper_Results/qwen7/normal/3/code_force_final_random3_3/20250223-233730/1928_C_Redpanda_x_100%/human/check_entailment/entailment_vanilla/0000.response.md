Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya during the settling can be consistent with the described pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern is periodic with period \( 2k - 2 \).
   - The value of \( x \) must be within the range of the first \( k \) numbers in one period of the settling pattern.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided includes two functions `func_1` and `generate`, but neither function seems to directly solve the problem at hand.
   - `func_1` attempts to find all factors of a number \( n \), but it doesn't use the result in any meaningful way for solving the problem.
   - `generate` is a recursive generator that generates all possible products of prime factors, but it doesn't seem to be used in the context of the problem.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to determine the range of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) can be part of the settling pattern.
   - Specifically, \( k \) must satisfy the condition that the position \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) should give a valid \( x \) within the range \( 1 \) to \( k \).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the range of \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq x \leq k \) and \( n \mod (2k - 2) \) gives a valid \( x \).
   - This involves solving inequalities and checking the conditions.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `generate` do not contribute to solving the problem as stated.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
