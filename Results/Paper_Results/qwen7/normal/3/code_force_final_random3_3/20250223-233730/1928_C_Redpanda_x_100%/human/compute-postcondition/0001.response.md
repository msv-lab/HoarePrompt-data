Output State: **`k` is equal to the length of the list `primes`, and 1 is yielded.**

Explanation: The code `yield 1` does not change the value of `k` or `primes`. It simply yields the value `1`. Since the initial state of `k` is defined as the length of the list `primes`, and no changes are made to `k` or `primes` within the given code snippet, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that `1` is yielded.
