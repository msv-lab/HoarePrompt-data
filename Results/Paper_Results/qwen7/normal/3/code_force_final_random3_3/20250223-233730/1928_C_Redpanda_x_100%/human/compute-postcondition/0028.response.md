Output State: `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `factors[prime]` is equal to -1 (indicating that the factor `prime` has been fully processed), `factor` is the next element in `rest`, and `rest` contains the remaining elements after removing the current `factor`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `prime_to_i` will be updated to `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`. The `factors[prime]` will be set to -1, indicating that the prime factorization process for `prime` has completed. The `factor` and `rest` will retain their state from the last iteration of the loop, ready for the next prime factor to be processed.
