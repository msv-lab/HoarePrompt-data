Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile; `winNext` is the return value of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_2` with two arguments: `a[1:]`, which is the list `a` excluding its first element, and `n - 1`, which is the value of `n` decremented by 1. The result of this function call is assigned to the variable `winNext`. The initial list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged.
