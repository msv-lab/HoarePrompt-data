Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem describes a game where players take turns removing a certain number of stones from each non-empty pile simultaneously, with the player who cannot make a move losing. We need to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of stones in the piles.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` processes the list `a` by sorting it and then computing differences between consecutive elements.
   - This transformation helps in simplifying the game state by focusing on the relative sizes of the piles rather than their absolute values.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` uses a recursive approach to determine the winner based on the transformed list `a` and the number of piles `n`.
   - For small cases (`n == 1` or `n == 2`), it directly returns the winner based on simple conditions.
   - For larger cases, it recursively checks the next player's winning condition and adjusts based on the current pile's size.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It calls `func_1` to transform the input list `a`.
   - It then calls `func_2` to determine the winner based on the transformed list and the number of piles.
   - Finally, it prints the winner for each test case.

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly transforms the input list to focus on relative sizes.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles base cases and recursively determines the winner based on the game rules.
   - The overall structure of the program matches the problem requirements.

Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
