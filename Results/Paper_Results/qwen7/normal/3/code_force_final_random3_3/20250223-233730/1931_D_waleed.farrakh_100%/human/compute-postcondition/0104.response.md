Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `current_pair` is `((-a % x + x) % x, a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a % y` to `ry`. Since `ry` was previously defined as `a % y`, it now explicitly holds the value of `a % y`. All other variables (`arr`, `current_pair`, `rx`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
