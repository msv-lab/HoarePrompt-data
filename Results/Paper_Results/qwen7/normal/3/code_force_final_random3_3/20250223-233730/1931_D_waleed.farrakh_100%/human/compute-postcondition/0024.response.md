Given the initial state that `results` must contain at least one element, we know that `results` is a non-empty list. However, the specific value of the element in `results` is not provided.

The print statement `print(result)` will print the first element of the `results` list because the variable `result` is used without specifying an index, and by default, it refers to the first element of the list if no index is specified.

Output: **the first element of results**
