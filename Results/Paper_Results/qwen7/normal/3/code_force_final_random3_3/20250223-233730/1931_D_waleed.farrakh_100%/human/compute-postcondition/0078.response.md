Output State: **`arr` contains all elements except the current `a`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `count` is incremented by `freq[(a % x, a % y)]`, and `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The line `freq[current_pair] = 1` sets the value of `freq[current_pair]` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
