You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. arr is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        
        idx += 2
        
    #State: Output State: `idx` is equal to `t * 2`, `t` is equal to 0, `data` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is a list containing tuples `(n, x, y, arr)` for each iteration of the loop, where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the split data, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `idx` will be twice the original value of `t`, `t` will be reduced to 0 (since it decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0), `data` will remain unchanged, and `test_cases` will contain a tuple for each iteration of the loop, with each tuple consisting of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `results` contains at least one element. Once `results` no longer contains any elements, the loop will terminate.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter t, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, it accepts three integers n, x, and y, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. Additionally, it accepts a list arr of n integers, where each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the specified conditions and operations.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
