Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be explicitly adjusted.
   - `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer.
   - `t` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Consider the other given states**:
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `test_cases` is an empty list.
   - `idx` is 1 (though this is not directly relevant to the loop's execution).

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

So, the final answer is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
