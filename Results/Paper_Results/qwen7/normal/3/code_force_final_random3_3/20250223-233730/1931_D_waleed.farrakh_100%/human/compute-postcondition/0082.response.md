Output State: **`results` now contains the value of `count`, all other variables (`current_pair`, `rx`, `ry`, `count`, and `freq`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`. No other changes are made to the variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, `current_pair`, `rx`, `ry`, `count`, and `freq` remain in their original states, while `results` now includes the updated count.
