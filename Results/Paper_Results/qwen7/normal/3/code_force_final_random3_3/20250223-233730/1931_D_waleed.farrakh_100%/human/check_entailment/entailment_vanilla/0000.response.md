Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\).
   - The conditions for a pair to be considered "beautiful" are:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For the pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful, the following must hold:
     - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)
     - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\)

3. **Simplifying the Conditions:**
   - From the above conditions, we get:
     - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x} \Rightarrow a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}\)
     - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y} \Rightarrow a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\)

   - Combining these, we need:
     - \(a_j \equiv -a_i \pmod{x}\) and \(a_j \equiv a_i \pmod{y}\)

4. **Approach in the Code:**
   - The code uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of the remainders when elements are divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - For each element \(a_i\), it calculates the remainders \((-a_i \mod x + x) \% x\) and \(a_i \mod y\).
   - It checks if this pair of remainders exists in the frequency dictionary and updates the count accordingly.
   - It also updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair of remainders.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs.
   - The `func_2` function reads the input correctly and processes each test case using `func_1`.

### Detailed Verification

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The logic for counting beautiful pairs is sound.
  - The use of modulo operations to handle negative values is correct.
  - The frequency dictionary is updated and queried correctly.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The input reading and splitting into test cases is done correctly.
  - Each test case is processed using `func_1` and the results are printed correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**
