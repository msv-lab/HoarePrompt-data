Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x; `ry` is a % y**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a % y` to `ry`. The value of `rx` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The precondition that `arr` must contain at least one element is still valid.
