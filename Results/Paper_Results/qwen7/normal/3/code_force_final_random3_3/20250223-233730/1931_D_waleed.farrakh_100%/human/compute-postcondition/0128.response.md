Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list `arr`. For each tuple, it computes the count of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` in the list `arr` and accumulates these counts. After processing all tuples, it returns a list of these accumulated counts along with the final states of the frequency dictionary `freq`, and the variables `rx`, `ry`, and `current_pair` from the last iteration.**
