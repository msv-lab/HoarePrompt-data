Output State: **All elements in `arr` have been processed, `rx` and `ry` are calculated for each element `a` in `arr`, `count` is the sum of frequencies of all unique pairs `(a % x, a % y)` found in `freq`, and `freq` contains the frequency of each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` encountered in `arr`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, every element in `arr` has been processed once. For each element `a` in `arr`, `rx` is computed as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is computed as `a % y`. The variable `count` accumulates the total frequency of all unique pairs `(a % x, a % y)` found in the `freq` dictionary. Additionally, the dictionary `freq` keeps track of how many times each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` appears in `arr`.
