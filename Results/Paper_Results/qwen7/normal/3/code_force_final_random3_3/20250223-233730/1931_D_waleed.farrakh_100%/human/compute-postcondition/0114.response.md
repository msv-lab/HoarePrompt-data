Output State: **`arr` contains at least one element, `count` is increased by `freq[(a % x, a % y)]`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, and `freq[(a % x, a % y)]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rx` to `(-a % x + x) % x`. This operation ensures that `rx` is always a non-negative number less than `x`. The other variables (`arr`, `count`, `current_pair`, `ry`, and `freq[(a % x, a % y)]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
