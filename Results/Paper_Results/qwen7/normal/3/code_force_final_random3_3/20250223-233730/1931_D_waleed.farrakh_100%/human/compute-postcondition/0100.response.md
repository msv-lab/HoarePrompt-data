Postcondition: `arr` must contain at least one element; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `count` is increased by 1 if `current_pair` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged; `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1 if `current_pair` is already in `freq`, otherwise `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, and `(rx, ry)` is not in `freq`.
