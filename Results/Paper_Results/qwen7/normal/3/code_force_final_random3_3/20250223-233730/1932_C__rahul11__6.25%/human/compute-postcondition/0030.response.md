Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for k in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `k` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   The loop will continue as long as `k < n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `n - 1`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `k` starts from 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `k` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`k` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l or r] % MOD` depending on whether `s[k]` is 'L' or not, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is increased by 1 if `s[k]` is 'L', and `r` is decreased by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', `c` is increased by 1**
