Reasoning:

1. The annotated program initializes the necessary variables and reads the input as specified.
2. It calculates the initial product of the array `arr` and stores it in `ans`.
3. The program then iterates through the string `s` and processes each command ('L' or 'R') as per the problem statement.
   - For each 'L' command, it divides `ans` by the leftmost element of `arr` and updates `l` to point to the next element.
   - For each 'R' command, it divides `ans` by the rightmost element of `arr` and updates `r` to point to the previous element.
4. After processing each command, it stores the updated value of `ans` in the `res` list.
5. Finally, it prints the results stored in `res`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly processes each command and updates the product accordingly. The use of modular arithmetic (`% MOD`) ensures that the intermediate results do not overflow, which is important given the large size of the numbers involved.

Therefore, the program logic matches the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
