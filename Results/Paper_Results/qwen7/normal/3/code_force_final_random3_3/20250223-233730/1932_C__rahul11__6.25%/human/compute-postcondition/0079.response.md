Output State: **`res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is the value of `ans` after performing the operation `ans = ans // arr[r-1] % MOD`, `k` is an index within the string `s`, and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not 'L'.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `ans` is now `ans = ans // arr[r-1] % MOD`, and `res[c]` remains equal to `ans % m % MOD`. The character at index `k` in string `s` still is not 'L'.
