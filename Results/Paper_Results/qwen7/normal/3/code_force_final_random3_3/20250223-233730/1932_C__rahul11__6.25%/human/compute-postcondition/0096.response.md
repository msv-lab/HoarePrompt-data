Output State: **`c` is 2, `ans` is the integer value of `ans` divided by `arr[l]` modulo `MOD`, `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `n-1`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged**

Explanation: The code `res[c] = ans % m % MOD` updates the value of `res[c]` to be the result of `ans % m % MOD`. The other variables (`c`, `ans`, `k`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
