Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for k in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved here are `k` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will start with `k = 0` and continue until `k < n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `n - 1` should be at least 1).

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `k` will start at 0, but we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.
   - The other variables (`ans`, `s`, `res`, `l`, `r`, `c`, and `res[0]`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` being greater than 1.

**State:**
**`n` must be greater than 1**
