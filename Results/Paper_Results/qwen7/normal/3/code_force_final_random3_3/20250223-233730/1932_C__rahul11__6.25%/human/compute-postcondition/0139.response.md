Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is an integer, `k` is `k + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.**

This means that the value of `ans` is updated to `ans` divided by `arr[r]` (integer division) and then taken modulo `MOD`. The other variables retain their previous states.
