Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `k + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[c]` to be `ans % m % MOD`. The values of `c`, `ans`, `res[c]`, `k`, and the condition on `n` are updated as described. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
