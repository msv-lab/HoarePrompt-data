Output State: **`res[0]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is equal to the product of all elements in `arr`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

The code `r = n - 1` assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `r`. The other variables (`res[0]`, `ans`, `c`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
