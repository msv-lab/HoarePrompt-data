Postcondition: `ans` and `res[c]` are integers. If the character at index `k` in the string `s` is 'L', then `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, and `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, where `l` is increased by 1. If the character at index `k` in the string `s` is not 'L', then `res[c]` remains as `ans % m % MOD`, and `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r-1] % MOD`.
