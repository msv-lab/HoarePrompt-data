Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[s[k]] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `k + 1`, `l` is increased by 1 if `s[k] == 'L'`, otherwise `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `c += 1` increases the value of `c` by 1. The other conditions related to `ans`, `res`, `k`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their postconditions, as no operations affecting these variables are performed in the given code snippet.
