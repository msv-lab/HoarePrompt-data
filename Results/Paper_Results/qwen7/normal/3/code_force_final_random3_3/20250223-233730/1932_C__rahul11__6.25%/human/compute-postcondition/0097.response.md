Output State: **`c` is 2, `l` is incremented by 1, `ans` is the integer value of `ans` divided by `arr[l]` modulo `MOD`, `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `n-1`, `r` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1. The values of `c`, `ans`, `res[c]`, `k`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `l` is used in the calculation of `ans` and `res[c]`.
