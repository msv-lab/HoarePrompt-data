Output State: **`ans` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is 1, `res` is a list of length `n` initialized to 0, `k` is the number of iterations left to process, `s` is a list of characters obtained from input.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 1` initializes the variable `ans` to the integer value 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
