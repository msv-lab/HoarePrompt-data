Output State: **`c` is 2, `ans` is the integer value of `ans` divided by `arr[l]` modulo `MOD`, `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `n-1`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by performing integer division by `arr[l]` and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The other variables (`c`, `res[c]`, `k`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
