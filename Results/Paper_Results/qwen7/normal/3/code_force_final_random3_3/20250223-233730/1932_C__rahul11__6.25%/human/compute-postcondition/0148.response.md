Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `k + 1`, `l` is increased by 1, `k` is `k + 1`, `l` is increased by 1 if `s[k] == 'L'`, otherwise `r` is decreased by 1, and the value of `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `c` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `k + 1`, and `l` is increased by 1. The condition for `l` being increased by 1 if `s[k] == 'L'` or `r` being decreased by 1 if `s[k] != 'L'` also holds true.
