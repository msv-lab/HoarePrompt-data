Output State: **`ans` is the value of `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by performing integer division (`//`) of `ans` by `arr[l]` and then taking the modulus (`%`) with `MOD`. However, the initial values or expressions for `ans`, `arr[l]`, and `MOD` are not provided. Since the initial state does not give us these values, we can only say that `ans` has been updated according to the operation described. The values of `k` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
