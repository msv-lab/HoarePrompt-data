Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the first integer entered, `x` is the second integer entered, `y` is the third integer entered; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the original list of strings.**

The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` was initially greater than 0, after the decrement, `t` is now greater than 1. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
