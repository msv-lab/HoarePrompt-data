Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads the chosen vertices and stores them in an array `arr`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Triangles**:
   - The program prints `x - 2` for each test case.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
- **Constraints**:
  - `n` (number of sides) is between 4 and \(10^9\).
  - `x` (number of chosen vertices) is between 2 and \(\min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)\).
  - `y` (maximum additional vertices) is 0 in this version.
- **Output**: Maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces.

### Key Points to Consider
- **Number of Triangles**:
  - For a polygon with `n` sides, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using any set of vertices is `n - 2`.
  - However, the program is only considering the number of chosen vertices `x` and printing `x - 2`.

### Issues Identified
- **Incorrect Calculation**:
  - The program calculates `x - 2` instead of `n - 2`. This means it is not considering the total number of sides of the polygon, but rather just the number of chosen vertices.
  - For example, if `n = 8` and `x = 4`, the correct answer should be `8 - 2 = 6` (since we can form up to 6 triangles), but the program outputs `4 - 2 = 2`.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect because it does not account for the total number of sides `n` of the polygon, but only the number of chosen vertices `x`. Therefore, the logic to calculate the maximum number of triangles is flawed.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
