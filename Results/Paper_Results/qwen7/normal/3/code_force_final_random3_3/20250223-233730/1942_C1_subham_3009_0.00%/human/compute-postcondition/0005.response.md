Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 9999, inclusive; `n` is the first integer entered, `x` is the second integer entered, `y` is the third integer entered; `arr` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

The code `arr = input().split()` takes the input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The new variable `arr` is created and assigned the list of strings resulting from the split operation.
