Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), inclusive.
3. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is already within the range of 1 to \(10^4\), it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to make the loop execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), inclusive**
