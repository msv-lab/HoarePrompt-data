Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split.
- `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split.
- `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the input split into integers.

The `print(x - 2)` statement will print the value of `x` minus 2.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the input split. The value of `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the integer value of the second element of the input split)**
