Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is now greater than 0 - 1, which means `t` is greater than -1. Since `t` is a boolean expression, it simplifies to `t` being `True`.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split.
- `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split.
- `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the input split into integers.

The print statement is `print(x - 2)`. Here, `x` is an integer value derived from the second element of the input split.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `x` minus 2.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the integer value of the second element of the input split)**
