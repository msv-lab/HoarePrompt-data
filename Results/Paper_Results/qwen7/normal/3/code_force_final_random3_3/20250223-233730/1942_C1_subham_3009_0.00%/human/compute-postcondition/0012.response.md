Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `arr` by converting the first `x` elements of the input split into integers. The original values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `arr` (which now contains the converted integers) are preserved.
