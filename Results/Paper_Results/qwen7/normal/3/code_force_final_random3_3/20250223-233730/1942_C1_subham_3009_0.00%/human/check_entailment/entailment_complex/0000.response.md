Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.
2. For a polygon with \( n \) sides, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is \( n - 2 \). This is a well-known geometric property.
3. Given that Bessie has already chosen \( x \) vertices, the remaining vertices that can be chosen are limited by \( y = 0 \). Thus, no additional vertices can be chosen.
4. The provided code correctly prints \( x - 2 \) for each test case, which is the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices without adding any new ones.

Given the above points, the code logic matches the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
