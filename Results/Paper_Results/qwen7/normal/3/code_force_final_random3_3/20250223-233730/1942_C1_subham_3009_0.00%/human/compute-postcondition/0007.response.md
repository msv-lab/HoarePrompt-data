Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 0 and 9999, inclusive.
- `n` is the first integer entered.
- `x` is the second integer entered.
- `y` is the third integer entered.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the original list of strings.

The print statement is `print(x - 2)`. 

Since `x` is the second integer entered, it is a specific integer value. The expression `x - 2` will subtract 2 from this integer value.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `x` minus 2.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second integer entered)**
