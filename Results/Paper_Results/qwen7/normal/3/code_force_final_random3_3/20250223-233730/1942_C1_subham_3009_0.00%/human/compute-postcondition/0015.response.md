Output State: **`t` is now greater than 0 - 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, making it `t - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
