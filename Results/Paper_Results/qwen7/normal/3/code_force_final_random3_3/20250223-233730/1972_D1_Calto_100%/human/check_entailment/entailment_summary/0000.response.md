Reasoning:
The given solution does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, this function is not used in the main logic of the program, so it is irrelevant to our correctness check.

2. **Function `func_2`**: The provided code for `func_2` does not match the problem statement. Specifically, it does not correctly count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

   - The loop in `func_2` iterates over values of `i` from 1 to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
   - It then increments `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

This approach is incorrect because:
- The variables `x` and `y` do not represent any meaningful values related to the problem constraints.
- The logic inside the loop does not correctly count the valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given condition.

Given the mismatch between the implementation and the problem requirements, we can conclude that the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
