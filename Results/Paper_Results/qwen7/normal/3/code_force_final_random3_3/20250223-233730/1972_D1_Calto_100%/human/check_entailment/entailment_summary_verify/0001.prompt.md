You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6) and returns the integer `cnt`, which is calculated based on a series of operations within a loop. After the loop completes, `cnt` is set to 8, `i` is 5, `m` is at least 3, `x` is -21, and `y` is 25.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **GCD Calculation Function (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The logic is correct and will work as expected.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not match the problem statement. Specifically:
     - The logic inside the loop does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
     - The variables `x` and `y` are not used in the context of the problem.
     - The formula `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is not relevant to the problem.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is the corrected version of the main function:

```python
from math import gcd

def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Testing with Provided Examples

Let's test the corrected function with the provided examples:

```python
# Test cases
test_cases = [
    (1, 1),
    (2, 3),
    (3, 5),
    (10, 8),
    (100, 1233),
    (1000000, 1145141)
]

# Expected results
expected_results = [1, 3, 4, 14, 153, 1643498]

# Check the function against the test cases
for n, m in test_cases:
    result = func_2(n, m)
    assert result == expected_results[test_cases.index((n, m))], f"Failed for {n} {m}"
print("All test cases passed.")
```

If the function passes all these tests, it is correct.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis and the need for a corrected approach, the initial implementation is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
