### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Function 1 Analysis:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. This is a standard and correct implementation.

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

#### Function 2 Analysis:
The function `func_2` is where the issue lies. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: `cnt` is initialized to -1.
2. **Loop through possible values of \(b\)**: The loop iterates from 1 to \(m\).
3. **Calculations inside the loop**:
   - \(x = n - (i * i - i)\)
   - \(y = i * i\)
   - `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`

Let's analyze these calculations:

- \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) simplifies to \(x = n - i(i - 1)\)
- \(y = i * i\)

The expression `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is intended to count how many times \(x\) is divisible by \(y\). However, this approach does not align with the problem requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is the corrected approach:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

This approach iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly.

#### Corrected Function 2:
```python
def func_2(n, m):
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a

    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

#### Testing the Corrected Function:
Let's test the corrected function with the provided example:

```python
print(func_2(2, 3))  # Expected output: 3
```

This will correctly output 3, as the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\).

Given the analysis, the original function `func_2` is indeed incorrect. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the `func_2` function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
