### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Function `func_1`
This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This is essential for calculating \(\gcd(a, b)\) later in the program.

#### Function `func_2`
The function `func_2` is supposed to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. However, the provided implementation seems to be incorrect. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop iterates over values of \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. **Calculations**:
   - \(x = n - (i * i - i)\)
   - \(y = i * i\)
   - `cnt` is updated using `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`

These calculations do not align with the problem requirements. Specifically:
- \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) is not directly related to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- \(y = i * i\) is simply the square of \(i\), which is not relevant to the problem.

Given these observations, let's re-evaluate the annotated code and the expected behavior:

- **Annotated Code Analysis**:
  - The annotated code suggests that the loop runs for \(i\) from 1 to \(m\), but it does not explain how these values relate to the problem constraints.
  - The values of `x` and `y` are calculated in a way that does not match the problem statement.
  - The final value of `cnt` is 8, which is not consistent with the expected output for the given test case \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\).

- **Test Case Verification**:
  - For \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\):
    - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 1)\)
    - Expected output: 3
  - Running the provided code with \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\) will not produce the correct result, as indicated in the original assessment.

Based on the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the `func_2` function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
