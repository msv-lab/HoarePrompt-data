Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - The logic is correct and the state transitions are accurate.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem. It uses a formula that does not match the given conditions.
   - Specifically, the formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not relate to the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The logic inside the loop and the way `cnt` is updated do not align with the problem's requirements.

Given the provided example and the expected output, the function `func_2` seems to have a fundamental flaw in its approach. Let's analyze the correct solution:

To solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if they satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here is a corrected version of `func_2`:

```python
from math import gcd

def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

With this corrected function, let's re-evaluate the annotated program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)
```

Given the corrected function, the annotated program now correctly calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

Correctness: **False**

The original `func_2` is incorrect and does not solve the problem as intended. The corrected version should be used instead.
