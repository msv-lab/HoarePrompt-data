Output State: **`cnt` is 5, `i` is 4, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is `-8`, `y` is 16**

Explanation: The code `y = i * i` squares the value of `i` (which is 4) and assigns the result to `y`. So, `y` becomes 16. The values of `cnt`, `i`, `m`, `x`, and `y` are updated accordingly, while the conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
