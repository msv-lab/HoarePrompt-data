Output State: `cnt` is 7, `i` is 5, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is -21, `y` is 25.

Explanation: The loop continues until `i` exceeds `m`. From the given information, we can see that after 3 iterations, `i` is 4 and `m` must be at least 3. For the loop to complete all its iterations, `m` must be at least 4. After 4 iterations, `i` would be 5. We can calculate the values of `x` and `y` for `i = 5` as follows:
- \( y = i^2 = 5^2 = 25 \)
- \( x = n - (i * i - i) = n - (25 - 5) = n - 20 \)

The value of `cnt` after 4 iterations would be:
- Initial `cnt` is -1.
- After 1st iteration, `cnt` becomes 2.
- After 2nd iteration, `cnt` becomes 5.
- After 3rd iteration, `cnt` becomes 8 - 1 = 7 (since `cnt` is updated in each iteration).

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `cnt` is 7, `i` is 5, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is `n - 20`, and `y` is 25.
