Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the value obtained from `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the value obtained from `int(input())`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000
   - `y` is `x // 2`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the value obtained from `int(input())`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the value obtained from `int(input())` must be greater than 1.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 2.
   - The value obtained from `int(input())` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `y` is `x // 2`, and the value obtained from `int(input())` must be greater than 1**.
