Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as the input integer (greater than 1) is provided. After all iterations, the final value of `i` will be the total number of iterations minus one, `x` will be the last input integer between 1 and 1000, and `y` will be `x // 2`.

In more detail, if the loop runs `n` times, then `i` will be `n-1`, `x` will be the last input integer within the specified range, and `y` will be half of `x`.
