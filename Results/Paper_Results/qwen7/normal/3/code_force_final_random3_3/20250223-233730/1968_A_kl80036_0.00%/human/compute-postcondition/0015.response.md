Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where the number of test cases \( t \) is provided first, followed by \( t \) integers \( x \) (each between 2 and 1000 inclusive). For each \( x \), it calculates \( y \) as \( x \) divided by 2 using integer division and prints \( y \). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results of the calculations.**
