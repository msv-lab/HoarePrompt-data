Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (new value), `y` is `x // 2`, and the value obtained from `int(input())` is greater than 1 (new value)**.

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer (which must be between 1 and 1000 and greater than 1) to the variable `x`. The variable `y` is recalculated as `x // 2` because `y` is defined as `x // 2`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged.
