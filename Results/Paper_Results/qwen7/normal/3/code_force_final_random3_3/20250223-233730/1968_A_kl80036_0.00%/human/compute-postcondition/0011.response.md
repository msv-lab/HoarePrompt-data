Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `i` is 2.
2. `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
3. `y` is calculated as `x // 2`, which means `y` is the integer division of `x` by 2.
4. The value obtained from `int(input())` is greater than 1. This means that `x` must be an integer greater than 2 since `y = x // 2` and `y` must be an integer greater than 1.

Given that `y` is `x // 2` and `x` is an integer greater than 2, `y` will be an integer greater than 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `y`.

Output: **y (where y is the integer division of x by 2 and x is an integer greater than 2)**
