You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program:
from math import ceil
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

#Function 2:
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `make_array` takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It fills an array `arr` and another array `cliquess` within the specified range `[left, right]` with specific values. Specifically, it sets the first half of the range to values starting from `small_element` (which is `left + 1`) and incrementing by 1, and assigns the `clique` identifier to the corresponding indices in `cliquess`. The second half of the range is filled with values starting from `big_element` (which is `right + 1`) and decrementing by 1, also assigning the `clique` identifier to the corresponding indices in `cliquess`. The function does not return anything explicitly, but modifies the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays in place.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to handle the main logic of the problem.
   - It calculates the number of cliques needed using `ceil(n / k)` and initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` of size `n`.

2. **Initialization of Cliques**:
   - The function iterates over the range of `cliques`.
   - For each clique, it calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` for a specific range `[left, right]` and assigns all elements in this range to the same clique.
   - It calculates the middle point `mid` and divides the range into two parts.
   - Elements from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` are assigned to the current clique.
   - Elements from `big_element - not_mid` to `big_element - 1` are assigned to the current clique.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Distinct Values in `arr`**:
   - The `arr` array should contain distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The `make_array` function ensures that the elements in the range `[left, right]` are filled with consecutive integers starting from `small_element` and ending at `big_element`.
   - Since `small_element` and `big_element` are calculated correctly, and the ranges are properly divided, `arr` will contain distinct integers.

2. **Clique Assignment**:
   - The `cliquess` array assigns the same clique number to all elements within the range `[left, right]`.
   - This ensures that all elements in the same range belong to the same clique, and different ranges belong to different cliques.

3. **Graph Construction**:
   - The condition for adding an edge between vertices `(i, j)` is `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   - Given the way `arr` is constructed, for any two elements in the same clique, the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` will hold true because they are consecutive or near-consecutive integers.

4. **Partition into Minimum Clique Number**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is the minimum possible number of cliques required to satisfy the condition for the given `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate a valid assignment of integers to vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques. Therefore, the given program is correct.
