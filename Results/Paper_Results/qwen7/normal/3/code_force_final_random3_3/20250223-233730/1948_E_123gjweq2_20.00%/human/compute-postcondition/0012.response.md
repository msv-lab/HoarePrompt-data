Output State: **`mid` must be greater than 0; `cliquess[left + 1]` is equal to `clique`; `arr[left + 1]` is equal to `small_element + 1`; `arr[left + i]` is equal to `small_element + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is equal to `clique`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cliquess[left + i]` to be equal to `clique`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
