Output State: **`mid` must be greater than 0; `cliquess[left + 1]` is equal to `clique`; `arr[left + 1]` is equal to `small_element + 1`; `arr[left + i]` is equal to `small_element + i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + i]` to `small_element + i`. Since `i` is not defined in the snippet, it implies that `i` is a loop variable or an index that iterates from 0 to some upper limit. However, without a specific range for `i`, we can only say that for each `i`, the value of `arr[left + i]` is set to `small_element + i`. The conditions and values of `mid`, `cliquess[left + 1]`, and `arr[left + 1]` remain unchanged.
