Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `not_mid`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `not_mid`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `not_mid` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`.
   - `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - `not_mid` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `not_mid` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.

The updated state is:
State: **`not_mid` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2**
