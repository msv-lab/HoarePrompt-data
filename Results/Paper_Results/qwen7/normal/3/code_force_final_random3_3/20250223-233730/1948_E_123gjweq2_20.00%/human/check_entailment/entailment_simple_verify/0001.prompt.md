You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 40, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n, and the function `make_array` is defined elsewhere to fill the array `arr` based on the given parameters.

    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):

    #State: Output State: `cliques` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` will be `cliques`, `k` is used in the calculations but its exact value is not provided, resulting in the final call to `make_array((cliques-1) * k, min(cliques * k - 1, n - 1), cliques)`. The variable `arr` will be updated multiple times during the loop, and `cliquess` will also be updated, but their final values depend on the specific sequence of updates performed by the `make_array` function calls.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `cliques` will be the total number of iterations, `i` will match `cliques`, `k` will be used in the last `make_array` call but its exact value is unknown, and both `arr` and `cliquess` will have been updated according to the calls made within the loop.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: [elements of arr] (where the elements depend on the sequence of operations performed within the loop)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques (where cliques is the total number of iterations)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: the elements of the cliquess list after all iterations (where the exact values depend on the sequence of updates performed by the make_array function calls)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, and clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: All elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` in the array `arr` are set to values starting from `small_element` and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent element; `cliquess` at indices from `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to the value `clique`. The variable `mid` remains greater than 0 after the loop completes, indicating that there were enough elements to iterate over according to the initial conditions.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the array `arr` will have its elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` filled with values starting from `small_element` up to `small_element + mid - 1`, and the corresponding indices in the `cliquess` array will all be set to the `clique` identifier.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The array `arr` will have its elements from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` filled with values starting from `big_element - 1` down to `big_element - not_mid + 1`, and the corresponding indices in the `cliquess` array will all be set to the `clique` identifier.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the elements in `arr` from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will contain values ranging from `big_element - 1` to `big_element - not_mid + 1` in descending order. The `cliquess` array will have the value `clique` assigned to these same indices.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to handle the main logic of the problem.
   - It calculates the number of cliques needed using `ceil(n / k)` and initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` of size `n`.

2. **Initialization of Cliques**:
   - The function iterates over the range of `cliques`.
   - For each clique, it calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` for a specific range `[left, right]` and assigns all elements in this range to the same clique.
   - It calculates the middle point `mid` and divides the range into two parts.
   - Elements from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` are assigned to the current clique.
   - Elements from `big_element - not_mid` to `big_element - 1` are assigned to the current clique.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Distinct Values in `arr`**:
   - The `arr` array should contain distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The `make_array` function ensures that the elements in the range `[left, right]` are filled with consecutive integers starting from `small_element` and ending at `big_element`.
   - Since `small_element` and `big_element` are calculated correctly, and the ranges are properly divided, `arr` will contain distinct integers.

2. **Clique Assignment**:
   - The `cliquess` array assigns the same clique number to all elements within the range `[left, right]`.
   - This ensures that all elements in the same range belong to the same clique, and different ranges belong to different cliques.

3. **Graph Construction**:
   - The condition for adding an edge between vertices `(i, j)` is `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   - Given the way `arr` is constructed, for any two elements in the same clique, the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` will hold true because they are consecutive or near-consecutive integers.

4. **Partition into Minimum Clique Number**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is the minimum possible number of cliques required to satisfy the condition for the given `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate a valid assignment of integers to vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques. Therefore, the given program is correct.
