Output State: All elements from `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are set to values starting from `small_element` and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent element; `cliquess[left + i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, mid - 1]` is equal to `clique`. The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states after the loop has executed all iterations.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the array `arr` will have been updated such that it contains consecutive integers starting from `small_element` up to `small_element + mid - 1` at the positions from `left` to `left + mid - 1`. The corresponding elements in the `cliquess` array will all be set to the value of `clique`.
