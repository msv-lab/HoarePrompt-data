Output State: **`mid` must be greater than 0; `cliquess[left + i]` is equal to `clique`; `arr[left + i]` is equal to `small_element + i`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]`. This changes the value of `cliquess[left + i]` to `clique`. The other variables (`mid` and `arr[left + i]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
