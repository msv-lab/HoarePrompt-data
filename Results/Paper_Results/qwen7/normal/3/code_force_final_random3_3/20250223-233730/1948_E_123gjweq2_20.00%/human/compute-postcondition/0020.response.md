Output State: **`not_mid` must be greater than 0; `i` is 3; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`; `arr[left + mid + 2]` is `big_element - 2`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. Given that `i` was initially 2, after executing `i += 1`, `i` becomes 3. Therefore, `cliquess[left + mid + 3]` is now `clique`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
