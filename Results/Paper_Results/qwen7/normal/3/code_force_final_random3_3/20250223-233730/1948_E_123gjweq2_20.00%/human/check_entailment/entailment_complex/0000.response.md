Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to assign distinct integers to vertices of a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes an array `arr` and another array `cliquess` of size `n`.
   - It iterates through the number of cliques and calls `make_array` for each iteration.
   - `make_array` fills `arr` and `cliquess` in a specific pattern to ensure the conditions of the problem are met.

3. **Analyzing `make_array`**:
   - `make_array` fills `arr` and `cliquess` in a way that ensures the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for all pairs of vertices in the same clique.
   - It splits the range `[left, right]` into two halves and fills them with increasing and decreasing sequences respectively, ensuring the distance condition is met.

4. **Verification**:
   - The approach taken in `func_1` and `make_array` seems to correctly partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques by ensuring that the distance condition is met.
   - The use of `ceil(n / k)` to determine the number of cliques is appropriate because it ensures that each clique can cover as many vertices as possible while satisfying the distance constraint.
   - The `make_array` function correctly fills the arrays to meet the conditions of the problem.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
