Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to vertices.
   - Edges are added between pairs of vertices \((i, j)\) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of cliques needed using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
   - It calls `make_array` to fill the `arr` array and `cliquess` array.
   - It prints the filled `arr`, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess`.

3. **Function `make_array`:**
   - This function fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays based on the given `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` to distribute elements evenly.
   - It splits the range into two parts and assigns elements accordingly.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Number of Cliques Calculation:**
   - The formula `ceil(n / k)` is used to calculate the number of cliques. This is a reasonable approach because each clique can have at most \( k \) vertices (considering the constraint \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \)).

2. **Array Filling Logic:**
   - The `make_array` function tries to split the range `[left, right]` into two parts and assign elements to these parts.
   - However, the logic for splitting the range might not always result in a valid assignment that minimizes the number of cliques.

3. **Edge Condition Check:**
   - The condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) needs to be checked for all pairs of vertices to ensure the graph is correctly partitioned.
   - The current implementation does not explicitly check this condition, but rather relies on the initial assignment of elements.

4. **Partitioning into Cliques:**
   - The `cliquess` array is filled to indicate which clique each vertex belongs to.
   - This part seems to be correctly implemented, but the initial assignment of elements might not always minimize the number of cliques.

### Example Test Case Analysis:

Given the example input:
```
3
2 3
5 4
8 16
```

- For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \):
  - The number of cliques is \( \lceil 2 / 3 \rceil = 1 \).
  - Assigning \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 2 \) results in only one clique since \( |1 - 2| + |1 - 2| = 2 \le 3 \).

- For \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 4 \):
  - The number of cliques is \( \lceil 5 / 4 \rceil = 2 \).
  - Assigning \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), \( a_3 = 5 \), \( a_4 = 3 \), \( a_5 = 4 \) results in two cliques: \([1, 2]\) and \([3, 4, 5]\).

- For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \):
  - The number of cliques is \( \lceil 8 / 16 \rceil = 1 \).
  - Assigning \( a_1 = 1 \) to \( a_8 = 8 \) results in only one clique since the maximum distance is \( 7 \le 16 \).

### Conclusion:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by assigning elements and calculating the number of cliques. However, the logic for splitting the range and assigning elements might not always result in the minimum number of cliques. Therefore, while the program might work for some cases, it is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution for all cases.

**Correctness: False**
