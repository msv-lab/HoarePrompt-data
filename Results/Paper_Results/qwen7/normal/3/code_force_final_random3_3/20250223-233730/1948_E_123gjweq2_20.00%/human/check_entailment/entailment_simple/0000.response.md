Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires assigning distinct integers to vertices such that the graph formed by these assignments can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the number of cliques needed and fills arrays `arr` and `cliquess` based on the given parameters `n` and `k`.
   - The function `make_array` is responsible for filling parts of the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays based on the specified range and clique identifier.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The `make_array` function divides the range `[left, right]` into two halves and assigns values to these ranges in a way that ensures the adjacency condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is met.

4. **Verification**:
   - For each clique, the `make_array` function ensures that the difference between consecutive elements is less than or equal to `k`, which satisfies the adjacency condition.
   - The `arr` array is filled with distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and the `cliquess` array is filled with the corresponding clique identifiers.

5. **Output**:
   - The output format matches the requirements: the values assigned to the vertices, the number of cliques, and the partition of vertices into cliques.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to achieve the desired graph partitioning. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
