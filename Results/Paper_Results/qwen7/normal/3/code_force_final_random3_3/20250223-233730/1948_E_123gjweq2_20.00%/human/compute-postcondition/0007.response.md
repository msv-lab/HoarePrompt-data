Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `mid` must be greater than 0.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is equal to `clique`.
- `arr[left + i]` is equal to `small_element + i`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(mid):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `mid - 1`. Therefore, the only variables affected by the loop are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1` if it was `0` in the previous iteration.
   - The value of `mid` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but based on the given information, no such modification is mentioned.

3. **Updating the State**:
   - `mid` must still be greater than 0 because the loop continues as long as `i < mid`.
   - `cliquess[left + i]` will now be `cliquess[left + 1]` (since `i` increases by 1).
   - `arr[left + i]` will now be `arr[left + 1]` (since `i` increases by 1).

### Final State:
- `mid` must still be greater than 0.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is now `cliquess[left + 1]`.
- `arr[left + i]` is now `arr[left + 1]`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`mid` must be greater than 0; `cliquess[left + i]` is equal to `cliquess[left + 1]`; `arr[left + i]` is equal to `arr[left + 1]`**
