Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where no pair of friends are each other's best friends. In such a scenario, the program always prints 2, which is incorrect. For example, consider the input:

```
3
2
2 1
```

In this case, no friend is each other's best friend, and the correct output should be 2 (inviting both friends), but the program incorrectly prints 2 without checking this condition. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
