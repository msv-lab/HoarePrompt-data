Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `x` is a positive integer and less than `n`, `flag` is `True`, and `l` is a list of integers created from the input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `x`, `flag`, or `l`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such context is provided, the variables retain their initial states, and the only effect is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional it was in.
