Postcondition: `i` is `x + 1`, `x` is a positive integer and less than `n`, `flag` is `True`, and `l` is a list of integers created from the input. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` remains `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `l[l[i] - 1]` does not equal `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` remains `True` and no change occurs to the loop or if statement status.
