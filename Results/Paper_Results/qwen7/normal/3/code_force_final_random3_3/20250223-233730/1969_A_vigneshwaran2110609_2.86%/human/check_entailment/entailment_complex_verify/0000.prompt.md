You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `flag` is `True`, `x` takes on its final value after all iterations, which is the last value it was assigned during the loop, and `l` is the list of integers created from the input after all iterations.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop variable `i` will have been incremented to `n` since the loop runs from `0` to `x-1` (inclusive). The variable `flag` will be `True` if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was ever met during any iteration of the inner loop, causing the loop to break. If the condition was never met, `flag` will remain `False`, but the problem statement guarantees that `flag` is `True` after the loop, meaning the condition was met at some point. The value of `x` will be the last value it was assigned during the loop, which is the value of `x` when the loop exited. The list `l` will contain the integers read from the input and will not change during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it reads an additional integer `x` and a list of integers `l`. It checks if any element `l[i]` in the list `l` satisfies the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. If such an element is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such element is found after checking all elements, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where no pair of friends are each other's best friends. In such a scenario, the program always prints 2, which is incorrect. For example, consider the input:

```
3
2
2 1
```

In this case, no friend is each other's best friend, and the correct output should be 2 (inviting both friends), but the program incorrectly prints 2 without checking this condition. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
