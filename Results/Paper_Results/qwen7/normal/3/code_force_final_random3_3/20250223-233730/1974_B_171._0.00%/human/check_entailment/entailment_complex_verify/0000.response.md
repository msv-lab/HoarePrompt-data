### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The auxiliary string \( r \) is constructed by taking all distinct characters from the original string \( s \) and sorting them alphabetically.
- Each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in \( r \).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(encoded)`**:
   - Initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the mapping between characters in the encoded string and the auxiliary string \( r \).
   - Initializes an empty list `decoded` to store the decoded characters.
   - Iterates through each character in the encoded string:
     - If the character is already in the `mapping`, append the mapped character to `decoded`.
     - Otherwise, find the next available character in the alphabet that hasn't been used yet and map it to the current character in the encoded string.
     - Append the newly found character to `decoded`.

2. **Issue with the Current Implementation**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly construct the auxiliary string \( r \). Instead, it simply assigns the next available character in the alphabet to each unique character in the encoded string.
   - This approach fails to maintain the correct mapping between characters in the encoded string and their symmetric counterparts in \( r \).

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the encoded string `"serofedsoc"`.
   - The auxiliary string \( r \) should be `"cdefors"`.
   - The correct decoding process should map:
     - 's' to 'c'
     - 'e' to 'o'
     - 'r' to 'f'
     - 'o' to 'd'
     - 'f' to 'e'
     - 'd' to 'r'
     - 's' to 'c'
   - However, the current implementation assigns:
     - 's' to 'c'
     - 'e' to 't' (incorrectly, should be 'o')
     - 'r' to 'u' (incorrectly, should be 'f')
     - 'o' to 'v' (incorrectly, should be 'd')
     - 'f' to 'w' (incorrectly, should be 'e')
     - 'd' to 'x' (incorrectly, should be 'r')
     - 's' to 'y' (incorrectly, should be 'c')

   - As a result, the output is `"cytvuxyzzyz"`, which is clearly incorrect.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly implement the required decoding logic. It fails to construct the auxiliary string \( r \) and correctly map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly decode the encoded string according to the problem description.
