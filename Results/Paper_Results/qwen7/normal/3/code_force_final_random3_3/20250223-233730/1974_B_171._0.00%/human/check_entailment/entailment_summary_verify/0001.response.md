### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. However, upon closer inspection, there are several issues with the provided program and its logic.

1. **Reverse Mapping Construction:**
   - The program attempts to construct a reverse mapping from the encoded string to the original string. However, the logic for finding the next unused character in the alphabet is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the symmetry required for the decoding process.
   - The program should map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in the auxiliary string `r`. Instead, it assigns characters sequentially without considering the symmetry.

2. **Symmetry Consideration:**
   - The auxiliary string `r` is constructed in alphabetical order, but the program does not ensure that each character in the encoded string is mapped to its symmetric counterpart. For example, if `r` is `"cdefors"`, the character `'c'` should map to `'s'`, `'d'` to `'r'`, and so on. The current implementation does not achieve this symmetry.

3. **Function Summary Mismatch:**
   - The function summary states that the function decodes the input string according to a custom mapping rule where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z', ensuring each letter appears exactly once in the output. This is fundamentally different from the problem description, which requires mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart in the auxiliary string `r`.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly implement the decoding logic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
3. Decode the encoded string using this mapping.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Construct the auxiliary string r
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    
    # Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric counterpart
    mapping = {char: r[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    
    # Decode the encoded string using the mapping
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    
    return decoded
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis, the original program does not correctly implement the decoding logic as required by the problem statement. The corrected implementation above addresses the issues and ensures that the encoded string is decoded correctly.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**
