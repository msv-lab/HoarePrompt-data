Output State: **`c` is 98; mapping['c'] is 'b' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `c` and `mapping['c']`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is inside. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified, we assume it breaks out of an implied one. Therefore, the values of `c` and `mapping['c']` remain unchanged, and the break statement indicates that we exit the loop or conditional.
