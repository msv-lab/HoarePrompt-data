Output State: **`c` must be within the range 99 to 124 (inclusive), `char` is the next character in `encoded`, and `decoded` remains unchanged unless `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping[chr(c)]` is now equal to `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where the assignment to `mapping[chr(c)]` might have occurred. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variable's value directly, the values of `c`, `char`, and the relationship between `chr(c)` and `mapping` remain unchanged.
