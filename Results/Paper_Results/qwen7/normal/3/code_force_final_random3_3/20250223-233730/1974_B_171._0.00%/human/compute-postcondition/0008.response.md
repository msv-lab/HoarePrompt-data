Output State: **`c` is 97; `chr(c)` is mapped to `char` in `mapping`; `mapping` is a dictionary with one more entry.**

Explanation: The code assigns `chr(c)` to the key `char` in the dictionary `mapping`. Given that `c` is 97, `chr(97)` is 'a'. So, `mapping['a']` is set to `char`. The initial conditions that `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping` and `mapping` is a dictionary remain true after the assignment.
