Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)`. The variable being iterated over is `c`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 98.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `c` is within the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. The range for lowercase English letters is from `97` (ord('a')) to `122` (ord('z') + 1).

4. **Next Iteration**: Since `c` is currently 98, which is within the range `97` to `122`, the loop will continue to the next value of `c`, which is `99`.

5. **State Adjustment**: We need to update the state to reflect the next value of `c` and ensure no conditions inside the loop would cause an early exit.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`c` is 99**
