Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `mapping` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `mapping`. This does not affect the value of `encoded` or the length `n` of the string `encoded`. Therefore, the length constraint and the nature of `encoded` remain unchanged.
