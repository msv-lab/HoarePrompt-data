Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`num_cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string (`n`) and the encoded string itself (`encoded`).

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes an encoded string and returns the decoded string.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the reverse mapping of characters.
   - It also initializes an empty list `decoded` to store the decoded characters.

3. **Building the Reverse Mapping:**
   - For each character in the encoded string, it checks if the character is already in the `mapping`.
     - If it is, it appends the corresponding decoded character from the `mapping` to `decoded`.
     - If it is not, it finds the next available character in the alphabet (from 'a' to 'z') that hasn't been used yet.
       - It uses a loop to find the next unused character by checking if the character is not already a value in the `mapping`.
       - Once found, it adds this character to the `mapping` with the current encoded character as the key.
       - It then appends this character to `decoded`.

4. **Returning the Decoded String:**
   - Finally, it joins the list `decoded` into a string and returns it.

### Verification:

- **Reverse Mapping Construction:** 
  - The program correctly constructs the reverse mapping from the encoded string to the original string by ensuring that each character in the encoded string maps back to the correct character in the original string.
  - The use of the `mapping` dictionary ensures that each character in the encoded string is uniquely mapped to a character in the original string.

- **Character Assignment:**
  - The program ensures that each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in the auxiliary string `r`, which is constructed in alphabetical order.
  - The loop to find the next unused character in the alphabet ensures that the mapping is correct and unique.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where the encoded string might have repeated characters or characters that need to be mapped to different positions in the original string.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
