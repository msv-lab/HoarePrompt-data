Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `c`, which is being assigned values from `range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over all characters from 'a' to 'z'. This means `c` will take on each value in this range during the loop iterations.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `c`**: Since the loop starts with `c` taking the value `ord('a')`, which is 97 (the ASCII value of 'a'), the initial state of `c` should be set to 97.

4. **Check if the Initial State of `c` Satisfies the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `c` is less than or equal to `ord('z')`, which is 122 (the ASCII value of 'z'). Therefore, the initial value of `c` (which is 97) satisfies this condition.

5. **Consider the Other Given Variables**: The variable `char` is a character, and `mapping` does not contain the character `char`. These variables are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `c`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`c` is 97**
