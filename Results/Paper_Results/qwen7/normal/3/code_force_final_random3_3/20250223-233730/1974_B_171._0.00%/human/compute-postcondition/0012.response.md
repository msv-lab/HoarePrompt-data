Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 97.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. This means it starts from 97 (which is `ord('a')`) and goes up to 122 (which is `ord('z')`).
3. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` has one more entry.

Given that `c` is currently 97, which corresponds to 'a', let's determine the next value of `c` and the conditions under which the loop will continue.

- The next value of `c` would be 98, which corresponds to 'b'.
- For the loop to continue, `chr(98)` ('b') should not already be a value in `mapping`.

Since the loop condition only depends on the value of `c` and the state of `mapping` is not explicitly mentioned as being modified within the loop body (other than potentially adding an entry), we can assume that the loop will continue as long as `c` is within the specified range and `chr(c)` is not already in `mapping`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `c` will be 98.

**State: **`c` is 98**
