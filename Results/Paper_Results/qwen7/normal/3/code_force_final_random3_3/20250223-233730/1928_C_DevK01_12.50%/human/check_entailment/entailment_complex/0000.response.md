Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position and the number he received during the settling fit the described pattern. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) Vasya received must fit within the repeating pattern of the settling.
   - The key insight is that \( k \) must be a divisor of \( 2(n - x + 1) \) and \( k \) must be greater than 1.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find all divisors of \( q = 2(n - x + 1) \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It correctly identifies the divisors and ensures that only those meeting the criteria are included in the list `M`.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
   - The result is processed to ensure only unique values are counted.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) correctly by adding additional divisors.
   - The logic for handling these edge cases is sound.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
