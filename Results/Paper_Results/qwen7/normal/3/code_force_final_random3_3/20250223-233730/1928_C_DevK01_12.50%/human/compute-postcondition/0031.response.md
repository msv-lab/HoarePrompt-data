Output State: **`q` is a perfect square, `w` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `M` is a list containing the value of `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [i]` appends the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) to the list `M`. The values of `q`, `w`, and `i` are updated as described, and the condition for `M` is also updated accordingly. The initial conditions for `q`, `w`, and the behavior of `i` and `M` remain valid post-execution.
