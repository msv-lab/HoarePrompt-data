Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, q and x. q is an integer representing the position in the line, and x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling. The function calculates all divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1 and returns them in a list M. If the square root of q (denoted as w) is an integer and greater than or equal to x - 1, it is added to the list M. The function then iterates through numbers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of q, checking if they are divisors of q and if they are greater than or equal to x - 1, adding them to the list M. Similarly, it checks their corresponding divisors (q divided by the current number) and adds those to the list M if they meet the criteria.**
