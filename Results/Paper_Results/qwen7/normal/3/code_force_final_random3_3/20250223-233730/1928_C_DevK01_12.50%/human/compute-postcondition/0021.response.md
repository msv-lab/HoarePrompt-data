Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `w`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(w // 1)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `w`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `q` is a perfect square.
   - `w` is an integer greater than 0.
   - There exists an integer `i` such that `q % i == 0`.
   - If the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the value of `q // i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value less than `w`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`.
   - `w` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `q` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `M` remains unchanged unless the new `i` (which is `i + 1`) meets the condition `i >= x - 1`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, and assuming `i` was less than `w` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `q` is still a perfect square.
- `w` is still an integer greater than 0.
- There exists an integer `i` such that `q % i == 0`, but now `i` is `i + 1`.
- `M` remains unchanged unless `i + 1 >= x - 1`.

State: **`q` is a perfect square, `w` is an integer greater than 0, and there exists an integer `i` such that `q % i == 0` and `i` is `i + 1`. `M` remains unchanged.**
