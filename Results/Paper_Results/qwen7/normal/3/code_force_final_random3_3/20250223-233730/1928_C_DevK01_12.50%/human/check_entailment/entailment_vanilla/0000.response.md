Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculating the Range for `k`:**
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, the program prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
   - If `y` is even, it proceeds to call the function `func_1` with `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It first checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and includes it in the list `M`.
   - Then, it iterates through all integers from `1` to `int(w // 1)` (where `w` is the square root of `q`), checking if they are divisors of `q` and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, they are added to `M`.
   - Finally, it returns the unique values in `M`.

4. **Adjusting for the Range:**
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, the program calls `func_1` again with `((n - x) // 2)` and `x`.
   - The results from both calls are combined and printed the length of the unique values.

### Verification:

#### Correctness of `func_1`:
- The function correctly identifies all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- The use of the square root to find divisors is efficient and correct.

#### Handling of `y`:
- The condition `if y % 2 != 0:` correctly identifies when `y` is odd, leading to `0` as the result.
- The calculation of `q = (y - 2) // 2` and subsequent handling in `func_1` is correct.

#### Handling of the Range Adjustment:
- The check `if n >= 3 * x - 2:` ensures that the second call to `func_1` is made only when necessary.
- The combination of results from both calls and the use of `set` to ensure uniqueness is correct.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases and performs the necessary calculations accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
