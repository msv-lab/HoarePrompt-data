Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used in an incorrect manner. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a list of possible values for `k` based on certain conditions, but its implementation does not align with the problem description.

Let's analyze the issue:

1. The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`. If `y` is odd, the program prints `0`, which is correct because no valid `k` exists for odd `y`.

2. When `y` is even, the program calls `func_1` with `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`. However, the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly determine the valid values of `k`.

3. The condition `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1` is incorrect. It checks if `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, but this does not correctly determine the valid values of `k`.

4. The loop `for i in range(1, int(w // 1))` is also problematic. It should iterate over the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

To fix this, the function `func_1` should be revised to correctly generate the valid values of `k` based on the conditions described in the problem. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    for i in range(x - 1, q + 1):
        if q % i == 0 and i <= q // i:
            M.append(i)
    return M
```

With this corrected function, the main program would look like this:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue
```

This corrected version should handle all cases correctly according to the problem description.
