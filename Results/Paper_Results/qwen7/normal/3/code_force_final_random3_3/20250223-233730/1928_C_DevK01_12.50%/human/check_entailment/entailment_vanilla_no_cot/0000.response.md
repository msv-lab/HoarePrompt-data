Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**: 
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, but according to the problem, the formula should be `y = 2 * n - x`.

2. **Function `func_1` Usage**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with arguments `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`, which might not be correct for all cases. It should be adjusted to handle the correct logic.

3. **Set Operations**:
   - The use of `set` to eliminate duplicates is unnecessary and might lead to incorrect results. The list `L1` should be handled differently.

4. **Logic for Calculating Valid `k` Values**:
   - The logic for determining the valid values of `k` needs to be corrected. Specifically, the conditions and calculations need to be aligned with the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = 2 * n - x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        y //= 2
        L1 = func_1(y, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M.append(w)
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1) + 1):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M.append(i)
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M.append(q // i)
    return M
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should provide the correct number of possible values for `k` based on the given constraints.
