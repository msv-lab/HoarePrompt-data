Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n-2, `v1` is the second last element of `vx`, `v2` is the second last element of `vx`, and `ops` is a list containing one tuple (v1, v2)**.

Explanation: The code `v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)` updates the values of `v1` and `v2` to be the second last element of the set `vx`. Since `vx` contains integers from 1 to n-2, the second last element of `vx` is n-3. Therefore, `v1` and `v2` both become n-3. The condition for `ops` remains unchanged because `v2` is still greater than 0. Hence, `ops` contains one tuple (v1, v2), which is (n-3, n-3).
