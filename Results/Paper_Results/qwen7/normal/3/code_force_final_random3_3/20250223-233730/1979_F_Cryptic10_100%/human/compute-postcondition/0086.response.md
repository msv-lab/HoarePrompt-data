Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `vx` is an empty set.
   - `ops` is an empty list.
   - `p1` is an empty set and an empty list.
   - `p2` is the last tuple in `ops` if the last element of the last tuple in `ops` equals the second last element of `ops`, otherwise `p1` appends all `v1` values from `ops` to itself.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs `int(input())` times.

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider how the loop modifies the states of `vx`, `ops`, `p1`, and `p2`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `vx` remains an empty set as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `ops` is iterated over in reverse (`ops[::-1]`), and its elements are consumed during each iteration. Therefore, after each iteration, the length of `ops` decreases by one.
   - `p1` starts as an empty set and list. During each iteration, `p2` is updated based on the condition `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)`. This means `p1` or `p2` (depending on the condition) will append `v1` to itself.
   - `p2` is initially the last tuple in `ops` if the last element of the last tuple in `ops` equals the second last element of `ops`, otherwise `p1` appends all `v1` values from `ops` to itself.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `ops` will have one less element than before.
   - `p1` will either remain unchanged or append `v1` to itself depending on the condition.
   - `p2` will be updated based on the new value of `p1` and the current tuple in `ops`.

Given the above points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `vx` remains an empty set.
- `ops` will have one less element than before.
- `p1` will either remain an empty set and list or will have appended `v1` to itself.
- `p2` will be updated based on the new value of `p1` and the current tuple in `ops`.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` depend on the loop body, we can only generalize the states:

State: **`vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list with one less element than before, `p1` is an empty set and an empty list or contains some `v1` values, `p2` is updated based on the new value of `p1` and the current tuple in `ops`**.

However, for a concrete example, let's assume the first tuple in `ops` is processed:

State: **`vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list with one less element than before, `p1` is an empty set and an empty list or contains the `v1` value from the first tuple in `ops`, `p2` is the last tuple in `ops` if the last element of the last tuple in `ops` equals the second last element of `ops`, otherwise `p1` contains the `v1` value from the first tuple in `ops`**.

For simplicity, let's assume `p1` and `p2` are updated as follows:

State: **`vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list with one less element than before, `p1` is an empty set and an empty list or contains the `v1` value from the first tuple in `ops`, `p2` is the last tuple in `ops` if the last element of the last tuple in `ops` equals the second last element of `ops`, otherwise `p1` contains the `v1` value from the first tuple in `ops`**.

State: **`vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list with one less element than before, `p1` is an empty set and an empty list or contains the `v1` value from the first tuple in `ops`, `p2` is the last tuple in `ops` if the last element of the last tuple in `ops` equals the second last element of `ops`, otherwise `p1` contains the `v1` value from the first tuple in `ops`**.
