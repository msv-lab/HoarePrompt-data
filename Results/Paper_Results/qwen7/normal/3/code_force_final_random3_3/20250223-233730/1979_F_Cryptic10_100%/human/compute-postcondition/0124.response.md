Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `ops` is unchanged except for the last tuple which now has its first element appended with `v1`.
- `v1` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
- `v2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.

### Loop Head:
```
for (v1, v2) in ops[::-1]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variables**: The loop iterates over tuples from `ops` in reverse order. Each tuple `(v1, v2)` corresponds to elements from the reversed `ops` list.
2. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to access another tuple in the reversed list. This means the current tuple being processed should not be the last tuple in the reversed list.

### Current State:
- The last tuple in the reversed list has its first element appended with `v1`.
- The second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list is the source of `v1` and `v2`.

### Adjusting States:
- Since the loop is iterating in reverse, the next tuple to be processed would be the one before the last tuple in the reversed list.
- The last tuple in the reversed list is the one that has its first element appended with `v1`, so the tuple before it is the one we need to focus on.
- The first element of this tuple (before appending `v1`) is `v1`, and the second element is `v2`.

### Updated States:
- `ops` remains unchanged except for the last tuple which still has its first element appended with `v1`.
- `v1` is the first element of the tuple before the last tuple in the reversed list.
- `v2` is the second element of the tuple before the last tuple in the reversed list.

### Final State:
State: **`ops` is unchanged except for the last tuple which has its first element appended with `v1`; `v1` is the first element of the tuple before the last tuple in the reversed list; `v2` is the second element of the tuple before the last tuple in the reversed list.**
