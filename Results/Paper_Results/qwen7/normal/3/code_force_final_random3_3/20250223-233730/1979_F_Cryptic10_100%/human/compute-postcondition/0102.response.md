Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing one additional tuple `(v1, v2)` where `v1` is the fourth last element of `vx` and `v2` is the third last element of `vx`, `p1` and `p2` are both empty sets.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Here, `v1` is the fourth last element of `vx` and `v2` is the third last element of `vx`. The other variables (`vx`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
