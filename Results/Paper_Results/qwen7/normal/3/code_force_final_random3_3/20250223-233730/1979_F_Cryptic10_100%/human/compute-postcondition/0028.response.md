Output State: **`vx` does not contain `v3`, `v2` is the new second last element of `vx`, and `ops` is a list containing three tuples: (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and whatever the original second tuple in `ops` was.**

Explanation: The code appends two new tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` to the list `ops`. The initial state of `vx` and `v2` remains unchanged, and the list `ops` now contains three tuples instead of two.
