Output State: **`vx` has exactly 2 elements remaining, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration, `p1` is now a list containing the elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `p1, p2 = list(vx), []` first assigns the elements of `vx` to `p1` by converting `vx` to a list (since `vx` is already a list, this step doesn't change its content). Then, it assigns an empty list to `p2`. The other variables (`vx`, `ops`, `p1`, and `p2`) are updated accordingly.
