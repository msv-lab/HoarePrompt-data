Output State: **`vx` has at least 1 element, `v1` is removed from `vx`, `v2` is now the element at index len(`vx`) - 1, `v3` is the first element returned by function `q(0)`.**

Explanation: The code `v3, _ = q(0)` calls the function `q` with argument `0`. The function returns two values, but the second one is ignored (denoted by `_`). The first value returned by `q(0)` is assigned to `v3`. The precondition that `vx` has at least 2 elements and `v1` is removed from `vx`, and `v2` is now the element at index `len(vx) - 1` remains unchanged.
