Output State: `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing zero or more tuples depending on the number of times the loop executed, `p1` is a list containing the first element of the final `vx` (which is an empty set) and an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues to run as long as the length of `vx` is greater than 2. Each iteration removes elements from `vx` and appends operations to `ops`. Eventually, when `vx` is reduced to 2 elements or fewer, the loop will terminate. Given that the loop removes elements from `vx` and `vx` starts with a range of integers from 1 up to the input integer, after all iterations, `vx` will be an empty set. The list `ops` will contain all the operations performed during the loop's iterations, and `p1` will reflect the state of `vx` at the end of the loop, which is an empty set, along with an empty list.
