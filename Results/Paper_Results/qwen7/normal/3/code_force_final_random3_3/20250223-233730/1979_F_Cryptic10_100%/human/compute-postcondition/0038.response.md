Output State: **`ops` is a list with its last element being the result of appending `v1` to the list (`p2` if `p1[-1] == v2` else `p1`).**

Explanation: The code checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. If it is, then `p2` is used; otherwise, `p1` is used. In both cases, `v1` is appended to the selected list. Since the initial state requires `ops` to have at least one element, `ops` is updated to include `v1` in the list based on the condition.
