Reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction and Removal Process**: The program correctly simulates the process of removing edges from a complete graph. It uses the query function to determine the degrees of vertices and identify which vertices to remove. Specifically, it identifies vertices with the minimum degree and ensures that the vertex with the smallest index is selected when there are ties.

2. **Hamiltonian Path Construction**: The program constructs a Hamiltonian path by maintaining two lists (`p1` and `p2`) and reversing the order of operations to reconstruct the path. This approach is sound because it ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once, and the path respects the removal order of vertices.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles the edge case where the remaining graph has only two vertices by directly constructing the path. This is correct since a path between two vertices is trivially a Hamiltonian path.

4. **Query Limit Compliance**: The program ensures that it does not exceed the allowed number of queries (at most `n` queries per test case).

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the Hamiltonian path in the correct format, ensuring that each vertex is listed exactly once in the order they appear in the path.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem specification correctly and should work as intended for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
