Postcondition: **`vx` has at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing either one tuple `(v1, v2)` or three tuples `(v1, v2)`, `(v3, 0)`, and `(v1, 0)`, `p1` and `p2` are both empty sets, `v1` is the fourth last element of `vx`, and `v2` is the third last element of `vx`. If `v2 > 0`, `v3` is not included in `vx`; otherwise, `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)` and is removed from `vx`.**
