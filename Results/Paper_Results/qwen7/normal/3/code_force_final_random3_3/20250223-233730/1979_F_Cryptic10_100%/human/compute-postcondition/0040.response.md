Output State: **`ops` is a list with its last element being the result of appending `v1` to the list (`p2` if `p1[-1] == v2` else `p1`)**.

Explanation: The code `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)` appends `v1` to the list that is determined by the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, it appends `v1` to `p2`; otherwise, it appends `v1` to `p1`. Since the last element of `ops` was already the result of this operation before the last element was removed, the last element of `ops` remains unchanged except for the append operation specified by the condition. Therefore, the last element of `ops` is updated according to the condition, and the rest of the list remains as it was in the initial state.
