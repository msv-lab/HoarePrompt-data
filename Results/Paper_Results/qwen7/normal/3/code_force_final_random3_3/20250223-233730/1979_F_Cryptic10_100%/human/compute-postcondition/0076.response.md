Output State: **`vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list of operations performed during the loop, `p1` is an empty set and an empty list.**

Explanation: The code assigns `vx` to an empty set and `p1` to an empty set along with an empty list. The value of `p2` is explicitly set to an empty list. The list `ops` retains all the operations performed during the loop's iterations. Therefore, the output state is `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list of operations, and `p1` is an empty set and an empty list.
