Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes an integer `t` within the range of 1 to 1000 and an integer `n` within the range of 2 to 10^5 for each test case. It ensures that the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function returns information based on the values of `t` and `n` for each test case.**
