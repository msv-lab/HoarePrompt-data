Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 for each test case, a lambda function `q` is defined which prints '? %d' % d followed by reading a line of input split into integers and returning them as a map object.**

The lambda function `q` is defined to take an argument `d` and print a formatted string `'? %d' % d` and then read a line of input split into integers using `input().split()`. However, the function does not assign these integers to any variable, so the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
