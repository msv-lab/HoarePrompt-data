Output State: **`vx` must have more than 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing either one tuple `(v1, v2)` where `v2 > 0` or two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` where `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)`, `p1` and `p2` are both empty sets, `v1` is now the third last element of `vx`, and `v2` is now the second last element of `vx`.**

Explanation: The code `v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)` updates the values of `v1` and `v2` by calling the function `q` with the argument `len(vx) - 2`. Here, `len(vx) - 2` corresponds to the third last element of `vx` (since `len(vx) - 2` is the index of the third last element). Therefore, `v1` is now set to the third last element of `vx`, and `v2` is now set to the second last element of `vx`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
