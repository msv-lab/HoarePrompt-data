Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to at least 1, `ops` is a list containing three tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `p1` is a list containing the first element of the updated `vx` and an empty list, `v1` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 1`, and `v2` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 1` and is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the result of `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.**

Explanation:
- The line `ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` appends two tuples to the list `ops`. Since `v3` was previously removed from `vx`, it is added back along with `(v1, 0)`. This results in `ops` containing four elements: `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
