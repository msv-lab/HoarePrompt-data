Output State: `ops` remains unchanged; `p1` contains the elements of `vx` after all operations have been applied; `p2` is an empty list.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `p1` will contain the final state of `vx` after applying all the operations specified in `ops`. The operations are applied in reverse order due to the `[::-1]` slicing used in the loop. `p2` remains an empty list as it is not affected by any operations within the loop. `ops` itself does not change; it only gets modified in-place by appending the first element of each tuple to the conditional list (`p2` or `p1`), but since we are asked for the final state, `ops` remains as initially provided.
