Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` has exactly 2 elements remaining, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed during each iteration, `p1` is now a list containing the elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ops` is unchanged except for the last tuple which now has its first element appended with `v1`; `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops` before the operation; `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops` before the operation.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ops` is unchanged except for the last tuple which now has its first element appended with `v1`; `v1` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list; `v2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ops` is unchanged except for the last tuple which now has its first element appended with `v1`; `v1` is the first element of the tuple before the last tuple in the reversed list; `v2` is the second element of the tuple before the last tuple in the reversed list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
