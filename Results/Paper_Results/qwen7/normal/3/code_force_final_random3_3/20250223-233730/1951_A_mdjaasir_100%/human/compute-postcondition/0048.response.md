Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string from the user, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If `count` > 2 and `count` is even, then `count` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**
