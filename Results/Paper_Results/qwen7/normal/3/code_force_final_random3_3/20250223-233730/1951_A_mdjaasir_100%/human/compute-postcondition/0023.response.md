Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string from the user, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, and `count` is exactly 2. If the character immediately following the first '1' in `a` is not '1', the current value of `a` has at least two '1's with the second '1' not immediately followed by another '1'. Otherwise, the character immediately following the first '1' in `a` is '1'.
