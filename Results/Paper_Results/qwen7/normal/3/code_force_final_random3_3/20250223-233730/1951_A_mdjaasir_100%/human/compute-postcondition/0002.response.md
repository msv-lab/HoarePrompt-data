Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is the integer input by the user.
