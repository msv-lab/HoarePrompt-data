Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is an input integer from the split input.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input separated by a space and splits them into two variables `x` and `y`. It converts the input strings to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `x` is updated to the first integer input, and `y` is updated to the second integer input. The condition that `x` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
