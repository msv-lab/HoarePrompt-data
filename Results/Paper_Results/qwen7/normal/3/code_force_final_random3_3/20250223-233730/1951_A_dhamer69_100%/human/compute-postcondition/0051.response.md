The loop condition is `t > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. Given that `t` is at least 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the only way to ensure the loop executes again is to make sure `t` is greater than 0.

Since no other variables in the loop head affect the loop condition, no adjustments are needed for `n` or `s`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string**
