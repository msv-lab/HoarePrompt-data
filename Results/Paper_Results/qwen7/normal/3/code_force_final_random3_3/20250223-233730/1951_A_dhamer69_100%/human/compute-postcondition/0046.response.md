Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, or `count_1`. If `count_1` is even, no specific changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, or `count_1`, except when `s` contains exactly one instance of '11' and `count_1` equals 2, no changes are made in this case as well.
