Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user, `n` is not equal to 2, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the function does not change the value of `count_1`. Otherwise, `count_1` is either 2 and `s` contains exactly one instance of '11', or `count_1` is not 2 or `s.count('11') != 1`.
