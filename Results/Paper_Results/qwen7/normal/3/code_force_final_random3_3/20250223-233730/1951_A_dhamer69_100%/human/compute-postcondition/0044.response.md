Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`, the program does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1`. Otherwise, the program does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1`.
