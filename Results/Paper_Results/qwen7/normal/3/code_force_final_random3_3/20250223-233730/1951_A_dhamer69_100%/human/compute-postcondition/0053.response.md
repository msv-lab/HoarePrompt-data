Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is replaced by the new input string, and the new input string is stored in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` replaces the value of `s` with a new string input from the user. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
