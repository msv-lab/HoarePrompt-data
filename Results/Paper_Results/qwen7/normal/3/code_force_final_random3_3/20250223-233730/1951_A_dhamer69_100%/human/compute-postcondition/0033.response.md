Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user, and the following conditions hold:
- If `n` equals 2, then `s` is either '00' or not '00'.
- If `n` is not 2, then `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the value of `count_1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count_1` is either 2 and `s` contains exactly one instance of '11', or `count_1` is not 2 or `s.count('11')` is not 1.**

Explanation: The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
