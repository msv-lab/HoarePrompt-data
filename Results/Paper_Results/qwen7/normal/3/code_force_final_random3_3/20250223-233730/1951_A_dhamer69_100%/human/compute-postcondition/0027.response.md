Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user, `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`, and either `s` contains exactly one instance of '11' and the count of '1' in `s` is 2, or `s.count('11') != 1` or `count_1 != 2`.
