Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `start`, `end`, and `t` remain unchanged.
