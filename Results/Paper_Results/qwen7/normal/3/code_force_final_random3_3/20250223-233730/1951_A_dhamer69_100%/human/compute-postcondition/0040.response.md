Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`.**

The code `count_1 = s.count('1')` counts the occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s` and assigns the count to the variable `count_1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
