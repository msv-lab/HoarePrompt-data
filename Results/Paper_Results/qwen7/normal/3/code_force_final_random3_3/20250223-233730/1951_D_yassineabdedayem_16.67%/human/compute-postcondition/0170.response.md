Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). The function returns different values based on the relationship between n, k, and t for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to process multiple test cases, each containing three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, the function evaluates the relationship between n, k, and t and returns a specific value based on these relationships. However, since the function definition itself does not specify the exact return values or conditions, the focus here is on understanding the implied input structure and expected behavior across multiple test cases.
