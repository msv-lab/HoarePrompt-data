You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

    #State: All variables except `t` will be reset to their initial states after the loop completes. `t` will be 0 since it was decremented by 1 each time the loop ran and there were no further inputs to increment it.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to reduce n to 0 by repeatedly subtracting a value derived from n and k, and prints 'YES' along with the number of operations performed if possible, or 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function outputs no further information.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires setting up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The key points are:
- Alice buys greedily, meaning she buys as many jewels as possible from each stall.
- There are at most 60 stalls.
- Each stall can have a price per jewel between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- We need to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the number of jewels `k`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - It initializes variables `rep` (number of stalls), `number` (price per jewel), and `tab` (list of prices).
   - It enters a loop where it tries to satisfy the condition of buying exactly `k` jewels.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It calculates the minimum (`Min`) and maximum (`Max`) possible prices per jewel.
     - If the maximum price equals `k` and the product of `n` and `Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and updates `k`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and updates `k`.
     - It appends the current `number` to the list `tab`.
     - It updates `n` and increments the stall count `rep`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `k` is zero:
     - If `k` is zero, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the list of prices.
     - If `k` is not zero, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check
1. **Greedy Approach:**
   - The program uses a greedy approach to assign prices to stalls. However, the logic for determining `Min` and `Max` might not always lead to the correct solution.
   - Specifically, the condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k:` seems flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the scenario where Alice needs to buy exactly `k` jewels across multiple stalls.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `n` is very small compared to `k` or vice versa.
   - It assumes that Alice will always buy the maximum possible jewels from each stall, which might not be optimal.

3. **Correct Solution Approach:**
   - A more accurate approach would involve dynamically adjusting the prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - One possible solution is to use binary search or dynamic programming to find the correct prices for each stall.

### Conclusion
Given the flaws in the logic and potential edge cases, the provided program is not correct according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: **False**
