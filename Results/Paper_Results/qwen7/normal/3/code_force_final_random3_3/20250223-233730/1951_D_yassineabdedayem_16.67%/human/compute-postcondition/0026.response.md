Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and `n` is not zero, `k` is a positive integer read from standard input, `rep` is 1, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `k` is adjusted based on whether `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k` holds true or not. If the condition is met, `k` becomes `k - Max`; otherwise, `k` is reduced by `Min`.
