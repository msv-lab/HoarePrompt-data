Output State: **`Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting either `Max` or `Min` based on the condition `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the expressions given. The values of `rep`, `number`, `k`, `tab`, `n`, and their respective conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
