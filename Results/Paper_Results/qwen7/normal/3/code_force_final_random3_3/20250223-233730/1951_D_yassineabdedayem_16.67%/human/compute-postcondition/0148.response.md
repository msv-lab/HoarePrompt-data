Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is n // k if n // k <= k else k, `Max` is int(n / k) if int(n / k) >= k else k, `number` is Max, `k` is k - Min, `rep` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to k and not zero.**

Explanation: The code `k = k - Min` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Min` from it. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `Min` is defined as `n // k` if `n // k <= k` else `k`, and `Max` is defined as `int(n / k)` if `int(n / k) >= k` else `k`. The value of `number` is `Max`, and `rep` remains 2. The conditions on `n` and `k` also remain the same.
