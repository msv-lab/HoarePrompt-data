Based on the initial state provided:

- `tab` is a list with at least one element.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is 0 or less.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is 60.
- `number` is the last value assigned to `number` before the loop ended.
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration.
- `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space. However, the value of `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Typically, `i` would be used in a loop context, but since no loop is shown in the snippet provided, and no explicit value for `i` is given, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.

Given the lack of specific information about `i`, the most precise answer we can provide is:

Output: **i (where i is the value of the loop counter, if any, before the print statement is executed)**
