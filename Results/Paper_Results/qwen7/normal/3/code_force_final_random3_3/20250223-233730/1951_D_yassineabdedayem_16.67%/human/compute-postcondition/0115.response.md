The code reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `i`, `t`, and `number` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code. Since the actual values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can only say that `n` and `k` are assigned the values read from the standard input.

Output State: **`rep` is 60, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of numbers from each iteration of the loop, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `t` is 58, `number` is 0, and `k` is not equal to 0.**
