Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is `min((n // k) - (k), k)`, `Max` is `k - k`, `number` is `min((n // k) - (k), k)`, `k` is `k - k`**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`.
- `Max` is `k`.
- `number` is also `min(n // k, k)`.
- The code `k = k - Max` updates `k` to `k - k`, which results in `k` being 0.
- Since `Min` and `number` are both based on `k`, they get updated to `min((n // k) - (k), k)`, which simplifies to `min(0 - 0, 0) = 0`.
- `students` is 2 less than its initial value, but its exact initial value is not given, so we keep it as "2 less than its initial value".
- `total` remains 0 as no operation affects it.
