Output State: **`n` is reduced to 0 or less, `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions, `rep` is 60, `tab` contains the sequence of numbers generated during the loop's execution, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `t` is decreased by 1 (t-1)**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This changes the values of `n` and `k` based on user input. The other variables (`rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `i`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `t` is decreased by 1.
