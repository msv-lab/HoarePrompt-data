Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `tab`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `tab` contains at least one element. When the loop starts, `i` is set to the first element of `tab`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tab` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` will be set to the first element of `tab`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must still contain at least one element.
   - After the loop starts, `i` will be set to the first element of `tab`. Since we don't know the exact value of the first element, we just need to ensure that `tab` still has at least one element.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `tab` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` will be set to the first element of `tab`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`tab` must contain at least one element, and `i` will be set to the first element of `tab`**
