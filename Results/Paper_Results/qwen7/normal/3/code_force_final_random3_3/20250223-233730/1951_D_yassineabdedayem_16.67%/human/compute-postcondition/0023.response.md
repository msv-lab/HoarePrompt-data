Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and `n` is not zero, `k` is a positive integer read from standard input, `rep` is 1, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `min(n // k, k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `k` is `k - max(int(n / k), k)`**.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` updates the value of `k` to be `k - max(int(n / k), k)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
