Let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 0.
   - `students` is 2 less than its initial value. Since the initial value of `students` is not specified, let's assume it was initially set to some value `S`. Therefore, `students = S - 2`.
   - `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k` for the final iteration.
   - `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` for the final iteration.
   - `number` is either `Min` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max` for the final iteration.
   - `k` is adjusted to `k - Max` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `k` is adjusted to `k - Min` for the final iteration.
   - `rep` is 60.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` for each iteration.
   - The condition `k == 0` is true.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Since `n` is 0, `n // k` and `int(n / k)` will both be 0.
   - Therefore, `Min` and `Max` will be 0.
   - If `Max` equals `k` (which is 0), and `n * Min` (which is 0) is less than or equal to `k` (which is 0), then `number` will be `Min` (which is 0).
   - `k` will be adjusted to `k - Max` (which is 0 - 0 = 0).
   - `tab` will contain the string representation of `number` (which is "0") for each iteration until `k` becomes 0.
   - Given that `k == 0` is true, the loop would have completed, and `tab` will have been populated with "0" repeated multiple times.

3. **Determine the Length of `tab`:**
   - Since `k` is adjusted to 0, and assuming the loop runs until `k` reaches 0, the number of iterations will be determined by how many times `number` is added to `tab`.
   - Without the exact number of iterations, we know that `tab` will contain "0" repeated a certain number of times.
   - The length of `tab` will be the number of iterations, which is not explicitly given but is implied by the condition `k == 0`.

Given the information, the length of `tab` is the number of iterations, which is not explicitly stated but is implied by the condition `k == 0`.

Output: **60**
