Based on the initial state provided:

- `rep` is 60.
- `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of numbers from each iteration of the loop.
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration.
- `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration.
- `i` is the last element of `tab`.
- `t` is decreased by 1 (`t-1`).
- `number` is 0.
- `k` is not equal to 0.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement is explicitly given as `print('NO')`, it will print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
