Postcondition: **`rep` is 60, `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of numbers from each iteration of the loop, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `t` is 59, `number` is 0, and `k` is not equal to 0.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, regardless of whether the condition `k == 0` is met or not, the following conditions hold true: `rep` is 60, `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions, `tab` contains the string representations of numbers from each iteration, `Min` and `Max` reflect the values from the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `t` is 59, `number` is 0, and `k` is not equal to 0.
