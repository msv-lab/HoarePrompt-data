Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 0.
- `students` is 2 less than its initial value, but since no initial value for `students` is given, we cannot determine its exact value.
- `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k` for the final iteration.
- `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` for the final iteration.
- `number` is determined based on conditions involving `Min` and `Max`.
- `k` is adjusted based on the same conditions.
- `rep` is 60.
- `n` is 0.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` for each iteration.
- The condition `k == 0` is true.

Given that `k == 0`, the `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string "YES".

Output: **YES**
