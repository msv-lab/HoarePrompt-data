Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is the first element of `tab`.
   - `tab` must have at least one element.

2. **Understand the loop structure:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `tab`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `tab` must still have at least one element.
   - After the first iteration, `i` would be set to the first element of `tab`, and `tab` would be modified (likely by removing the first element).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` is now the first element of `tab`, it remains unchanged for the next iteration.
   - `tab` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `tab` must still have at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is the first element of `tab`, `tab` must have at least one element**
