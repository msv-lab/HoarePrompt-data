Reasoning:

1. The given program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the string `s` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.
3. It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
4. It calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level by checking how many more are required for each difficulty level that has fewer than `m` problems.
5. The logic to calculate the answer is correct. For each difficulty level, if the count is less than `m`, the difference is added to the total count of additional problems needed.
6. The program prints the result for each test case as expected.

Given the above points, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the example provided.

Correctness: **True**
