Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in how it calculates the number of additional problems needed. The key issue is that the code incorrectly assumes that each difficulty level must appear at least `m` times in the given string `s`. However, the requirement is to ensure that there are enough unique difficulty levels across all rounds, not necessarily that each level appears `m` times.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    d = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Count the occurrences of each difficulty level
    for char in s:
        d[char] += 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed
    required_levels = set('ABCDEFG')
    current_levels = set(d.keys())
    additional_problems = len(required_levels - current_levels)
    
    # If we have fewer than m unique levels, we need to add more
    if len(current_levels) < m:
        additional_problems += m - len(current_levels)
    
    print(additional_problems)
```

This corrected solution ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to cover all required difficulty levels for `m` rounds.
