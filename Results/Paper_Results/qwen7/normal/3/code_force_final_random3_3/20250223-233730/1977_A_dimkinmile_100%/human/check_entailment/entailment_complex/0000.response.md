Reasoning:
The annotated program describes a function `func_1` that correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. The function reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case, and then checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even and non-negative. If the condition is satisfied, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". 

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the function `func_1` correctly handles all the constraints and examples provided. It accurately checks the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

However, there is a discrepancy between the initial code snippet and the annotated program. The initial code snippet does not include the loop to process each test case, which means the program would only handle one test case instead of `t` test cases. Since the annotated program correctly describes the logic within the function, we need to ensure the loop is included to process all test cases.

Despite this discrepancy, the logic within `func_1` itself is correct. Therefore, if the loop is added to the initial code snippet, the overall program would be correct.

Correctness: **False** (due to missing loop to process multiple test cases)

To make the program fully correct, the initial code snippet should be modified as follows:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()
```

With this modification, the program will correctly process all `t` test cases.
