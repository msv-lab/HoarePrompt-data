### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `input()` and converts it to an integer.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is unnecessary and should be removed or properly utilized.
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`. This condition is used to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

3. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
   - This condition is correct because:
     - Each move either adds 1 cube (increasing the count by 1) or removes 1 cube (decreasing the count by 1).
     - To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net change in the number of cubes must be `m`.
     - The net change `m` must be achievable by an even number of moves (since adding and removing cubes alternately results in an even net change).

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' correctly based on the condition.

However, there is a critical issue with the function definition and its usage:

- The function `func_1()` is defined but never called within the main loop. Instead, the variable `kreker` is directly used without any reference to the function. This means the function `func_1()` is not being utilized at all, which is a logical error.

To fix this, the function `func_1()` should be called within the main loop to process each test case. Here is the corrected version:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment overlooked the fact that the function `func_1()` is not being called within the main loop. Without calling `func_1()`, the program does not process any test cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
