### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the condition `if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is insufficient because it fails to account for the fact that the absolute difference between `n` and `m` must be even and non-negative. 

Let's break down the issue:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: \( n > m \)
     - The difference \( n - m \) must be even and non-negative. This part is correctly handled by the current implementation.
   - **Case 2**: \( n < m \)
     - The difference \( m - n \) must be even and non-negative. The current implementation does not handle this case properly because it only checks \( n - m \).
   - **Case 3**: \( n = m \)
     - The difference \( n - m \) is 0, which is even and non-negative. This case is correctly handled by the current implementation.

2. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case \( n = 2 \) and \( m = 4 \).
     - The difference \( n - m = -2 \), which is not greater than or equal to 0. However, it is impossible to achieve 4 cubes after 2 moves because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is 2. The program would incorrectly output "Yes" for this case.

3. **Corrected Condition**:
   - To fix this, we need to use the absolute difference \( |n - m| \) instead of \( n - m \). The corrected condition should be:
     ```python
     if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0 and abs(n - m) >= 0:
         print('Yes')
     else:
         print('No')
     ```

Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The program needs to be modified to use the absolute difference to ensure it correctly handles all cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where \( n < m \). The correct condition should use the absolute difference \( |n - m| \).
