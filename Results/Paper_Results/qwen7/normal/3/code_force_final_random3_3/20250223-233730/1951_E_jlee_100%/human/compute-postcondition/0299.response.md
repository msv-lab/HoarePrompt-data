Output State: **`j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is 0, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `j`, `n`, `x`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement also indicates that the loop will continue executing from the beginning of the next iteration.
