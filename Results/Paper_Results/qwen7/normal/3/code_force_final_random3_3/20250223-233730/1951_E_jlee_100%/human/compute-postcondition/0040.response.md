Postcondition: `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is `False`, the first character of the list `s` (`x`) is not equal to the last element of the list `s`. If the count of the first character `x` in the list `s` is equal to 1, then the function does nothing. Otherwise, the count of `x` in the list `s` is equal to 0, and the condition `(n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x)` is either true or false.
