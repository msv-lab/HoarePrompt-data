Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is 1, `done` is set to True, `count` remains 0, `count2` is greater than `count`, and the character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` of `s`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned and the break statement only affects the flow of the program, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
