Output State: **`j` is `count`, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is a character, `count` is greater than 0, `done` is `False`, `count2` is either `count` (if `s[j]` equals `x`), or it remains as the last calculated value, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, and the condition `(not done)` is true.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the `continue` statement, the values of all variables remain the same as they were before the statement was executed. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
