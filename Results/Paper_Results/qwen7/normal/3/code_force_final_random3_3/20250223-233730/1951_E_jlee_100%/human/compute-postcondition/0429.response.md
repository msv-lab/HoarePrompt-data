Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0
- `n` is the length of the list `s`
- `done` is `True`
- `count` is greater than 0
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`
- `count2` is not equal to `count`
- `count2` is now greater than `count`

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
