Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is assigned the value of `count`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is a character.
- `count` is greater than 1.
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`.
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is equal to `count`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

This statement will print two parts of the string `s`:
1. The substring from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`.
2. The substring starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.

Given the conditions:
- Since `j` is assigned the value of `count` and `count` is greater than 1, `j` is at least 2.
- The character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, and also not equal to `x`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string split at the character at index `j - 1`.

Output: **string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:] (where `j` is the value of `count` and `count` is greater than 1)**
