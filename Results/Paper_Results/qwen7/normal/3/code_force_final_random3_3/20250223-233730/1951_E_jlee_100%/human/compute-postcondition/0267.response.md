Postcondition: `j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is greater than 0, the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, `count2` is either equal to `count` (if `count > 1` and `count2 == count`), 0 (if `count <= 1` and `count2 == count`), or greater than `count` (if `count2 > count` and `done` is set to `True`).
