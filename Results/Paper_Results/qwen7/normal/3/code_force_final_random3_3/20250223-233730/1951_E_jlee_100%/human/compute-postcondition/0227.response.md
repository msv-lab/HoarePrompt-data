Postcondition: **`j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is less than 1, and either the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, in which case `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to `x` and `count` is incremented by 1. We continue the loop or if statement.**
