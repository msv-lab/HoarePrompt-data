Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `n` is the length of the list `s`.
   - `done` is `True`.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - The current value of `s[j]` (which is `s[0]`) is not equal to `x`.
   - `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`.
   - `count2` is not equal to `count`.
   - `count2` is now greater than `count`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j], string[j:])
   ```

Given the initial state:
- Since `j` is 0, `string[:j]` is equivalent to `string[0:0]`, which is an empty string (`""`).
- `string[j:]` is equivalent to `string[0:]`, which means the entire string `string`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **"" string**
