Postcondition: `j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is greater than 0, the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, `count2` is equal to `count`, and either `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `count2` is reset to 0.
