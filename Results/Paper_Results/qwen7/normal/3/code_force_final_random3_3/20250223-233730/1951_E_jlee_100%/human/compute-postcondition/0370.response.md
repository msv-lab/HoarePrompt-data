Output: **NO**

Explanation: The `print('NO')` statement directly prints the string 'NO'. According to the initial state, `done` is `False`, and the condition `(not done)` is true, which means the code block leading up to the print statement would have been executed. Since no other variables or conditions affect the print statement itself, it simply outputs 'NO'.
