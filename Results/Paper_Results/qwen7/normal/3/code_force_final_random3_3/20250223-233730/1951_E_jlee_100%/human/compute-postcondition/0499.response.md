Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is `True`, and `count` is 0.**

The code `done = True` simply reassigns the variable `done` to `True`. Since the initial state already had `done` as `True`, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables (`j`, `n`, and `count`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
