Output State: **`j` is 1; `n` is the length of the list `s`; `done` is `True`; `count` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `j`, `n`, `done`, or `count`, their values remain unchanged.
