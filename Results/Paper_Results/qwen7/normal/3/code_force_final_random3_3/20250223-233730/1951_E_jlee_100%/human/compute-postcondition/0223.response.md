Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is less than 1, the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to `x`, and either the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s` is not equal to `x` and `done` is True, or the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s` is equal to `x` and `done` remains False, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
