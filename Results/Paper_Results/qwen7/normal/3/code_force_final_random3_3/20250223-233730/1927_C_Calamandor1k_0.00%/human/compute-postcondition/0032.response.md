Postcondition: `count_a` is either 3 or 2, `count_b` is either 2 or 3, `max(len_a, len_b)` must be at least 1, `len_a` is greater than `i_new + 1` and the current value of `a[i_new]` is less than or equal to `k`, and `len_b` is greater than `i_new + 1` and the current value of `b[i_new]` is less than or equal to `k`. If the condition `a[i] <= k` is true, then `count_a` is incremented by 1. If the condition `len_b > i + 1` is true, then `count_b` is incremented by 1.
