Postcondition: `i` is 0, `len_a` is a non-negative integer, `len_b` is a non-negative integer, and max(`len_a`, `len_b`) is a positive integer, the length of `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, the length of `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, and either `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and `count_b` is 1, or `b[i]` is greater than `k`.
