Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`**.

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
