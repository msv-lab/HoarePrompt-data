Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the lengths of lists `a` and `b` and assigns these lengths to the variables `len_a` and `len_b`, respectively. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the lengths of these lists are now stored in `len_a` and `len_b`.
