Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from another input string split on spaces and converted to integers, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `count_a` and `count_b`, both set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
