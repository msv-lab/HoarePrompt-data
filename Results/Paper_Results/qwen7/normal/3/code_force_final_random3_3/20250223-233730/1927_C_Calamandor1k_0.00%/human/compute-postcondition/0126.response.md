Postcondition: `i` is an integer less than `max(len_a, len_b)`, `count_a` is `i` + 1, `count_b` remains unchanged unless `b[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `k` and `i + 1` is less than `len_b`. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` remains unchanged; otherwise, `count_a` remains unchanged.
