Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for determining the optimal moves for Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement.
2. The `func_1` function calculates the MEX of the array `c` based on the counts of integers in `a`, but it does not simulate the game play between Alice and Bob.
3. The logic in the function assumes that the MEX can be determined directly from the counts of integers without considering the turns of Alice and Bob.
4. The function should consider the turns of Alice and Bob to ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it.
5. The current implementation does not handle the alternating turns and the specific actions of Alice and Bob correctly.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly simulate the game and determine the optimal MEX based on the rules described.

Correctness: **False**
