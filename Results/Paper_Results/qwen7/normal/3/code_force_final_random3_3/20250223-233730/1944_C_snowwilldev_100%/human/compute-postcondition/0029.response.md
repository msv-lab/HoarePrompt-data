Postcondition: `t` is 4, `N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`. If the count of `i` in `a` is exactly 1, then `t` remains unchanged.
