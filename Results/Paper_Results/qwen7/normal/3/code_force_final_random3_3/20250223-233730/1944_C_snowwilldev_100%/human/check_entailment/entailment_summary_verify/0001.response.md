### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the problem and the logic implemented in the program. Let's break down the analysis step by step to ensure the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - A dictionary `cnt` is used to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - This is necessary to determine which numbers appear exactly once.

3. **Finding the Minimum Excludant (MEX):**
   - The function `func_1()` iterates through numbers from `0` to `N`.
   - It checks if the count of any number `i` is exactly `1`. If so, it increments `t`.
   - If `t` reaches `2` or if the count of any number `i` becomes `0`, it returns `i`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Objective:**
   - The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` formed by the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
   - Alice can choose elements freely, while Bob can only choose from remaining elements.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many unique numbers as possible in `c`.
   - Bob will remove elements to minimize the MEX.

3. **Algorithm Evaluation:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of each number in `a`.
   - It then iterates through numbers from `0` to `N` to find the smallest number that appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`).
   - If such a number is found, it returns it immediately.
   - If no such number is found, it returns `N`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If every number in `a` appears more than once, the MEX would be `N` (since all numbers from `0` to `N-1` are covered).
   - If there is at least one number that appears exactly once, the MEX would be that number.

### Detailed Verification:

- **Alice's Strategy:**
  - Alice can always pick a number that appears exactly once, ensuring that the MEX is maximized.
  - If Alice picks a number that appears exactly once, Bob cannot prevent it from being included in `c` since he can only pick from the remaining elements.

- **Bob's Strategy:**
  - Bob can only pick from the remaining elements, and his goal is to minimize the MEX.
  - If there are multiple numbers that appear exactly once, Bob can pick one of them, but Alice can still ensure that the MEX is maximized by picking another unique number.

- **Function Logic:**
  - The function correctly counts the occurrences of each number.
  - It iterates through the numbers and returns the smallest number that appears exactly once.
  - If no such number is found, it returns `N`, which is the correct MEX if all numbers appear more than once.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` under the optimal play of both players. It handles the counting and finding the smallest unique number efficiently.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided function summary.
