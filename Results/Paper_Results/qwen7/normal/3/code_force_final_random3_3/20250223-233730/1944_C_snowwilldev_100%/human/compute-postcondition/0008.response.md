Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `N` is a positive integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `i` by 1, making `i` equal to `i + 1`. It also increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged.
