You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():

    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):

    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:

- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is less than n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `N` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `cnt` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the list `a` as a key, and the value associated with each key will be the total count of occurrences of that integer in the list `a`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: t is 4, N is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Alice can choose any element from the array `a` on her turn, whereas Bob can only choose elements that are still present in `a`. The current implementation of `func_1` simply counts the occurrences of each number in the array and returns the smallest number that appears exactly once or is missing from the count. This approach does not reflect the strategic nature of the game where Alice and Bob make optimal choices.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
1
```

This happens because the program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it just counts the occurrences of each number and returns the smallest number that is either unique or missing. In the given example, the program incorrectly assumes that Bob will always pick the smallest available number, leading to an incorrect MEX value.

A correct solution would involve simulating the turns of Alice and Bob to ensure that the game is played optimally according to the rules.
