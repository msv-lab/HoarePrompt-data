Output State: **`t` is 1, `N` must be a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`. The current value of `cnt[i]` is 1.**

The value of `t` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The values of `N`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states.
