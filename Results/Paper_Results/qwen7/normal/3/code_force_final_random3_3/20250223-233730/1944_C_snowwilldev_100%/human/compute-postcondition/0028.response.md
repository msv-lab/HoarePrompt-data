Output State: **`t` is 4, `N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `N`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
