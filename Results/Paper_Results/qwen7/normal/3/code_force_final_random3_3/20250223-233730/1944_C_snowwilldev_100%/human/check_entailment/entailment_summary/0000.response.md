Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the game's final score based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
- Alice's strategy involves picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c`, while Bob removes elements directly from `a`.
- The goal is to calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c` after both players have played optimally.
- The provided code does not correctly simulate the game's process as described. Instead, it attempts to find a specific value based on the count of elements in `a`.

Let's analyze the provided code:
1. The function `func_1()` takes no arguments but relies on external inputs.
2. It counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a `defaultdict`.
3. It then iterates through the possible values in `a` and checks conditions to return a value.
4. The logic in the loop seems to be incorrect for simulating the game and calculating the MEX.

Given the execution summary, the code does not accurately reflect the game's rules or the objective of finding the MEX of `c` after both players have played optimally. Therefore, the provided code is not correct for solving the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
