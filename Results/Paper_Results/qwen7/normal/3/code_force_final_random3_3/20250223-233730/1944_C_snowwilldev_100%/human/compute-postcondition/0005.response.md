Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < N`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `N` must be a positive integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0.
   - `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the loop variable, it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < N`, so `N` remains unchanged.
   - The other variables (`t`, `a`, `cnt`) remain the same unless explicitly stated otherwise within the loop body, but since no such changes are mentioned, they stay as they are.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains the same (still a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^4\)).
   - `N` remains the same (still a positive integer).
   - `a` remains the same (still a list of integers).
   - `cnt` remains the same (still a defaultdict with default value 0), but `cnt[a[i]]` will be incremented if `i < N`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and `i` is incremented by 1 to become `i + 1`**.
