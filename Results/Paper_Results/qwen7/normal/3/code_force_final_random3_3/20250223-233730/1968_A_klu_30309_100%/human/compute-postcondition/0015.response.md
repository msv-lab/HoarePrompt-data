Output State: **`max_sum` retains its original value, `best_y` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y-1`, `current_sum` retains its original value, `y` is `y - 1**.

This means that the `gcd_val` variable now holds the greatest common divisor of the original `x` and the new value of `y` (which is `y - 1`). All other variables retain their original values from the initial state.
