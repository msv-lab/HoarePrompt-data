Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `y` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `max_sum` is 0.
   - `best_y` is 1.
   - `results` list is appended with 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `y` in the range from `x - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - For the loop to start, `x` must be greater than 1 because the range starts from `x - 1` and goes down to 0.
   - The variable `y` will take values starting from `x - 1` and decreasing until it reaches 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start, which means `x` must be greater than 1.
   - The initial value of `y` will be `x - 1`, but since we are only concerned with the starting state, we don't need to specify this explicitly unless it affects the loop's execution directly.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `y` (though `y` is not explicitly stated in the initial state, its starting value depends on `x`).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `results` list is appended with 1, `x` must be greater than 1**
