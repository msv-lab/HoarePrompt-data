Output State: **`max_sum` retains its original value, `best_y` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y-1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (y - 1), `y` is `y - 1**.

Explanation: The code updates `current_sum` to be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y - 1`. The other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, and `gcd_val`) retain their original values. The value of `y` is updated to `y - 1`.
