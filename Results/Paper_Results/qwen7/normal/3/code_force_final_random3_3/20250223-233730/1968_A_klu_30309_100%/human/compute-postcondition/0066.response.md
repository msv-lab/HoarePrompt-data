Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, the `results` list now contains 1, `gcd_val` is unchanged, `x` is the next value from `test_cases` (a positive integer), `y` is `x - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y**.

Explanation: The code calculates `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`. Since `y` is `x - 1`, `current_sum` becomes `gcd_val + (x - 1)`. The other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, `results`, and `gcd_val`) remain unchanged.
