Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is now equal to `y`, `results` list contains 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the program will exit the current loop or conditional structure. The values of `max_sum`, `best_y`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged, and the `results` list still contains the value 1.
