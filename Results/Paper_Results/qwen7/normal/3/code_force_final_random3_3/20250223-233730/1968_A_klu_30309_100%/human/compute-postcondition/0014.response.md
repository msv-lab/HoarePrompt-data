Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):`. The variables involved here are `y` and the range parameters derived from `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `y` is in the range from `x - 1` to `1` (inclusive). This means `y` starts at `x - 1` and decrements until it reaches `1`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` retain their original properties.
   - If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is updated to `x - 1`, and the loop breaks.

4. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `y` is in the specified range, the next value of `y` will be `y - 1`.
   - The other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum`) remain unchanged unless the condition inside the loop is met.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `y` will be decreased by 1 from its current value.
- All other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`max_sum` retains its original value, `best_y` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `gcd_val` retains its original value, `current_sum` retains its original value, `y` is `y - 1`**.
