Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is now equal to `y`, `results` list contains 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y` and it is greater than `max_sum`.**

Explanation: The code `best_y = y` assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
