Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 1`, the `results` list now contains 1, `gcd_val` remains unchanged, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`, `y` is `x - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y**.

This means that `max_sum` has been updated to be equal to `current_sum`, while all other variables remain in their previous states.
