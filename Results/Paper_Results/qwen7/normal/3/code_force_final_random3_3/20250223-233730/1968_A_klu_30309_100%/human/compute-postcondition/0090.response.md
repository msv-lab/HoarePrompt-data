Output State: **`max_sum` will hold the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during all iterations of the loop, `best_y` will be the corresponding `y` value that produced this maximum sum, the `results` list will remain unchanged at `[1]`, `gcd_val` is the GCD of the last `x` and `best_y` found, and `results.append(best_y)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `best_y` to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially `[1]`, after appending `best_y`, `results` becomes `[1, best_y]`. All other variables retain their previous states: `max_sum` holds the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the iterations, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value, `gcd_val` is the GCD of the last `x` and `best_y`, and `x` has been processed to its last value in `test_cases`.
