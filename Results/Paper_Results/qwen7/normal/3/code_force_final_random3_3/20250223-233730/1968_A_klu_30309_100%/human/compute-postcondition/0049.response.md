Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y`, `results` list still contains 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `y` is `y - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y**.

Explanation: The line `best_y = y` updates the value of `best_y` to be the current value of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
