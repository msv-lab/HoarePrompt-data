Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to determine the minimum penalty is flawed. The program attempts to find a way to split the array into two subsequences such that the total number of increasing pairs in both subsequences is minimized. However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly handle the splitting process.

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output is `3`, but the program outputs `0`. This happens because the program tries to minimize the penalty by always assigning the next element to the subsequence that has the smallest current value, which does not necessarily lead to the optimal split.

A correct approach would involve sorting the array and then finding the longest decreasing subsequence, as this would help in minimizing the penalty. The given solution does not account for this and thus fails to provide the correct minimum penalty for various test cases.
