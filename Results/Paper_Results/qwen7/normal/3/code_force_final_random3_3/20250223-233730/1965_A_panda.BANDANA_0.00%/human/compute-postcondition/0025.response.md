Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`, `n` is the integer entered by the user after splitting and converting the input string, `m` is the length of the list `l`.**

The code `m = len(l)` calculates the length of the list `l` and assigns it to the variable `m`. Since `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, the value of `m` is the number of elements in `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
