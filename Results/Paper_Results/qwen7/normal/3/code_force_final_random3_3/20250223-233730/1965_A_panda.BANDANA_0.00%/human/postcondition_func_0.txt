The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer t and a list of n integers. For each test case, it checks if the number 1 is present in the list. If 1 is found in any list, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return a value but prints the result for each test case.
