Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers. It handles multiple test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), with the sum of n not exceeding 2⋅10^5. For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t and the list a.**
