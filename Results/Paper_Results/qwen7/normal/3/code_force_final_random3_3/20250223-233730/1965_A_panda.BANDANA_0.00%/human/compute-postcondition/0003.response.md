Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `l`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and `n` remains an input integer, though its specific value is not known without further input.
