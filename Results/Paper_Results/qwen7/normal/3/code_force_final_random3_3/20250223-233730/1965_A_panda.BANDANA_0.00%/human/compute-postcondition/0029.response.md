Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` equals `t`, `n` is the last input integer entered by the user after splitting and converting the input string, `l` is the last list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is the set containing unique elements from the last list `l`, and `m` is the length of the last list `l`. The final output will be either 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on whether the number 1 is present in the last list `l`.
