Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`, and `l` is updated to a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `l`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `e`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
