Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `arr`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
