Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, and `flag` is False**

Explanation: The line `flag = False` does not change any of the existing values of the variables. It only updates the value of `flag` to `False`. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
