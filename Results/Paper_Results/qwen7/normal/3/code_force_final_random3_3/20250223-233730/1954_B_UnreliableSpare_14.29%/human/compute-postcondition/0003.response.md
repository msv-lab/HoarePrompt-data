Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be initialized to 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Check the given initial states**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `flag` is True.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `i` should be set to 1.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 1 and `n` to be greater than 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
