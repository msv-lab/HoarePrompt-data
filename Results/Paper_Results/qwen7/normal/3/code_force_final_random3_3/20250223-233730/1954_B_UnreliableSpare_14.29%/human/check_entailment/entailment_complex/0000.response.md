Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it fails to accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
2. The program incorrectly assumes that if the array is not monotonous (i.e., there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements that are not equal), it should print -1. This is incorrect because the problem allows for removing elements to break the beauty condition, which may not require making the array monotonous.
3. The program also incorrectly handles the case where the array is already monotonous. For a monotonous array, the correct output should be -1, but the program prints 0, which is incorrect.
4. The logic to calculate the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program does not correctly identify the segments of the array that need to be removed to break the beauty condition.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
