### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed to make it non-beautiful.
   - If the array is not uniform, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure the array cannot be made uniform again.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The program uses a flag to check if the array is uniform. This is done correctly.
   - If the array is uniform, the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - If the array is not uniform, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove by counting the occurrences of the first element (`val`) and finding the minimum count of consecutive occurrences (`cnt`). This logic is flawed because it doesn't account for the condition required to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The program should identify the longest sequence of consecutive elements that can be removed to break the beauty condition. However, the current logic only considers the count of the first element.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest sequence of consecutive elements that can be removed to break the beauty condition.
   - We should iterate through the array and keep track of the longest sequence of consecutive elements that can be removed.

5. **Reviewing the Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code shows that the program does not correctly handle the logic for identifying the minimum number of elements to remove.
   - Specifically, the logic for calculating `ans` only considers the count of the first element, which is insufficient.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers the count of the first element, which is insufficient.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the final evaluation is **False**.
