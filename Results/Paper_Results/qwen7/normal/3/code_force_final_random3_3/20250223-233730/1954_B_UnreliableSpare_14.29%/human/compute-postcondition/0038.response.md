Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is the minimum value between its current value and `cnt + 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is incremented by 1 before this line, `cnt` becomes `cnt + 1`. The other variables (`arr`, `ans`, `cnt`, and `i`) are updated accordingly.
