Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each iteration, `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each element in `arr`, and `i` is equal to `n` (the length of `arr`). Whether `flag` is True or False, the final state of `ans`, `cnt`, and `i` remains consistent with the initial conditions and the operations performed within the if-else block.
