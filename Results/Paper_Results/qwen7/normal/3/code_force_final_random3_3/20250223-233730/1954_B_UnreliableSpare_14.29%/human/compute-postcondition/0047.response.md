Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each iteration.
- `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each element in `arr`.
- `i` is equal to `n` (the length of `arr`).
- `flag` is False.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process:

1. `cnt` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 for each element in `arr`. Therefore, after processing all elements in `arr`, `cnt` will be equal to the length of `arr` (`n`).

2. `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each iteration. Since `cnt` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 for each element, the minimum value `ans` can take is 0, assuming `ans` is initialized to a value greater than or equal to 0.

Given these points, the final value of `ans` will be 0 because it will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, and `cnt` will eventually reach the length of `arr`, making the minimum value 0.

Therefore, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be:

Output: **0**
