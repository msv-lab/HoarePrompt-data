Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`.
   - `flag` remains False since no break occurs in the if condition.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` is now 2).

4. **Maintain other states**: The conditions involving `arr[i]` and `flag` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop itself but by the loop body, which is omitted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, and `flag` remains False since no break occurs in the if condition**.
