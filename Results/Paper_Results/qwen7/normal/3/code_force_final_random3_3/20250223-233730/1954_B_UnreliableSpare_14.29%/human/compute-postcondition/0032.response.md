Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and there exists an index `i` such that either `arr[i]` equals `val` (in which case `cnt` is incremented by 1) or `arr[i]` does not equal `val`, where `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
