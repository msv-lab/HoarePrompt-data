Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to account for the possibility of removing elements to break the beauty condition when the array has alternating or mixed patterns.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
6
1 2 1 2 1 2
4
3 3 4 3
8
3 3 3 5 3 3 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
2
3
```

However, the current implementation will output:
```
1
-1
3
```

The issue arises because the program only checks if the array is already in a state where it cannot be made beautiful by removing elements. It does not consider the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing elements in a way that disrupts the pattern.

For example, in the third test case `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the program incorrectly outputs `3` because it only considers the initial state and does not explore the possibility of removing elements to break the beauty condition. The correct approach would involve checking all possible ways to remove elements to see if the array can be made non-beautiful.
