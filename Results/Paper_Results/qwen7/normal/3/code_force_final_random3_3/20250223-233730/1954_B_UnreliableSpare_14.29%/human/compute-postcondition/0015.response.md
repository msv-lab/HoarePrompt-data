Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`
   - `flag` remains False since no break occurs in the if condition

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < n`. Since `n` must be greater than 2, the loop can continue as long as `i` is within the range `[1, n)`.

4. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be 3 (incremented from 2)
   - `n` must still be greater than 3 (since `i` must be less than `n`)
   - `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]` (this condition will be checked when `i` is 3, i.e., `arr[3]` should not be equal to `arr[2]`)
   - `flag` remains False (since no break occurs in the if condition)

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, and `flag` remains False**
