The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It first checks if the array \( a \) is monotonous (i.e., all elements are the same). If the array is not monotonous, it calculates the minimum number of changes required to make the array monotonous. If the array is monotonous, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the calculated minimum number of changes.
