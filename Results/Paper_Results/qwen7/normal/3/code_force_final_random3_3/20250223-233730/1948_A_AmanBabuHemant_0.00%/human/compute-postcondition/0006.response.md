Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `n` is even; `s` is '110110...110' (repeated `n//2` times)**

Explanation: The string `s` is assigned the value `'110'` repeated `(n // 2)` times. Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will be a positive integer. The conditions that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` is an even integer remain unchanged.
