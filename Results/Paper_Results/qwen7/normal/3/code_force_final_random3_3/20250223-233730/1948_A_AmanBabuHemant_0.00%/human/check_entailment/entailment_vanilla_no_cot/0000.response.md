Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Special Character Definition**: The program checks for special characters using a pattern '110', which does not accurately represent the definition of a special character given in the problem statement. A special character should be equal to exactly one of its neighbors, but '110' does not meet this criterion.

2. **Pattern Generation**: The pattern '110' is used to generate the string, which does not ensure that each character is special according to the problem's definition. For example, 'AAABAACC' from the example in the problem statement is correct, but the generated strings do not follow the same logic.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle all edge cases correctly. For instance, when `n` is odd, it prints 'NO', which is correct, but it does not generate a valid string for even `n`.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to generate a string where each character is special. One way to achieve this is by alternating characters in a specific pattern. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Generate a string with alternating characters
            s = 'AB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) <= 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This version correctly generates a string where each character is special and meets the problem requirements.
