Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters. According to the problem description, a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. However, the current implementation generates strings like "110" repeated `(n // 2)` times, which does not guarantee that each character will be special. For example, if `n = 4`, the generated string would be "110110", which has only 2 special characters (positions 2 and 4). This does not satisfy the requirement that each character should be special. Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem requirements for certain values of `n`.
