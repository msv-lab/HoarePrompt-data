Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, and if `n` is odd, `n` remains odd. If `n` is even, `n` remains even, and `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times, with the length of `s` being either less than 200 or 200 or more; `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The conditions about `t` and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to the integer input by the user.
