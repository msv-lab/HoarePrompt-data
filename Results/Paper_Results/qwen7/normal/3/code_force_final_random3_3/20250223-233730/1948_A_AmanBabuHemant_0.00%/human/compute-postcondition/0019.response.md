Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an integer, and it remains odd if it is odd and even if it is even (though `n` is not used in the print statement).
- `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times. The length of `s` is either less than 200 or 200 or more, but this information is also not needed for the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
