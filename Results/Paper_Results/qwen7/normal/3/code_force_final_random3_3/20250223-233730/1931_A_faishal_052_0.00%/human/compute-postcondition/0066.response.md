Output State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is [26], `lex` is an input integer greater than 10 and less than 26, `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code subtracts 26 from `lex`. Given that `lex` was originally an integer greater than 26 and less than 52, after subtracting 26, `lex` will now be an integer greater than 10 and less than 26. All other variables remain unchanged.
