Output State: **`j` is 2; `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value; `arr` contains the elements [26, 1]**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contained the element `26`. After appending `1` to `arr`, the list now contains `[26, 1]`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
