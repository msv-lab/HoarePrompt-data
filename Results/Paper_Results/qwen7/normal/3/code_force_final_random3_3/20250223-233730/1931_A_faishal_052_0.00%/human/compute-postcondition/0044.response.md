Output State: **`arr` is [1, 13, 26]**.

The `sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Initially, `arr` is `[1, 26, 26]`. After sorting, the list becomes `[1, 13, 26]`. Note that `26` is halved to `13` because `26 / 2 = 13`. The output state reflects the sorted list with the updated value of `13` replacing one of the original `26`s.
