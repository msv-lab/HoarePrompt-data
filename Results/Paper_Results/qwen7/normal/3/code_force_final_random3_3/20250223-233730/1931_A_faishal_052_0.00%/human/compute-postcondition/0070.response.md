Output State: **`k` is 2; `arr` is a list containing 26; `lex` is an input integer equal to `lex - 26` and greater than or equal to 26; `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 26, making it an integer that is now equal to its original value minus 26. The other variables (`k`, `arr`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
