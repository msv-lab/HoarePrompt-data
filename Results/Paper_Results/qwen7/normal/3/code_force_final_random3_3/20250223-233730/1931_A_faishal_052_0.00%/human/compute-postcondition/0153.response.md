Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `k` is explicitly given as 0.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `chr()` function returns a string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer passed to it.
   - The expression inside `chr()` is `arr[k] + 96`.
   - Since `k` is 0, `arr[k]` is `arr[0]`.

4. **Determine `arr[0]`**:
   - The problem does not provide the explicit value of `arr[0]`, but since it is a list and no other information about the list is given, we cannot determine the exact value of `arr[0]`.
   - Therefore, we need to express the output in terms of `arr[0]`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The expression `arr[0] + 96` will give us the Unicode code point, and `chr()` will convert this to the corresponding character.
   - The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function means that there will be no newline after the printed character.

Given the above steps, the output will be the character corresponding to the Unicode code point of `arr[0] + 96`.

Output: **chr(arr[0] + 96)**
