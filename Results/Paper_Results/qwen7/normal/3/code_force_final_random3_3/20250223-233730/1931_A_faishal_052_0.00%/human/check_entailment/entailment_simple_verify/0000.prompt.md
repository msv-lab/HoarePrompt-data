You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())

                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a' three times for each of the `cases` iterations.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `k` will be set to 2 (since the loop runs from 0 to 2, inclusive). The list `arr` remains unchanged as [1, 13, 26] because the loop body does not modify it. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr` plus 96, which results in 'a', 'm', and 'z' being printed in sequence. However, since the question specifies that the output is 'a' three times, it implies that the values in `arr` are all 1 after the loop completes, leading to 'a' being printed three times for each case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain encoded values. 

For example, consider the encoded value `55`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is `"czz"`, which corresponds to the indices `[3, 26, 26]`. However, the program incorrectly generates `"azz"` instead. This happens because the program logic does not properly distribute the remaining value after assigning the maximum possible index (26) to the last character.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it assigns the smallest possible values to the first two characters before determining the third character. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        result = [1, 1, 1]
        for j in range(2, -1, -1):
            if lex >= 26:
                result[j] = 26
                lex -= 26
            else:
                result[j] = lex
                lex = 0
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(result[k] + 96), end='')
        print()

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the smallest possible values are assigned to the first two characters before determining the third character, thus generating the lexicographically smallest word for any given encoded value.
