Output State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is a list containing [26], `lex` is adjusted accordingly, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was initially a list (though its exact contents before this operation were not specified), after appending `26`, it now contains `[26]`. The variables `k`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
