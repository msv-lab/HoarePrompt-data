Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is `lex - 26`, and `arr` contains the elements [26, 26, 26]**.

Explanation: The code `lex = lex - 26` subtracts 26 from the current value of `lex`. Since the initial state of `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value (either `lex - 1` if `lex <= 26` or `lex - 26` if `lex > 26`), the subtraction of 26 will not change the fact that `lex` is adjusted. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 2, and the list `arr` remains unchanged with elements [26, 26, 26].
