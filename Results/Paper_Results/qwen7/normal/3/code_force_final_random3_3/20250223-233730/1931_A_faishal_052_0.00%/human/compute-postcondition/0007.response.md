Output State: **`lex` is an integer less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing the value 1.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the list `arr`. Since `lex` is not affected by this operation, its value remains unchanged. The output state includes the updated list `arr` which now contains the value `1`.
