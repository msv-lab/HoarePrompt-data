Output State: **`lex` is an integer greater than 26 and greater than or equal to 52; `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Since `lex` was initially an integer greater than 26 and greater than or equal to 52, its value remains unchanged. The list `arr` now contains the element 26.
