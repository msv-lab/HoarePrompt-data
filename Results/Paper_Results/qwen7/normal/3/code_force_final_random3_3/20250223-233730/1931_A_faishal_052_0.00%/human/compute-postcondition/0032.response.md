Output State: **`lex` is an integer and `arr` contains the elements [1, 1]**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the value `1`. If `lex` is between 26 and 52, `arr` contains the elements `[1, 26]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` remains unchanged and still contains the elements `[1, 26]`. In all cases, after appending `1` to `arr`, the list `arr` will contain `[1, 1]`.
