Output State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is a list containing 26, `lex` is adjusted according to the condition, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. The other variables (`k`, `lex`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
