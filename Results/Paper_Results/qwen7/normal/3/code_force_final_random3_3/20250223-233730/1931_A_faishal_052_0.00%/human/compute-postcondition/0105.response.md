Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `k` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `arr` is a sorted list with the last element being 0. Since it's sorted and the last element is 0, the list must look something like `[a, b, c, 0]` where `c` is the third-to-last element, and `b` is the second-to-last element, and `a` is the first element.
   - `lex` is explicitly given as 0.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet is `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.
   - We need to determine the value of `arr[k]`. Since `k` is 3, we are accessing the fourth element of the list `arr`.
   - From the initial state, we know the last element of `arr` is 0. Therefore, `arr[3]` (which is `arr[k]`) is 0.
   - Now, we need to calculate `chr(arr[k] + 96)`, which is `chr(0 + 96) = chr(96)`.
   - The character corresponding to ASCII value 96 is `(`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the character `(`.

Output: **(**
