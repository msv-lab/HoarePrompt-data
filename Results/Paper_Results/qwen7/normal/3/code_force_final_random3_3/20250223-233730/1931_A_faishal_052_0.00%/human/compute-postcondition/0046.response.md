Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list containing the elements `[1, 13, 26]`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `k` must be less than 3, which is true since `k = 0`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Execution**:
   - First, the expression inside the `chr` function is evaluated: `arr[k] + 96`.
     - Since `k` is 0, `arr[k]` is `arr[0]`, which is `1`.
     - Therefore, `arr[0] + 96` is `1 + 96`, resulting in `97`.
   - Next, `chr(97)` is called, which returns the character corresponding to the ASCII value 97. The ASCII value 97 corresponds to the letter 'a'.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the character 'a' with no newline (`end=''`).

Output: **a**
