Output State: **`arr` is [1, 26, 26]**.

Given the initial state where the loop will execute exactly 3 times and the conditions specified for `arr` based on the value of `lex`, the code snippet `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Since the loop has already executed 3 times and `arr` contains `[1, 26, 26]` when `lex` is between 27 and 51, no further changes occur to `arr`. Therefore, the final state of `arr` remains `[1, 26, 26]`.
