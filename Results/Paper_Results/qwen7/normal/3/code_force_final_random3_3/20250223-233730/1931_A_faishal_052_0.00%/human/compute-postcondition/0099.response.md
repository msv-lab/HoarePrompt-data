Output State: **`k` is 2; `arr` is a sorted list with the last element being 0; `lex` is 0**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Since the last element of `arr` was initially 0, after sorting, the last element remains 0. The values of `k` and `lex` are not affected by this operation.
