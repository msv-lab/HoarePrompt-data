Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for k in range(3)`. The variables involved here are `k`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `arr` is [1, 13, 26]
   - `k` is 0
   - `k` must be less than 3

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than 3.

4. **Determine the next value of `k`**: Since `k` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be 1.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: With `k` being 1 (which is still less than 3), the loop will continue to execute.

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the state to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop. The only variable that changes is `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`arr` is [1, 13, 26], `k` is 1, `k` must be less than 3**
