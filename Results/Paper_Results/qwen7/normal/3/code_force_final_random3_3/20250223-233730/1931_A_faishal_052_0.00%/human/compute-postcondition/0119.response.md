Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is less than 26 and less than 52; `arr` contains the element 26; `lex` is now equal to `lex - 26`.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was initially greater than 26 and less than 52, after subtracting 26, `lex` will be between 0 and 26 (exclusive). The other variables remain unchanged.
