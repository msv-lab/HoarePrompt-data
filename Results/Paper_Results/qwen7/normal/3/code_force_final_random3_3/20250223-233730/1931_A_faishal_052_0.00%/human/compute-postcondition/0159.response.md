Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a' three times.

Explanation: Given the loop runs for 3 iterations as per the provided output states, the variable `k` will be set to 2 after the last iteration. Since the loop prints `chr(arr[k] + 96)` for each iteration with `k` ranging from 0 to 2, it will print the character corresponding to the value of `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` plus 96, which corresponds to the characters 'a', 'a', and 'a' respectively (assuming `arr` is structured such that `arr[0]` to `arr[2]` are all 1, leading to 'a' being printed three times).
