Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `k` in the range function `range(3)`. This means the loop will iterate over the values 0, 1, and 2.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as `k` is 0. This means that the loop has just started or it has completed its first iteration.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The condition for the loop to continue is that `k` must be less than 3. Since `k` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `k` is less than 3.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented from 0 to 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be 1.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`k` is 1**
