Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is a value between 26 and 52 (inclusive); `arr` contains the element 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26, making it a value between 26 and 52 (inclusive) since it was originally greater than 26 and greater than or equal to 52. The values of `j` and the contents of `arr` remain unchanged.
