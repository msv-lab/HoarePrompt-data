Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list containing the elements `[1, 13, 26]`.
   - `k` is set to `1`.
   - It is mentioned that `k` must be less than `3`, which is true since `k = 1`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Execution**:
   - First, the code accesses the element at index `k` in the list `arr`. Since `k = 1`, it accesses `arr[1]`.
   - The value of `arr[1]` is `13`.
   - Next, the code adds `96` to this value: `13 + 96 = 109`.
   - Finally, the `chr()` function converts the integer `109` to its corresponding character. The ASCII value `109` corresponds to the character `'m'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the character `'m'`.

Output: **m**
