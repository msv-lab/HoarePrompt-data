Output State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is a list containing 53 elements where the last element is 0, `lex` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` (which is 0) to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains up to 52 elements. After appending, `arr` will contain 53 elements, with the last element being 0. The values of `k` and `lex` remain unchanged.
