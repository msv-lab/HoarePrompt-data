Output State: **`lex` is an integer and `arr` contains the elements [1, 26, 26]**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. Depending on the initial value of `lex`, the list `arr` was initially either `[1]`, `[1, 26]`, or remained `[1, 26]`. In all cases, after appending `26`, the list `arr` now contains the elements `[1, 26, 26]`. The value of `lex` remains unchanged.
