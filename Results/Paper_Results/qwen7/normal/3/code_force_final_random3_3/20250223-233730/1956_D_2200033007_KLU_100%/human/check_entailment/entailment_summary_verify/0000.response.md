### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations, where each operation sets a segment of the array to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that segment. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the set.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function seems to be a recursive function that calculates the maximum possible sum of a subarray using a divide-and-conquer approach.
   - It computes the maximum sum of subarrays by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.
   - However, this function does not directly relate to the MEX operation or the problem's requirement to maximize the sum by setting segments to MEX values.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is supposed to find the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It uses the result from `func_1` to determine the optimal segments to set to MEX values.
   - However, the logic within `func_2` does not correctly identify the segments to set to MEX values. It appears to be trying to partition the array into subarrays and calculate their sums, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

3. **Function `make_stairs`:**
   - This function is intended to create a "stair" pattern in the array, setting all elements in a segment to the value of `i`.
   - However, the function is not used in the main logic of `func_2`, and its implementation does not align with the problem's requirements.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The provided functions do not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. They do not follow the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations.
- The problem requires finding the maximum sum of the array elements by performing operations that set a segment of the array to the MEX of that segment. However, the provided functions do not address this requirement. Instead, they attempt to partition the array into subarrays and calculate their sums, which is not the correct approach.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
This means we should set the segment `[3, 3]` to 2 and then set the segment `[3, 4]` to 2, resulting in the array `[1, 100, 2, 2]`, giving a sum of 105.

However, the provided program does not produce the correct output. The program does not correctly identify segments to set to the MEX value, and it does not maximize the sum of the array elements as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
