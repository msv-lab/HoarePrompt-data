### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

#### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing operations that set a segment of the array to the MEX of that segment. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set.

#### Function Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function computes the maximum sum of elements in a subarray `[start_index, end_index]` using a recursive approach.
   - It uses memoization (`res_dict`) to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The function calculates the maximum sum by considering different ways to split the subarray and recursively solving smaller subproblems.
   - However, the function does not ensure that the segments are set to the MEX values, which is a critical part of the problem.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function determines the optimal operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It uses the results from `func_1` to find the best way to partition the array.
   - The function constructs the sequence of operations by recursively finding the best splits and applying them.
   - Similar to `func_1`, this function does not explicitly set segments to MEX values.

3. **Function `make_stairs`:**
   - This function is used to set a segment of the array to a specific value (the MEX).
   - However, the function is not called within the main logic of `func_2`, and it seems to be a helper function for constructing stair-like patterns in the array.
   - The function does not directly contribute to the solution of the problem as described.

#### Key Issues:
- **Incorrect Approach:** The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not follow the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations. They attempt to partition the array and calculate sums, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
- **Lack of MEX Operations:** The program does not explicitly set segments of the array to the MEX values, which is crucial for maximizing the sum.
- **Incomplete Solution:** The functions do not provide a sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum, and they do not handle the problem constraints effectively.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
This output indicates that the elements from index 3 to 4 are set to 2, resulting in the array `[1, 100, 2, 2]` with a sum of 105. However, the provided program does not produce this output, indicating that it does not correctly implement the solution.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It attempts to partition the array and calculate sums, but it does not set segments to the MEX values as required. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
