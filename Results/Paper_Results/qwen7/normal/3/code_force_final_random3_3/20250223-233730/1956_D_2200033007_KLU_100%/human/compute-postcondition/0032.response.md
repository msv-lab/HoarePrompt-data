Output State: **`is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` is 2, `i` is decreased by 1, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, `arr[start_index + 0]`, `arr[start_index + 1]`, and `arr[start_index + 2]` are not equal to 0, 1, and 2 respectively, and `i` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to the list `res`. The value of `i` is decreased by 1, but its exact new value is not specified. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
