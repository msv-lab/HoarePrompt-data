### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not solve the problem as intended. Let's break down why the original assessment is accurate:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function attempts to find the maximum possible sum of a subarray by partitioning it into smaller subarrays and recursively computing the maximum sums.
   - However, it does not consider the MEX operation, which is crucial for determining the optimal value to set the subarray to.
   - The logic for partitioning the array is incorrect and does not account for the MEX value, leading to an incorrect solution.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is supposed to generate the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the maximum possible sum and then tries to find subarrays that contribute to this sum.
   - The logic for generating the operations is also incorrect. It does not correctly implement the MEX operation and the required logic to maximize the sum.
   - The approach of finding subarrays that contribute to the maximum sum without directly using the MEX operation is flawed.

3. **Function 3 (`make_stairs`)**:
   - This function is intended to fill the subarray to form a "staircase" pattern, but it is not used correctly in the context of the problem.
   - The function is called within `func_2`, but it does not correctly implement the MEX operation or the required logic to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The functions do not correctly implement the MEX operation and the logic to maximize the sum of the array. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
