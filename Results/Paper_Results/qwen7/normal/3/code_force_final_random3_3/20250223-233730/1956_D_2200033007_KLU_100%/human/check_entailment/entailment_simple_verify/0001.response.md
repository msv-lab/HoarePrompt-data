### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the MEX operation and the logic to maximize the sum of the array. Let's re-evaluate the code using the annotated version and the problem description to confirm this conclusion.

1. **Function 1: `func_1`**
   - The function aims to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - It uses recursion and memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
   - However, the logic inside the function does not directly account for the MEX operation. Instead, it attempts to partition the subarray in a way that maximizes the sum, which is not equivalent to the MEX operation.
   - For example, the line `res = (end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2` suggests a heuristic approach rather than a direct computation of the MEX value.

2. **Function 2: `func_2`**
   - This function is supposed to return the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the maximum possible sum.
   - If the maximum sum equals the square of the length of the subarray, it suggests a special case where the entire subarray can be filled with the same value.
   - Otherwise, it recursively finds the subarrays that contribute to the maximum sum.
   - The recursive calls and logic for finding the operations are also incorrect. They do not correctly implement the MEX operation.
   - For instance, the line `res.append((start_index, end_index))` suggests filling the entire subarray with a value, which is not necessarily the MEX value.

3. **Function 3: `make_stairs`**
   - This function is intended to fill the subarray to form a "staircase" pattern, but it is not used correctly in the context of the problem.
   - The function is called within `func_2`, but it does not correctly implement the MEX operation or the required logic to maximize the sum.
   - The logic inside `make_stairs` does not ensure that the subarray is filled with the correct MEX value.

### Detailed Evaluation

- **Problem Constraints**: The problem allows up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations, but the code does not correctly use these operations to maximize the sum.
- **MEX Operation**: The MEX operation is crucial for determining the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given set. The code does not correctly implement this operation.
- **Partitioning Logic**: The partitioning logic in `func_1` and `func_2` does not align with the MEX operation. Instead, it attempts to maximize the sum through heuristics rather than directly addressing the MEX requirement.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed evaluation, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the MEX operation and the logic to maximize the sum of the array.

**Final: False**
