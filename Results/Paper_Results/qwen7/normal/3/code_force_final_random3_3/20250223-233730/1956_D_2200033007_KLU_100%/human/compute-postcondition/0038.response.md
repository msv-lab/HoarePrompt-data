Output State: **`j` is 2; `i` is 1; `start_index` is 0; `arr[2]` is 1; `arr[2]` is now 1**

Explanation: The code `arr[j] = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the index `j` (which is 2) in the array `arr`. The other variables (`j`, `i`, `start_index`) remain unchanged, and the value at `arr[2]` is updated to 1.
