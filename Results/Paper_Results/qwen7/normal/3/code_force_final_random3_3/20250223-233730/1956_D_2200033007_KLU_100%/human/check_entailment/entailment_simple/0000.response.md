Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations that update a subarray to a single value (the MEX of the subarray). The operations are limited to 5 * 10^5.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(start_index, end_index)**: This function computes the maximum sum achievable by updating the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` to a single value. It uses a recursive approach to explore all possible ways to split the subarray and compute the MEX for each segment.
   - **func_2(start_index, end_index)**: This function returns the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`. It checks if the maximum sum is achieved by setting the entire subarray to a single value or by splitting the subarray into smaller segments.
   - **make_stairs(i)**: This function updates the subarray to achieve the MEX value for the segment, ensuring that the resulting array maximizes the sum.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The functions correctly handle the base cases and recursive splits.
   - The `func_2` function correctly identifies when to set the entire subarray to a single value and when to split it further.
   - The `make_stairs` function ensures that the subarray is updated to achieve the desired MEX value.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles arrays of different lengths and values correctly.
   - The recursive calls in `func_1` and `func_2` ensure that the solution space is explored thoroughly.
   - The `make_stairs` function ensures that the array is updated to achieve the maximum possible sum.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program logic is sound and correctly implements the problem requirements.
   - The constraints and operations are handled appropriately within the given limits.

Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem and adheres to the constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
