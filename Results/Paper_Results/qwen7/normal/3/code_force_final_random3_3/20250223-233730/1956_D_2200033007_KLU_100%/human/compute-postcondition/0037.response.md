Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` and the range function involving `start_index` and `start_index + i + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - `i` is 1
   - `start_index` is 0
   - `arr[2]` is 1 (and it is now 1)

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1`. Given `start_index` is 0 and `i` is 1, the loop runs from 0 to 1 (inclusive).

4. **Determine the value of `j` at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `start_index` (which is 0) and increments by 1 each time, the loop will run for `i + 1` times (in this case, 2 times).
   - After the first iteration, `j` is 1.
   - After the second iteration, `j` is 2.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < start_index + i + 1`.
   - After the second iteration, `j` is 2, and `start_index + i + 1` is also 2.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again because `j` is equal to `start_index + i + 1`.

6. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop does not execute again, no changes are needed for `j`, `i`, or `start_index`.
   - However, we need to ensure that the condition for the next iteration is met, but since the loop does not execute again, we don't need to change anything.

Given the above analysis, the final state remains the same as the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 2, `i` is 1, `start_index` is 0, `arr[2]` is 1**
