### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a tree with `n` nodes.
   - There are `t` rounds, but since `t = 1`, there is only one round.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an unvisited neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The goal is to determine the winner if both play optimally.

2. **Key Components:**
   - **Tree Representation:** The tree is represented using an adjacency list (`nodes`).
   - **Distance Calculation:** Function `func_1` calculates the distance from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - **Move Sequence:** Function `func_2` determines the sequence of moves from the starting node and checks if any move is odd.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - This function uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to calculate distances.
   - It correctly handles the case where the starting node has only one neighbor (itself), returning `[0]`.
   - For other nodes, it recursively calculates distances to all neighbors except the parent node.
   - The distances are collected in a list and returned.

4. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - Reads the tree structure and initializes the adjacency list.
   - Identifies leaf nodes (nodes with only one connection).
   - Determines the sequence of moves from the starting node using `func_1`.
   - Checks if any move in the sequence is odd. If so, prints "Ron"; otherwise, prints "Hermione".

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_2` is sound. It correctly identifies the sequence of moves and checks for odd moves.
   - The DFS approach in `func_1` accurately calculates the distances.
   - Given the constraints and the nature of the game, the logic aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Both functions work together to solve the problem as intended.
