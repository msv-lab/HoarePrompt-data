Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and `nodes` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors, `n` is updated to the integer value entered by the user, `t` is updated to the integer value entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. Since the initial values of `n` and `t` are specified within certain ranges, after the code executes, these ranges are updated to the specific values entered by the user. The other variables (`edges`, `start`, and `nodes`) remain unchanged.
