Postcondition: `moves` is the result of the function call `func_1(nodes, start)`, `leaves` list contains all keys from the `nodes` dictionary whose associated list has a length of exactly 1, `start` is an input integer. If there exists at least one move in `moves` that is an odd number, then this condition holds. Otherwise, every move in `moves` is even.
