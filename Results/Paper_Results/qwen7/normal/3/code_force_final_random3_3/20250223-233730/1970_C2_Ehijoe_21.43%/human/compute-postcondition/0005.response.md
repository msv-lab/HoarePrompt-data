Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**.

The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them, converting each to an integer before assigning them to `u` and `v`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
