Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary with at least one key, `key` is appended to `leaves`, `leaves` is a list containing the updated value of `key`, `next_key` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `key` to the list `leaves`. Since `key` is equal to `next_key`, `next_key` remains unchanged. The dictionary `nodes` and its contents remain unaffected.
