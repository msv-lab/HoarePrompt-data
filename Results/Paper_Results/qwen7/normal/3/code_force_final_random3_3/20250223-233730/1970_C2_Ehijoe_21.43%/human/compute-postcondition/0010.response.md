Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[u]` now contains `v` (assuming `nodes` is a list of lists where `nodes[u]` is updated to include `v`).**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list located at index `u` in the `nodes` list. Since `u` and `v` are input integers, their values remain unchanged. The `nodes` list is modified to include `v` at the position `u`. The values of `i` and `n` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
