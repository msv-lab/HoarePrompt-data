Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v].append(u)`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The only action taken is modifying the list `nodes[v]` by adding `u` to it.
