Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5), t (an integer equal to 1), edges (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), start (an integer between 1 and n), and nodes (a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors). The function returns a value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_2` takes several parameters related to a tree structure, including the number of nodes, edges, starting node, and the adjacency list representation of the tree. It then processes these inputs to determine and return a specific value based on the given conditions.
