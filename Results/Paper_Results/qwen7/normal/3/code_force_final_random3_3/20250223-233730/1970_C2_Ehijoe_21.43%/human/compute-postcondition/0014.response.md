Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[u]` contains `v`.**

The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Since `u` and `v` are input integers, their values remain unchanged. The variable `i` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated information about `nodes[u]`.
