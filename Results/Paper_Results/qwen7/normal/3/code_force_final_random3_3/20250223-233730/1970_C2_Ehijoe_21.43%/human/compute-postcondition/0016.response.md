Output State: The loop will execute `n-1` times, where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph. After all iterations, `i` will be `n-2`, `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers input by the user during the final iteration of the loop, and `nodes[v]` contains all the nodes that are directly connected to node `v`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, the variable `i` will be one less than `n` (i.e., `n-2`), meaning the loop has processed all but one of the required edges. The variable `n` will still be within the specified range. The variables `u` and `v` will hold the values of the last edge added to the graph. The `nodes` dictionary will represent an undirected graph where each node's value in `nodes` is a list of all its adjacent nodes.
