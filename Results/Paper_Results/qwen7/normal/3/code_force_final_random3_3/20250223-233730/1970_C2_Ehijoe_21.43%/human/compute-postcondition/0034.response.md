Output State: **`moves` is the result of the function call `func_1(nodes, start)`, `leaves` list contains all keys from the `nodes` dictionary whose associated list has a length of exactly 1, `start` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code defines `moves` by calling the function `func_1` with arguments `nodes` and `start`. The value of `start` remains unchanged, and the `leaves` list is not modified by this line of code. Therefore, the `leaves` list still contains all keys from the `nodes` dictionary whose associated list has a length of exactly 1, and `start` remains an input integer.
