Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`. Since `i` is currently 0, the condition `0 < n - 1` must hold true for the loop to execute again.

4. **Update the Values**:
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must remain within its original range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and the condition `i < n - 1` must still be satisfied. Since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 (which is already true since \(2 \leq n\)).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still satisfy \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)**
