Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of `s` and is currently '12', `m` is the minute part of `s` and is equal to `m1`, `h1` is '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is not equal to '23'.**

Explanation: The code `h1 = '12'` updates the value of `h1` to '12'. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
