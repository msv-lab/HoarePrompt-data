Postcondition: `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of `s`, `m` is the minute part of `s`, `h1` is either '06' or a value from '07' to '12' depending on the original value of `h`, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is set to 'PM' if `h` is '18', '21', '22', or '23', and 'AM' otherwise.
