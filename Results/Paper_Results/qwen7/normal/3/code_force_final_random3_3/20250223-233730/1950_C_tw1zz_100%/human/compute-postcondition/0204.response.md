Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the input split by ':', `m` is the minute part of the input split by ':', `h1` is '04', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'AM'.**

The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
