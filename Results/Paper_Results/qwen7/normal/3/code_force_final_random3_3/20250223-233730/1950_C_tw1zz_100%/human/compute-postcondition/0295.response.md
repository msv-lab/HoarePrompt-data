Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the input split by ':', `m` is the minute part of the input split by ':', `h1` is an empty string, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.**

Explanation: The code assigns an empty string to `h1` and keeps `m1` equal to `m`. The values of `s`, `t`, `h`, `m`, `time`, and the original values of `h1` and `m1` remain unchanged.
