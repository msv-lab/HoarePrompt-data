To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440.
   - `h` is the hour part of the input split by ':'.
   - `m` is the minute part of the input split by ':'.
   - `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', or '15'.
   - `m1` is equal to `m`.
   - `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

2. **Conditions for `h1`:**
   - If the hour part `h` is '01', then `h1` is set to '01' and `time` is set to 'AM'.
   - Otherwise, `h1` is set to one of '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', or '15', and `time` is set to either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')` will output the values of `h1`, `m`, and `time` with a colon between `h1` and `m`, and a space between `m` and `time`.

Since the exact values of `h`, `m`, and `t` are not provided, we need to consider the possible values for `h1` and `time` based on the conditions:

- If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is any other value from '02' to '12', then `h1` is one of '02', '03', ..., '12', and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

Therefore, the output will be in the format `h1:mm AM/PM`, where `h1` is either '01', '02', ..., '12', and `m` is the minute part of the input.

Output: **h1:mm AM/PM (where h1 is either '01', '02', ..., '12', and m is the minute part of the input)**
