Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of `s`, `m` is the minute part of `s`, `h1` is an empty string, `m1` is equal to `m`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `m` to `m1` and initializes `h1` as an empty string. The values of `s`, `t`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
