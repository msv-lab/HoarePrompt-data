To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm". This means `s` looks like "10:30", "02:15", etc.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440. This integer is related to the time but not directly used in the print statement.
   - `h` is the hour part of `s`. So, if `s` is "10:30", then `h` is "10".
   - `m` is the minute part of `s`. If `s` is "10:30", then `m` is "30".
   - `h1` is either "01" or one of the hours "02", "03", ..., "12", "13", "14", "16", "17". This means `h1` could be any of these values depending on the original `h`.
   - `m1` is equal to `m`. So, if `m` is "30", then `m1` is also "30".
   - `time` is 'AM' if `h` is "10" or "11", and 'PM' if `h` is "17".

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`.
   - `sep=''` means there will be no separator between the printed items, so they will be printed consecutively without spaces.

Given the conditions:
- If `h` is "10" or "11", `time` will be 'AM'.
- If `h` is "17", `time` will be 'PM'.

Let's consider the possible scenarios for `h` and `h1`:
- If `h` is "10" or "11", `h1` will be "10" or "11" respectively.
- If `h` is "17", `h1` will be "17".
- For other hours, `h1` will be "02", "03", ..., "12", "13", "14", "16".

Since `h1` is derived from `h` and the print statement does not change `h1`, `m`, or `time`, the output will be:
- If `h` is "10" or "11", the output will be "10:30 AM" or "11:30 AM".
- If `h` is "17", the output will be "17:30 PM".
- For other hours, the output will be "xx:30 PM" where xx is the hour in the range "02" to "16".

Since the exact `h` is not specified, the most precise answer is:
Output: **h1 : m1 PM (where h1 is either "01", "02", "03", ..., "12", "13", "14", "16", "17" depending on the original hour h, m1 is the same as m, and time is 'PM' if h is "17")**
