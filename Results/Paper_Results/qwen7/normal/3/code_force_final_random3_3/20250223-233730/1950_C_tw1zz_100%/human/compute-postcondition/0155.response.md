Postcondition: `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of `s`, `m` is the minute part of `s`, and `m1` is equal to `m`. Additionally, `h1` is set to '07' if `h` is '19', '08' if `h` is '20', '09' if `h` is '21', '10' if `h` is '22', '12' if `h` is '23', and `time` is set to 'PM' if `h` is '21', '22', or '23', and 'AM' otherwise.
