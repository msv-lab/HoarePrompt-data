Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of `s`, `m` is the minute part of `s`, `h1` is '07', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '19'.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
