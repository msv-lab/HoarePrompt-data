Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of `s` and its current value is '11', `m` is the minute part of `s` and is equal to `m1`, `h1` is '11', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is not equal to '10'.**

Explanation: The code `h1 = '11'` assigns the value '11' to the variable `h1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
