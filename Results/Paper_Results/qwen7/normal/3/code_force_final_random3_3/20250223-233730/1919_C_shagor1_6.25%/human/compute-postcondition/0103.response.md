Postcondition: `a` is the last element of the tuple `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `a` is greater than `x`, then `y` is set to `a`. Additionally, if `a` is greater than `x` and `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `y` is set to `a`. Furthermore, if `a` is greater than `x` and `a` is greater than `y`, `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is incremented by 1.
