Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is now equal to `a`, `y` is either the second element of `inp` or remains `n + 1` depending on the condition, `ans` is 1 if the third element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x`, 2 if the fourth element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x`, and 0 otherwise, and `a` is the next element in `inp`.**

Explanation: The code `x = a` simply assigns the value of `a` to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `x` is updated to be equal to `a`, but the values of `t`, `n`, `inp`, `y`, `ans`, and `a` remain as they were before the assignment.
