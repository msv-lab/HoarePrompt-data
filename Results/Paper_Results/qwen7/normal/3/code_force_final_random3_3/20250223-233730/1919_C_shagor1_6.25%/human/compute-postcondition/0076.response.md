Postcondition: `a` is the third element of the tuple `inp`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` and `y` are both \(n + 1\). If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `a` is assigned to `y`. Otherwise, `a` remains as the third element of the tuple `inp`, `ans` changes to either 1 or 2, and `x` is \(n + 1\) while `y` is now equal to `a` and `x != y`.
