Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is the last element of the tuple `inp`, `ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, and the number of remaining iterations is an input integer; `inp` is updated to a tuple of integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
for a in inp:
    if a <= x:
        x = a
    elif a <= y:
        y = a
    else:
        x == y
        y = a
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is the last element of the tuple `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `a` is greater than `x`, then either `y` is set to `a` (if `a` is less than or equal to `y`), or `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is the next element in the tuple `inp`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` is either the value of `a` (if `a <= x` and `a <= y`), or the value of `a` (if `a > x` or `a > y`), and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a > y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is the next element in the tuple `inp`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` is the minimum value between `a`, `x`, and `y`, and `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
