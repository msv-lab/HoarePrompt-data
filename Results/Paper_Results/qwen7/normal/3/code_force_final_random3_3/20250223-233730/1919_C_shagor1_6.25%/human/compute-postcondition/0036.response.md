Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is the next element in `inp` (after `a`), `ans` is 1 if the third element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x`, 2 if the fourth element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x`, and 0 otherwise, and `a` is the next element in `inp`.**
