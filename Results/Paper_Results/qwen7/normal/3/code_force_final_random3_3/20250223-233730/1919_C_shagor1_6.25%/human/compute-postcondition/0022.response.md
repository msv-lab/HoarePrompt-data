Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is now equal to the second element of `inp`, `ans` is 1 if the next element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `ans` is 0, and `a` is the second element of `inp`**.

In this output state, the variable `y` has been updated to be equal to the second element of the tuple `inp`. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions as described in the initial state.
