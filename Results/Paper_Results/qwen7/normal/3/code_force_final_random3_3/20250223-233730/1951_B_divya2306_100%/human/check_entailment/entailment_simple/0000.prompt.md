# Problem:
[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

# Annotated Program:

    t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is 3, `i` is 9999, `n` is at least 2, and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `wins` as long as `a[i]` is less than or equal to `a[k-1]`. After 3 iterations, `wins` is 3. Since the loop condition is based on the index `i`, which ranges from 0 to `n-1`, the loop will stop either when `i` reaches `n` or when it finds an element in `a` that is greater than `a[k-1]`. Given that the loop executed 3 times, `i` would be 3 before the next iteration would check the condition. However, since the problem specifies the loop executes exactly 3 times, `i` must be 2 after the third iteration, meaning the fourth iteration (where `i` would be 3) would not occur because the loop would have already broken or completed its full range. Therefore, `i` could be up to 9999 (assuming `n` is at least 10000, given the constraints), but in the context of the problem, it would be the maximum value `n` can take, which is 100000, minus the number of iterations already performed, adjusted to fit within the loop's range. The other variables (`n` and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: 2
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `wins` is 3, `i` is 9999, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and the condition `wins < k` holds true
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is 5, `win_with_swap` is 8, `i` is 9, `k` is an integer greater than 8.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `win_with_swap` as long as `a[i]` is greater than `a[k-1]`. After the third iteration, `win_with_swap` becomes 7 and `i` is 8. Since `k` must be greater than 8 for the loop to continue, we can deduce that after all iterations, `win_with_swap` will be incremented one more time (making it 8), and `i` will be set to `win_with_swap + 1`, which is 9. The value of `wins` remains unchanged at 5 because the condition `wins < k` was met initially but does not change within the loop. `k` itself is not modified by the loop, so it remains an integer greater than 8.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: 4
