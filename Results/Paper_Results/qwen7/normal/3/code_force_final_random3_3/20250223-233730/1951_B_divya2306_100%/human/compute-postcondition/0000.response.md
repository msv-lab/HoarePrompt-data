Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n;**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `k` are now assigned the values provided by the user, but their specific values are not known yet. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 10^4. The list `a` is not defined or modified by this code, so its initial state remains unaffected.
