ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct.

    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is 3, `i` is 9999, `n` is at least 2, and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `wins` as long as `a[i]` is less than or equal to `a[k-1]`. After 3 iterations, `wins` is 3. Since the loop condition is based on the index `i`, which ranges from 0 to `n-1`, the loop will stop either when `i` reaches `n` or when it finds an element in `a` that is greater than `a[k-1]`. Given that the loop executed 3 times, `i` would be 3 before the next iteration would check the condition. However, since the problem specifies the loop executes exactly 3 times, `i` must be 2 after the third iteration, meaning the fourth iteration (where `i` would be 3) would not occur because the loop would have already broken or completed its full range. Therefore, `i` could be up to 9999 (assuming `n` is at least 10000, given the constraints), but in the context of the problem, it would be the maximum value `n` can take, which is 100000, minus the number of iterations already performed, adjusted to fit within the loop's range. The other variables (`n` and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: 2
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `wins` is 3, `i` is 9999, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and the condition `wins < k` holds true
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is 5, `win_with_swap` is 8, `i` is 9, `k` is an integer greater than 8.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `win_with_swap` as long as `a[i]` is greater than `a[k-1]`. After the third iteration, `win_with_swap` becomes 7 and `i` is 8. Since `k` must be greater than 8 for the loop to continue, we can deduce that after all iterations, `win_with_swap` will be incremented one more time (making it 8), and `i` will be set to `win_with_swap + 1`, which is 9. The value of `wins` remains unchanged at 5 because the condition `wins < k` was met initially but does not change within the loop. `k` itself is not modified by the loop, so it remains an integer greater than 8.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: 4
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `a` and two indices `n` and `k`. It counts the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to the element at index `k-1` and stores this count in `wins`. If this count is at least `k`, it prints `wins - 1` and returns. Otherwise, it calculates a potential improved count `win_with_swap` by considering a swap and prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`. The function ultimately returns `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of matches a cow at position `k` can win.
   - We can either do nothing or swap the cow at position `k` with another cow.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of wins.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cows) and `k` (position of the cow).
   - It then reads the ratings of the cows into a list `a`.
   - The variable `wins` is initialized to 0 and is used to count the number of consecutive wins starting from the cow at position `k`.

3. **First Loop (`for i in range(n):`):**
   - This loop checks how many cows with a higher rating than the cow at position `k` come before it.
   - If a cow with a higher rating comes before the cow at position `k`, the loop breaks, and `wins` is set to the number of such cows.
   - This logic is correct for determining the initial number of wins without any swaps.

4. **Checking Without Swap:**
   - The code then checks if the cow at position `k` can win more matches if no swap is done.
   - If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `wins - 1`. This is because the cow at position `k` would lose the first match if it were to play against a higher-rated cow.

5. **Checking With Swap:**
   - If no swap is beneficial, the code then considers swapping the cow at position `k` with another cow.
   - It calculates the number of wins if the cow at position `k` is swapped with a cow that has a lower rating but is still higher than the cow at position `k` in the initial sequence.
   - The variable `win_with_swap` is updated similarly to `wins`, but considering the potential swap.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases where the cow at position `k` might not have any higher-rated cows before it, and it correctly accounts for this scenario.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k` by either doing nothing or swapping with another cow.

### Correctness:
**True**
