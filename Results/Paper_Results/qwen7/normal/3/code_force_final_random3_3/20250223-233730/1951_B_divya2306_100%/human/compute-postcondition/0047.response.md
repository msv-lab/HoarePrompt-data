Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, it also accepts two integers n and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a list a of n distinct integers, each between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. After processing these inputs, the function does not return any value (returns None).**
