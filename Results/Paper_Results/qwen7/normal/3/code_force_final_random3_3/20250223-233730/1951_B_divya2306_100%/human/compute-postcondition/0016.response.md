Output State: **`wins` is 2, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `wins` and `i`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial state and the fact that no variables are modified by the `break` statement, the values of `wins` and `i` remain unchanged.
