Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):`
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `win_with_swap`, and `k`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `wins` is 5.
   - `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for values of `i` starting from `win_with_swap` up to `k - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `wins` is not part of the loop head, it remains unchanged.
   - `i` starts from `win_with_swap` and increases by 1 in each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k - 1`. Therefore, `i` should be `win_with_swap + 1` (the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration) and `k` must remain the same.

Given that `i` was at the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was `win_with_swap` (since it starts from there). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `win_with_swap + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `wins` remains 5.
- `i` becomes `win_with_swap + 1`.
- `k` remains the same.

Since `k` is not specified to change and `wins` is not part of the loop head, we don't need to adjust those states.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`wins` is 5, `i` is win_with_swap + 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`**
