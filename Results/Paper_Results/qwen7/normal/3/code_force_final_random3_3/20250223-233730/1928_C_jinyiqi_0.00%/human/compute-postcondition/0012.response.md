Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Understand the changes at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `i` is an integer and it is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

4. **Check the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k` and `x` remained the same integer.

5. **Determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.

6. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - The loop will continue if `k + 1` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - If `k + 1` is greater than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, the loop will terminate.

7. **Adjust the states**:
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `i` is now `k + 1`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is `k + 1`**, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
