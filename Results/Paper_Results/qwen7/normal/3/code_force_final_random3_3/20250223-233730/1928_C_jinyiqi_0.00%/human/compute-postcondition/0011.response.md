Postcondition: **`x` is an integer, `i` is an integer and equals `i + 1`. If `x` is divisible by `i + 1`, then `output1` is a list with the element `i + 1` and `output2` is a list with the element `x / (i + 1)`. If `x` is not divisible by `i + 1`, the values of `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged.**
