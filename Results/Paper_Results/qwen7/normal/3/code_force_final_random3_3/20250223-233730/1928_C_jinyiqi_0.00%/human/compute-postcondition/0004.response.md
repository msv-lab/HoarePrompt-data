Output State: **`x` is an integer, i is an integer, x is divisible by i, and `output1` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The line `output1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `output1`. Since `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), the value of `i` is added to `output1`. The values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged.
