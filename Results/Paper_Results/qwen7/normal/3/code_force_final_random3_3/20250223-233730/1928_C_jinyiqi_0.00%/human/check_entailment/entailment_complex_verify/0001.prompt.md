You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and n are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.

            output2.append(int(x / i))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `output1` contains all divisors of `x` in ascending order, and `output2` contains the corresponding quotients in descending order.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that combines the divisors of x in descending order (from `output1`) with the corresponding quotients in descending order (from `output2`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer \( x \) and returns a list containing the divisors of \( x \) in descending order, followed by the corresponding quotients in descending order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - An empty list `output` is initialized to store possible values of `k`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It returns a list of divisors in ascending order.

5. **Processing Divisors:**
   - For each divisor `s` from `func_1(n + x - 2)` and `func_1(n - x)`, it checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - If both conditions are met, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to `output`.

6. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - The `output` list is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then back to a list.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Condition Check:
- The condition `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that `n + x - 2` is even, which is necessary for the settling pattern to repeat correctly.
- Similarly, `(n - x) % 2 == 0` ensures that `n - x` is even.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function correctly finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in ascending order.
- However, the logic of using `output2 + output1` to reverse the order is unnecessary since the loop already iterates in ascending order.

#### Processing Divisors:
- The logic for checking if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` is correct.
- The value `(s + 2) / 2` represents the possible value of `k`.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- The constraints ensure that the answer is finite, and the program handles the conditions correctly.
- The logic for finding divisors and filtering valid `k` values is sound.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, we find that it correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
