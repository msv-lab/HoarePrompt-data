Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The formula used in the program does not accurately reflect the strategy Eve should use to maximize Bob's wins. Specifically, the formula `sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3` does not correctly simulate the optimal removal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the parity of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s and how removing numbers affects the overall XOR result. The optimal strategy involves removing numbers in a way that maintains the condition for Bob to win as many times as possible. The given formula does not account for these complexities and thus fails to provide the correct output for various inputs.
