Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively, and returns the total count of these numbers.**

This means the function is expected to take in four integers that represent the quantities of different types of elements (1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s) in a sequence and then return the sum of these quantities.
