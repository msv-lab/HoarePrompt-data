The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates the sum of specific formulas applied to these counts, divides the result by 3, and outputs the integer part of this division. The function then prints the calculated value for each test case on a new line.
