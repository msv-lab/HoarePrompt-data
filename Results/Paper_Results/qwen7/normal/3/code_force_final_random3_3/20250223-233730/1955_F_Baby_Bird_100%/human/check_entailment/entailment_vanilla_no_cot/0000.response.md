Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the formula used in the program does not accurately determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the counts of the numbers in the sequence.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the bitwise XOR operation and how removing numbers affects the overall XOR result. The provided solution uses a different approach that does not align with the problem requirements.
