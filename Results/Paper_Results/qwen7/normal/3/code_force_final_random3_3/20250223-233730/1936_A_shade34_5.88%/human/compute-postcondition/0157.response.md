Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(1, len(pans))`. This means the loop starts from `i = 1` and continues as long as `i < len(pans)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is assigned the value of `mak`, which is `i`.
   - `n` is `n-1`.
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n-1`.
   - `str` is `'>'`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be one less than its starting value for the next iteration.
   - `n` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - `pans` remains the same as it does not change within the loop body.
   - `str` remains `'>'` as it does not change within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `n` will be decremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `pans` and `str` remain unchanged.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is assigned the value of `mak`, which is `i`.
- `n` is `n-1`.
- `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n-1`.
- `str` is `'>'`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` will be decremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is `mak + 1`, `n` is `n-2`, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n-1`, and `str` is `'>'`.**
