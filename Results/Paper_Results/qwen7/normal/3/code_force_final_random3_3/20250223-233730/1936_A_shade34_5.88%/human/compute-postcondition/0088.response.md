Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `mak` is explicitly given as 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but this variable is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak` is 0 again.
- `i` is 3.
- `i` is 3 again.

So, the output will be:
Output: **'? 0 0 3 3'**
