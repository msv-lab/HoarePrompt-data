Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is an empty list, a string input has been read and its value is less than the character '<'**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the standard output stream. Since no variables are modified, the initial state remains unchanged.
