Output State: **`pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `mak` is equal to `0`, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n` times.**

Explanation: The variable `mak` is directly assigned the value `0`. All other variables (`pans`, `i`, `mak2`) retain their previous values from the initial state. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been executed `n` times as mentioned in the initial state.
