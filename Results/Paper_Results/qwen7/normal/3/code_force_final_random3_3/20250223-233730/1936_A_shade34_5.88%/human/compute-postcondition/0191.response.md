Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mak` is `i`, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. Since `i` was previously `i + 1`, `mak` now holds the same value as `i`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
