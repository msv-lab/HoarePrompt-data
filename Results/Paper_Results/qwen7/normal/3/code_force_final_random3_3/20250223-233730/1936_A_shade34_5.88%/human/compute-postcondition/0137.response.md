Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is defined as `k + 2`
- `n` must be greater than `k`

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `k + 2`
- There are no explicit values given for `mak` and `mak2`, so we cannot determine their exact values.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] k+2 [mak2]**
