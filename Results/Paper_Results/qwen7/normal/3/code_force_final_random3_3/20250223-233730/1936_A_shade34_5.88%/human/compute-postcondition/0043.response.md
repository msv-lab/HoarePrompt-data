Output State: **`i` is 1, 2, or 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `s` is an input string, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` if `s` is '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `mak` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` can be 1, 2, or 3, `mak` will also be one of these values. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
