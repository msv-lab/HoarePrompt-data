Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `pans`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range starting from 1 to the length of `pans`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `mak + 1`
   - `n` is `n - 2`
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n - 1`
   - `mak` is `i` if the input is `'>'`; otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `pans`, and `mak` remain unchanged.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than the length of `pans`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mak + 1`.
   - The length of `pans` is `n`, and since `n` was updated to `n - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the new length of `pans` is `n - 2`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 2`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so `i` becomes `mak + 2`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mak + 3` (since `i` starts from `mak + 1` and needs to be less than `n - 2`).

7. **Final state**:
   - `pans` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `mak` remains unchanged unless the input is `'>'`, but since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we do not change `mak`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `mak + 2`, `n` is `n - 2` and must be greater than or equal to `mak + 3`, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n - 1`, and `mak` is `i` if the input is `'>'; otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `pans`, and `mak` remain unchanged.**
