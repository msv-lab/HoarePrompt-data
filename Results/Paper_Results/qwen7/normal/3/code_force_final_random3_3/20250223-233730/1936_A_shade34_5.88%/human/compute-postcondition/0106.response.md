Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `mak` is `n-1`, a string input has been read and its value is less than the character '<', and `n` must be greater than `n-1`.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the input integer `n`, `mak` will be `n-1`, and the condition for the loop to continue (`i < n`) will no longer be true because `i` equals `n`. Additionally, the loop reads a string input each time, and for all these inputs, the value is less than the character '<'.
