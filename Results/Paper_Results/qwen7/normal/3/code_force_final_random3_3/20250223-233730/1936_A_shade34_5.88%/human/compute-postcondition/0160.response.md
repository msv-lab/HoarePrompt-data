Output State: **`i` is `mak + 1`, `n` is `n-2`, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n-1`, and `mak` is `i`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `mak + 1`) to the variable `mak`. All other variables (`n`, `pans`, and `str`) remain unchanged.
