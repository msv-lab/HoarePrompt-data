Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is less than `n` and at least 1.
- `n` is an input integer.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The string `'?'` is directly printed.
2. The variable `mak` is not defined in the initial state, so it is unknown. We cannot determine its value without additional information.
3. The variable `i` is known to be an integer that is less than `n` and at least 1.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.

Output: **'? mak mak [i] [i]' (where i is an integer less than n and at least 1, and mak is undefined)**
