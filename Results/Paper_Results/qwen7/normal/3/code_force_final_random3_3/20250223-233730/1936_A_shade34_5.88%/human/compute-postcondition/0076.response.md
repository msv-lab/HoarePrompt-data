Output State: **`i` is 3, `mak` is 2**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `mak`. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are updated or assigned new values, their states remain unchanged.
