The function interacts with a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\). It asks up to \(3n\) comparison queries of the form "? a b c d" to determine these indices and then prints "! i j" where \(i\) and \(j\) are the found indices.
