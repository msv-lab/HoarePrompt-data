Output State: **`i` is assigned the value of `mak`, which is `i`; `n` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n-1`, and `str` is `'>'`.**

Explanation: The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is `n-1`, `mak` also becomes `n-1`. The values of `n`, `pans`, and `str` remain unchanged.
