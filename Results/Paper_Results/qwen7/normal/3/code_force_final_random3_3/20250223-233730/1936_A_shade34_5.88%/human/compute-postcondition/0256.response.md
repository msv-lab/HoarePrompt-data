Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `pans`, `n` is 0, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `len(pans) - 1`, and `mak` is equal to `len(pans) - 1`.

After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `pans`, which is `n` (the original length of the permutation). Since `n` decreases by 1 each iteration and starts as the length of `pans`, it becomes 0 after `n` iterations. `pans` contains all integers from `0` to `len(pans) - 1` because it accumulates all indices that satisfy certain conditions throughout the iterations. Finally, `mak` is set to `len(pans) - 1` after the last comparison inside the loop.
