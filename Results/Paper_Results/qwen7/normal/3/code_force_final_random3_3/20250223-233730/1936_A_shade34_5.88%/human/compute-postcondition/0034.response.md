Output State: **`i` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the original value of `n`; `n` must be greater than 3; `s` is a string input by the user, and `s` is not equal to '<'; the current value of `s` is '='; `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since the initial value of `i` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the original value of `n`, and `n` must be greater than 3, `i` retains its initial value. The value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. Therefore, `pans` now contains the value of `i`.
