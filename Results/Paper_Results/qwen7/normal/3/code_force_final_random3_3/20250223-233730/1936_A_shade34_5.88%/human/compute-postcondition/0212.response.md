Based on the initial state provided:

- `pans` is a list.
- `i` is less than `n` (i.e., `i + 1 < n`).
- `mak` is equal to `i` or `n-1`.
- `mak2` is equal to `n-1`.
- `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n-1` times.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Let's break down the values of the variables:

- `mak`: This can either be `i` or `n-1`. Since `i` is less than `n`, both `i` and `n-1` are valid values for `mak`.
- `mak2`: This is explicitly stated to be `n-1`.
- `i`: This is a value such that `i + 1 < n`, meaning `i` is any integer from `0` to `n-2`.

Given these conditions, the print statement will output a string with the following components:
- The character `'?'`
- The value of `mak` (which could be `i` or `n-1`)
- The value of `mak2` (which is `n-1`)
- The value of `i`
- The value of `mak2` (which is `n-1` again)

Therefore, the output will be a string that includes `'?'`, followed by one of two possible values for `mak` (either `i` or `n-1`), then `n-1`, then `i`, and finally `n-1` again.

Output: **'? [i or n-1] [n-1] [i] [n-1]** (where `[i or n-1]` represents either `i` or `n-1`, depending on the value assigned to `mak`)
