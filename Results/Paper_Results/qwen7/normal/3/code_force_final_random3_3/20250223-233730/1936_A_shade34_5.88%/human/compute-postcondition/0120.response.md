Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the element `i`, the new string `s` is assigned the value of the input string which is not equal to '<', and the current value of `s` is equal to '='.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `pans` was initially an empty list, after appending `i`, `pans` now contains the single element `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
