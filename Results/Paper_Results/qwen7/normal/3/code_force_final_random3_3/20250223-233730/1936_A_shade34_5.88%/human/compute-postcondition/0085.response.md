Output State: **`i` is 3, `mak` is 3, `n` is an input integer**

The code assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `i` and `mak` remain unchanged from their initial states. The user must provide a positive integer as input for the loop to execute again, but since no loop is specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is the assignment to `n`.
