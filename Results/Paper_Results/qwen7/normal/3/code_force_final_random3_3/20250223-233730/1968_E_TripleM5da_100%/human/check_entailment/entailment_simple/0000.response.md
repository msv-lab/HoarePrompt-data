Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. The program iterates over each test case using a loop controlled by `input()`.
2. For each test case, it initializes `n` and prints two fixed points: `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
3. Then, it enters another loop starting from `i = 3` up to `n`, printing points of the form `(i, i)`.

### Analysis:
- For small values of \(n\) (e.g., \(n = 2, 3, 4\)), the program does not generate enough unique Manhattan distances to achieve the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
- Specifically, for \(n = 2\), the only printed points are `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct but not the maximum possible for \(n = 2\).
- For \(n = 3\), the points printed are `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(3, 3)`, resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which is correct but not the maximum possible for \(n = 3\).

### Example for \(n = 3\):
- The optimal arrangement should include points like `(2, 1)`, `(2, 3)`, and `(3, 1)` to achieve \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not generate the optimal set of points for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
