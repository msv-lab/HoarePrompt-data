Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `i` is explicitly given as 9.
- `n` must be at least 9, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly given as 9, the print statement will output the value of `i` twice.

Output: **9 9**
