Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 7.
   - `n` must be at least 9, but its exact value is not specified.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(i, i)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print(i, i)` statement will print the value of `i` twice.
   - From the initial state, we know that `i` is 7.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the print statement will output the number 7 twice.

Output: **7 7**
