Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program attempts to generate a specific pattern of points for each \(n\).
3. Let's analyze the program's logic:
   - It starts by printing the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - Then, for each \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), it prints \((i, i)\).

4. We need to check if this approach maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\):
   - For small values of \(n\), the program's output might seem to work, but we need to verify if it consistently maximizes \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).
   - Consider \(n = 3\):
     - The program outputs: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\).
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) (size 4).
   - Consider \(n = 4\):
     - The program outputs: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\).
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) (size 7).
   - This pattern seems to work for these small values, but let's consider larger \(n\).

5. For larger \(n\), the program's output might not always maximize \(\mathcal{H}\):
   - For example, for \(n = 6\):
     - The program outputs: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), \((6, 6)\).
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\}\) (size 13).
   - However, a better arrangement could be:
     - \((1, 1)\), \((1, 3)\), \((4, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), \((6, 1)\).
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\}\) (size 14).

Given the above analysis, the program does not always generate the maximum possible set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
