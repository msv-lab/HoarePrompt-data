Based on the initial state provided, we have:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `i` is currently 4.
- `n` must be at least 13.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Here, `i` is explicitly stated to be 4. Therefore, the `print` statement will output the value of `i` twice.

Output: **4 4**
