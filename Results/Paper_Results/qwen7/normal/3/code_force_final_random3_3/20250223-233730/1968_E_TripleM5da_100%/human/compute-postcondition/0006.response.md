Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `3, n + 1`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 3` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `3` to `n + 1`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 3` and increments by 1 each iteration, if the loop just finished an iteration, `i` would be one more than its value at the start of the previous iteration.
   - For example, if `i` was 3 at the start of the previous iteration, it would be 4 at the start of the current iteration.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` increases by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` must remain greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.

Given that the loop just finished an iteration where `i` was 3 (assuming this is the first iteration), the next value of `i` will be 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
