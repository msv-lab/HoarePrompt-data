Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Specifically, the program always prints the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) initially, and then prints a sequence of points \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This approach does not necessarily maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, consider \(n = 3\). The program would output:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
4 4
```

However, the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) should include points like \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\) to achieve the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances, as shown in the problem's example.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.
