Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(0, int(input())):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the input value used to determine the range of the loop.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)
   - `i` is 6
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 6

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `int(input()) - 1`. This means `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` each iteration until it reaches `int(input()) - 1`.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `1`. Since `i` is currently `6`, it will become `7` in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the Input Value**: The input value determines the upper limit of the range. Since `i` is `6` now, the input value must be such that `i` can reach `7` before the loop terminates. Therefore, the input value should be at least `8` (because `i` starts from `0` and needs to reach `7`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)
- `i` becomes `7`
- The input value must be at least `8` for the loop to continue

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 7, the input value must be at least 8**
