Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 7, `n` is an input integer which must be at least 8.**

The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. Since the input value must be at least 8, `n` will be an integer that is at least 8. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
