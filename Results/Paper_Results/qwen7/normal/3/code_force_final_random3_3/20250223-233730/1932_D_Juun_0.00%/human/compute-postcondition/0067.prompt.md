Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning all cards have been processed. Here's what the final state will look like:

- `trumps`: This list contains all the ranks of cards that had the same suit as the trump suit.
- `suits`: This dictionary will have each suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') mapped to either `None` (if no further cards of that suit were encountered) or the highest rank of the cards that had that suit but did not match the trump suit.
- `answers`: This list contains all the valid pairs of cards that were found to have the same suit, sorted and joined by a space. Each pair consists of the higher rank followed by the lower rank for each suit that was not the trump suit.

In summary, `trumps` will hold all ranks of cards that matched the trump suit, `suits` will indicate the highest rank for each non-trump suit, and `answers` will contain all valid pairs of cards from the same non-trump suit.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` is a list with one less element than before, `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is either `None` or a rank, `answers` is a list of valid card pairs with one additional element, which is a string formatted as '{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is either `None` or a rank; `answers` is a list with one element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop(){trump}', `trumps` is a list with one element less than before. If `trumps` is not empty, the function processes the first element of `trumps` and updates the corresponding value in `suits`. If `trumps` is empty, the function does not return any value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is either `None` or a rank; `answers` is a list with either one or two elements where the first element is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop(){trump}', the second element is a new string formatted as '{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}' if the if condition is met, `trumps` is a list with one element less than before, and the program returns None if the else condition is met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
