Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of the new card, `suit` is the suit part of the new card, `trump` remains the suit part of the next card, `trumps` is the list with the new `rank` appended to it, `suits[suit]` is now equal to the new `rank`, `answers` is a list containing two strings which are the sorted concatenations of `rank` and `rank` joined by a space and `suit` and `suit` joined by a space.**

Explanation: The code appends a new string to the `answers` list. This string is created by joining the sorted concatenations of `rank` and `rank` (resulting in `rank rank`) and `suit` and `suit` (resulting in `suit suit`). Since `answers` initially contained one string, after appending, it now contains two strings.
