Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of the next `card`; `suit` is the suit part of the next `card`; `trump` remains the suit part of the next `card`; `trumps` is the list with the values appended as per the previous iterations; `suits[suit]` is set to `None`; `answers` is a list containing one string which is the sorted concatenation of `suits[suit]` and `rank` joined by a space.**

In this output state, the `suits[suit]` variable is explicitly set to `None`, while all other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
