Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of `card`; `suit` is the suit part of `card`, the suit is not equal to `trump`; `suits[suit]` is None; `answers` now contains one more element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` in between.**

Explanation: The code `suits[suit] = None` sets the value of `suits[suit]` to `None`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `rank` and `suit` retain their original values, `suit` is not equal to `trump`, and `answers` contains one additional element, which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` (now `None`) and `rank` with `suit` in between.
