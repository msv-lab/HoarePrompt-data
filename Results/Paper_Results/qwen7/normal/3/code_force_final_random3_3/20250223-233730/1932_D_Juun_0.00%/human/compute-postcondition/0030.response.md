Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of the new card, `suit` is the suit part of the new card, `trump` remains the suit part of the next card, `trumps` is the list with the new `rank` appended to it, `suits[suit]` is now equal to the new `rank`, `answers` is a list containing one string which is the sorted concatenation of `rank` and `rank` joined by a space, `trumps` is the list with the new `rank` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `trumps.append(rank)` appends the value of `rank` to the list `trumps`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
