Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `trumps` is a list that is sorted and must not be empty.
   - We need to consider the nature of the list and the operations performed on it.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Execution**:
   - `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the list `trumps`.
   - This operation is performed twice in the print statement.
   - After the first `pop`, the last element of `trumps` is removed and stored in the first part of the formatted string.
   - The variable `trump` is mentioned, but it is not defined in the initial state. Since `trump` is not defined, it will be treated as a placeholder in the string formatting.

4. **Output Description**:
   - The first part of the print statement will be the last element of `trumps` followed by `trump`.
   - The second part of the print statement will be the second-to-last element of `trumps` followed by `trump`.

Given the above steps, the output will be:

Output: **[last element of trumps][trump] [second-to-last element of trumps][trump]**
