Output State: `trumps` is an empty list.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list because the loop continues to remove (pop) elements from `trumps` until it is empty. Given that the loop condition `trumps != []` ensures that the loop runs as long as `trumps` is not empty, once all elements are popped, the condition fails, and the loop terminates with `trumps` being empty.
