Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state:

1. **Initial State**: `trumps` is a sorted list and must not be empty.
2. **Code Snippet**: 
   ```python
   print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`trumps.pop()`**: This method removes and returns the last element from the `trumps` list. Since `trumps` is sorted and non-empty, let's denote the last element of `trumps` as `last_element`.

2. **`trump`**: This variable is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, it is a free variable and its value is unknown. We will keep it as `trump` in our output.

3. **First `trumps.pop()`**: After removing the last element (`last_element`), the next-to-last element of the updated `trumps` list is now the last element. Let's denote this next-to-last element as `second_last_element`.

4. **Second `trumps.pop()`**: This method removes and returns the new last element of the updated `trumps` list, which is `second_last_element`.

5. **String Formatting**: The `print` statement formats and prints the result as follows:
   - The first part is the last element of the original `trumps` list followed by `trump`.
   - A space is added.
   - The second part is the next-to-last element of the original `trumps` list followed by `trump`.

### Final Output:

Given the above steps, the output will be:
Output: **f'{last_element}{trump} {second_last_element}{trump}'**

Where:
- `last_element` is the last element of the original `trumps` list.
- `second_last_element` is the second last element of the original `trumps` list.
- `trump` is an unknown value.
