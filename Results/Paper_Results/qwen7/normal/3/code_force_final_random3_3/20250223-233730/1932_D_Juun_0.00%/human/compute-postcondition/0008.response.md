Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of `card`; `suit` is the suit part of `card`; `trump` is the suit part of `card`; `trumps` is a list with the value of `rank` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rank` to the list `trumps`. Since `rank` is the rank part of `card` and `suit` is the suit part of `card`, which is also equal to `trump`, the output state includes these relationships along with the updated `trumps` list.
