Postcondition: `rank` is the rank part of `card`; `suit` is the suit part of `card`; `trump` is the suit part of `card`. If `suit` equals `trump`, then `trumps` is a list with the value of `rank` appended to it. Otherwise, the suit is not equal to `trump`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, then `answers` now contains one more element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` in between. Otherwise, the value of `suits[suit]` is `rank`.
