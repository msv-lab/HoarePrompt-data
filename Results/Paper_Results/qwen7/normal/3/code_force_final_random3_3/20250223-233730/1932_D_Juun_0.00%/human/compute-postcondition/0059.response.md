Postcondition: `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is either `None` or a rank; `answers` is a list with one element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop(){trump}', `trumps` is a list with one element less than before. If `trumps` is not empty, the function processes the first element of `trumps` and updates the corresponding value in `suits`. If `trumps` is empty, the function does not return any value.
