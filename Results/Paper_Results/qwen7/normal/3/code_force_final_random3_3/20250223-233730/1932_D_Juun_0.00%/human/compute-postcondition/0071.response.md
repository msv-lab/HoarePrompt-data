The loop condition is `trumps != []`, which means the loop continues as long as `trumps` is not an empty list. At the end of the previous iteration, `trumps` is sorted and must not be empty.

For the loop to execute one more time, `trumps` must still not be an empty list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `trumps` remains non-empty.

State: **`trumps` is sorted and must not be empty**
