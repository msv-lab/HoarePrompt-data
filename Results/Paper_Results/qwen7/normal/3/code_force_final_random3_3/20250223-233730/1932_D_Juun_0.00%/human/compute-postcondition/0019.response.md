Postcondition: `rank` is the rank part of `card`; `suit` is the suit part of `card`; `trump` is the suit part of `card`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list with the value of `rank` appended to it. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` is updated such that if `suits[suit]` is `None`, it becomes a list containing a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` in between. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, it remains unchanged.
