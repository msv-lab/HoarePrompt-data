Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is either `i` or 3 depending on the previous values of `i`, `t` remains `t - n * n`, and `sum` is updated to `sum + 3 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, which happens for all iterations since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`. Therefore, `sum` will be the sum of `3 * n` for each iteration plus `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration, resulting in a final `sum` value of `3 * n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will remain as `2 * n + 2`, `n` will still be at least 1, `r` could be `i` or 3, `t` will be reduced by `n * n` for each iteration, and `sum` will be the total of `3 * n * n` plus `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all iterations.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    if j <= n:
        print(1, j, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))
    else:
        print(2, j % n, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` must be at least 1, `r` must be at least `n + 1`. After the if-else block executes, if `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the condition remains as described in the if part. Otherwise, the condition remains as described in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` must be at least 1, `r` must be at least `n + 1`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, no changes are made to `r`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `r` as well.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is an integer less than or equal to `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the program updates the state according to the if part. If `j` is greater than `n`, the program updates the state according to the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
