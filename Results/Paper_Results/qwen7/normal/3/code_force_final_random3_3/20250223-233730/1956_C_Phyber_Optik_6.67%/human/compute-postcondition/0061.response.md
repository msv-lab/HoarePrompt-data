Postcondition: `sum` is an integer, `r` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either `n + 3` or `n + r + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and the value of `sum` is determined by the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n)`. If the condition is true, `sum` is set to `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is set to 1, `j` is set to `n + 3`, and `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `sum` is set to `i * n`, `r` is set to 0, and `i` is set to 2.
