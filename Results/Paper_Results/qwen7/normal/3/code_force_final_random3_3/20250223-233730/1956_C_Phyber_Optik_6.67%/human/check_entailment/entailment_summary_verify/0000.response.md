### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix \( \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} \).
- We can perform up to 2n operations, where each operation is either a Type 1 (permuting rows) or Type 2 (permuting columns).
- The program needs to output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function processes multiple test cases, each involving two integers \( t \) and \( n \).
- It calculates a sum based on specific conditions and prints the sum along with certain values.
- It also prints a sequence of numbers in a particular format.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        (sum, r) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
                r = i
                sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
            else:
                sum += i * n
        print(sum, n + r)
        for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
            if j <= n:
                print(1, j, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
            else:
                print(2, j % n, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum calculation part is incorrect. The program attempts to calculate the sum based on a fixed pattern, which does not necessarily lead to the maximum possible sum.
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` is used to calculate a triangular number, which is not relevant to the problem.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program prints a sequence of operations, but these operations do not maximize the sum of the matrix.
   - For example, the program prints operations like:
     ```plaintext
     1 1 1 2 3 ... n
     2 1 1 2 3 ... n
     ```
   - These operations do not reflect the actual permutations needed to maximize the sum.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the sum and the number of operations, but the operations themselves do not achieve the maximum sum.

#### Correct Approach:
- To maximize the sum, we need to set each element \( a_{i,j} \) to its maximum value, which is \( n \).
- We can achieve this by performing \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations.
- For example, for \( n = 2 \):
  - Perform Type 1 operation on the first row with permutation \([2, 1]\):
    ```plaintext
    2 1
    0 0
    ```
  - Perform Type 2 operation on the first column with permutation \([2, 1]\):
    ```plaintext
    2 1
    2 1
    ```
  - This results in a sum of 8, which is the maximum possible sum.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix. It calculates the sum and the number of operations incorrectly and does not perform the necessary operations to achieve the maximum sum.

**Final: False**
