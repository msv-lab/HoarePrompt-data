To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the loop head and identify the relevant variables and their initial states:

- `j` is the loop variable.
- `n` and `r` are used in the loop condition.

Given the loop condition `range(1, n + r + 1)`, the loop will execute if `n + r + 1` is greater than 1. This means `n + r` must be at least 0. Additionally, `j` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n + r + 1`.

Now, let's consider the initial states of the variables:
- `sum` is the result of the loop computation.
- `r` will be set to `n` after the loop completes.
- `j` will be `n + r + 2`, which simplifies to `2n + 2` after the loop completes.
- `t` will be reduced by `n`.
- `i` will be `n` after the loop completes.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Since the loop head only involves `j`, `n`, and `r`, we need to ensure these variables are in a state that allows the loop to execute. Specifically, `n + r` should be at least 1, and `j` should start at 1.

Given the final states:
- `r` will be `n` after the loop.
- `j` will be `2n + 2` after the loop.
- `t` will be reduced by `n`.
- `i` will be `n` after the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged.

We need to ensure that the loop can start and execute properly based on the initial values of `n` and `r`.

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The loop will start with `j = 1`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j <= n + r + 1`.
3. **Final Values**:
   - `r` will be `n` after the loop.
   - `j` will be `2n + 2` after the loop.
   - `t` will be reduced by `n`.
   - `i` will be `n` after the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

### Adjusted States:
- `j` must start at 1.
- `n + r` must be at least 1 to ensure the loop can execute.

Since `r` will be set to `n` after the loop, we need to ensure that `n + n` (or `2n`) is at least 1 initially.

### Final State:
State: **`j` is 1, `n + r` must be at least 1 (initially `n + r` is 2n, so `n` must be at least 1), `t` is some initial value, `i` is some initial value, `n` is some initial value**.

Given the specific conditions:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `r` will be `n` after the loop, so `n + r` must be at least 1, which is satisfied if `n` is at least 1.

Thus, the key adjustment is ensuring `n` is at least 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `t` is some initial value, `i` is some initial value, `r` is some initial value**.
