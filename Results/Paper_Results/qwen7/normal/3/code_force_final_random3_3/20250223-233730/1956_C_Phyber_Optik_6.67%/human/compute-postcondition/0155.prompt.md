You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        sum, r = 0, 0
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
                r = i
                sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
            else:
                sum += i * n
        
        print(sum, n + r)
        
        for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
            if j <= n:
                print(1, j, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
            else:
                print(2, j % n, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: Output State: j = 3 * n + 3, n = initial n, r = 3, sum = 3 * n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2.
    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `j` will be `3 * n + 3`, as it increments by `1` in each iteration of the loop. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop iterations. The value of `r` is set to `3` after the third iteration. The value of `sum` is calculated as `3 * n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`, which represents the sum accumulated over all three iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case involves two integers: t and n. For each test case, t is an integer within the range 1 to 500, and n is an integer within the range 1 to 500. Additionally, the sum of n² across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵. The function processes these test cases and returns results based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
