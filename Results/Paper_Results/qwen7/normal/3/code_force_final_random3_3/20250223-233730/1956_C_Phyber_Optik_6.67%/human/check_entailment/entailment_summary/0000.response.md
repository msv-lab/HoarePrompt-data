Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix using at most 2n operations.
2. The provided code seems to attempt to calculate the sum and the number of operations required.
3. Let's break down the logic of the code:
   - `t` is read as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is read as the size of the matrix.
   - A variable `r` is initialized to 0.
   - A loop runs from 1 to `n`, where:
     - If `n * (n + 1) // 2` (the sum of the first `n` natural numbers) is greater than `i * n`, then `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
     - Otherwise, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.
   - The sum and `n + r` are printed.
   - A series of operations are printed, where:
     - For the first `n` operations, a Type 1 operation is performed on rows, setting each row to a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - For the remaining operations, a Type 2 operation is performed on columns, setting each column to a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. The logic for calculating the sum and determining the number of operations seems to be correct. However, we need to verify if the operations actually maximize the sum as required.

5. The operations described in the code seem to correctly set each row and column to a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which will indeed maximize the sum of the matrix.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
