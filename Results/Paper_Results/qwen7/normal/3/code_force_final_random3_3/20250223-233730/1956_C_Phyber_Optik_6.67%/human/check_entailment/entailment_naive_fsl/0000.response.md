Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix. Specifically, the program calculates the sum and the number of operations without actually performing the operations as described. Instead, it seems to be calculating the sum based on a fixed pattern, which does not necessarily lead to the maximum possible sum.

To illustrate, let's consider a small example:

- For \( n = 2 \):
  - The initial matrix is:
    ```
    0 0
    0 0
    ```
  - According to the problem, we need to perform operations to maximize the sum. The correct approach would involve setting specific values in the matrix using the allowed operations.
  - However, the provided program simply prints a sum and the number of operations without actually performing the operations to achieve the maximum sum.

For instance, the correct way to maximize the sum for \( n = 2 \) would be:
- Perform a Type 1 operation on the first row with the permutation \([2, 1]\):
  ```
  2 1
  0 0
  ```
- Perform a Type 2 operation on the first column with the permutation \([2, 1]\):
  ```
  2 1
  2 1
  ```

This results in a sum of 8, which is the maximum possible sum for \( n = 2 \). However, the provided program does not perform these operations and instead calculates a sum based on a different logic, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
