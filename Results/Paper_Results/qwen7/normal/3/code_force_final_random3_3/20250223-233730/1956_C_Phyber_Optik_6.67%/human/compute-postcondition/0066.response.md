Output State: **`sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` or `2 * n + 2 * n` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`, `r` is either 1 or 0, `j` is either `n + 3` or `n + r + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `sum += i * n` increments `sum` by the value of `i * n`. Given that `i` is 2, `sum` is updated by adding `2 * n` to its current value. The conditions for `sum` remain the same, and the other variables (`r`, `j`, `t`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected by this operation.
