To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initialization**: We start with the initial state where `sum` is the cumulative sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` added to `i * n` for each iteration from 1 to `n`, and `r` is set to the last value of `i` which satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If no such `i` exists, `r` is set to the last value of `i`, which is `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, the loop checks if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - If the condition holds, `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - If the condition fails, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.
   - `r` is updated to the last value of `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true.

3. **Final Values**:
   - `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all other `i`.
   - `r` will be the largest `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true, or `n` if no such `i` exists.

Given this understanding, let's describe the output:

- `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all other `i`.
- `r` will be the largest `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true, or `n` if no such `i` exists.

Thus, the print statement will output these values.

Output: **sum (which is the sum of n * (n + 1) // 2 for all i such that n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n, plus the sum of i * n for all other i), n + r (where r is the largest i for which the condition n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n holds true, or n if no such i exists)**
