### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations.
   - Each operation can either permute the rows or columns.
   - The sum of the matrix is maximized when the largest possible values are placed in the top-left corner of the matrix.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calculates the sum of the matrix and the number of operations required.
   - The logic to calculate the sum and the number of operations is as follows:
     - The sum of the matrix is calculated as the sum of the first \(i \times n\) elements for the first \(r\) rows, where \(r\) is determined such that \(n \times (n + 1) / 2 > i \times n\).
     - The number of operations is \(n + r\), where \(r\) is the number of full rows plus one additional row.
   - The operations are printed in the form specified, alternating between row and column permutations until the required number of operations is reached.

3. **Verification**:
   - **Sum Calculation**:
     - The sum calculation logic is flawed. The current implementation attempts to partition the matrix into segments and sum them, but it does not ensure that the sum is maximized.
     - The correct approach would be to fill the top-left \(k \times k\) submatrix with the largest possible values, where \(k\) is the largest integer such that \(k^2 \leq n^2\).
   - **Number of Operations**:
     - The number of operations is correctly calculated as \(n + r\), but the actual operations performed do not necessarily maximize the sum.
     - The operations are printed in a fixed pattern, which may not be optimal for maximizing the sum.
   - **Operations**:
     - The operations are printed in a way that alternates between row and column permutations, but this does not guarantee that the sum is maximized.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Sum Calculation**:
  - The current implementation calculates the sum based on a condition that checks if \(n \times (n + 1) / 2 > i \times n\). This does not correctly determine the optimal number of rows to fill with the largest values.
  - A better approach would be to fill the top-left \(k \times k\) submatrix with the values 1 through \(k^2\), where \(k\) is the largest integer such that \(k^2 \leq n^2\).

- **Operations**:
  - The operations are printed in a fixed pattern, which does not necessarily maximize the sum. For example, filling the top-left \(k \times k\) submatrix with the largest values and then filling the rest of the matrix with smaller values would yield a higher sum.

### Conclusion:

The given solution does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix. The sum calculation and the operations performed do not guarantee that the sum is maximized.

**Final: False**
