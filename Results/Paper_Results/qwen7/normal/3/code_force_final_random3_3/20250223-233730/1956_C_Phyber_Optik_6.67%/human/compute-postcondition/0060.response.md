Output State: **`sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0, `j` is `n + r + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n)` holds true.**

Explanation: The line `sum += i * n` updates the value of `sum` by adding `i * n` to its current value. Initially, `sum` is 0, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. After the first iteration, `i` becomes 2 due to the increment in the next iteration (though not shown here). The condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n)` still holds true because `i` has incremented. All other variables (`r`, `j`, `t`) remain unchanged.
