Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n + r`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `n + r + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + r`.
   - Given that `j` is currently 2, the next value of `j` would be 3.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains at least 1.
   - `j` must still be less than or equal to `n + r`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `j` is 3, `n` is at least 1, and `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`.**
