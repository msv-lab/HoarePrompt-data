Output State: **`j` is `n + r + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is initial `r`, `sum` is `0`**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `j`, `t`, `r`, and `sum` remain unchanged from their initial states.
