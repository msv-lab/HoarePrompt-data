Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `i` from 1 to `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1` (the first value in the range), `i` should be set to 1 at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n + 1`. Therefore, `n` must be a non-negative integer such that the loop can execute at least once.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The variables `sum`, `r`, `j`, and `t` are not directly involved in the loop condition or the loop body, so their initial values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `i` should be set to 1.
- `n` must be a non-negative integer (greater than or equal to 0) to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

So, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `j` is `n + r + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
