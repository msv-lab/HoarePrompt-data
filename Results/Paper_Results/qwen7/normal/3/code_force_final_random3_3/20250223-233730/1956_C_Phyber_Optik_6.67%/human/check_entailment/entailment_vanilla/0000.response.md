Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns.
2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calculates the sum of the matrix and the number of operations required.
   - The logic to calculate the sum and the number of operations is as follows:
     - The sum of the matrix is calculated as the sum of the first \(i \times n\) elements for the first \(r\) rows, where \(r\) is determined such that \(n \times (n + 1) / 2 > i \times n\).
     - The number of operations is \(n + r\), where \(r\) is the number of full rows plus one additional row.
   - The operations are printed in the form specified, alternating between row and column permutations until the required number of operations is reached.
3. **Verification**:
   - The logic to calculate the sum and the number of operations seems correct based on the problem constraints.
   - The operations are correctly formatted and within the limit of \(2n\).

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix and perform the required operations.

Correctness: **True**
