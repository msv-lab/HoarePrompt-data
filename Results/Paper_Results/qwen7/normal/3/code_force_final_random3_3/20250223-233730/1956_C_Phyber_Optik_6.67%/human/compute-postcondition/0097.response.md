Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: `j` is 3, `n` is at least 2.
2. The expression `j % n` calculates the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.
3. Since `j` is 3 and `n` is at least 2, let's consider the possible values for `n`:
   - If `n` is 2, then `3 % 2` equals 1.
   - If `n` is any other number greater than 2, the result will still be 1 because 3 is less than any such `n`, so the remainder will always be 3 itself, but since the modulus operation with a larger divisor will give the same result as the divisor minus the remainder, it will still be 1.
4. Therefore, regardless of the specific value of `n` (as long as it is at least 2), `j % n` will always be 1.
5. The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the next print statement will be on the same line, separated by a space.

Output: **2 1**
