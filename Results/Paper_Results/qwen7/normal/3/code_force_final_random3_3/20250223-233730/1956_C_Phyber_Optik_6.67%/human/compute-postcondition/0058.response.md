Output State: **`sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is 1, `j` is `n + 3`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sum` by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since `sum` was initially 0, after the operation, `sum` becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables (`r`, `j`, `t`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` also remains valid as no changes were made to `n` or `i` that would affect this inequality.
