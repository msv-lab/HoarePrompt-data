Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` (exclusive), meaning `i` will take values from `1` to `n`.

4. **Check the initial value of `i`**:
   - The loop starts with `i = n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[1, n + 1)`.
   - Since `i` starts at `n`, it is already outside this range unless `n` is `0`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - If `n` is `0`, then `i` will never enter the loop because the range would be `[1, 1)`, which is empty.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute.

6. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `i` should be `1` to start the loop.
   - `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is 0, `t` is `t - n * n`, `i` is 1, `sum` is 0**
