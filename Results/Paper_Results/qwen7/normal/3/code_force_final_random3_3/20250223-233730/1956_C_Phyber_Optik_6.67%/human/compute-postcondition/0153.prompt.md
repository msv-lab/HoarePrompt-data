Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, where `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    sum, r = 0, 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
            r = i
            sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
        else:
            sum += i * n
    print(sum, n + r)
    for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
        if j <= n:
            print(1, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        else:
            print(2, j % n, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`. For each iteration, if `j` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `1 j` followed by a range from `1` to `n`. If `j` is greater than `n`, it prints `2 (j % n)` followed by the same range. After all iterations, `j` will be `n + r + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, and `sum` remains `0` because the problem statement does not indicate any changes to `sum` within the loop body. Therefore, the final values are `j = n + r + 1`, `n` as initially provided, `r` as initially provided, and `sum = 0`.

Output State: j = n + r + 1, n = initial n, r = initial r, sum = 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `j` is `n + r + 2`, which simplifies to `2n + 2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The value of `r` is `n`. The value of `t` is reduced by `n` for each iteration, so after `n` iterations, `t` will be `t - n * n`. The value of `i` is `n` after the loop completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` is at least 1, `r` is either `i` or 3 depending on the previous values of `i`, `t` is reduced by `n * n` for each iteration, and `sum` is `3 * n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` since it is incremented by `3 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
