Output: **1 2 3 ... n**

Explanation: 
- The initial state tells us that `j` is 3, but this variable is not used in the `print` statement.
- The variable `n` is at least 2, meaning it can take any integer value greater than or equal to 2.
- The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.
- Since `n` is at least 2, the minimum output would be "1 2" if `n` were 2, but it could be longer depending on the actual value of `n`.

Given the information, the precise output cannot be determined without knowing the exact value of `n`, but it will always be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive.
