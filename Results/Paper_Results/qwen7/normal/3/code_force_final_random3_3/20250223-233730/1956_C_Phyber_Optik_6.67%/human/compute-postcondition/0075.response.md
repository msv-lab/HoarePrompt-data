Output State: The value of `sum` will be the sum of `i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, plus `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. The variable `r` will be set to `n`, `j` will be `n + r + 2` which simplifies to `2n + 2`, `t` will be `t - n`, and `i` will be `n` after the loop completes. The variable `n` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

In simpler terms, the final value of `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each `i` up to `n` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n`. The variable `r` will be `n`, `j` will be `2n + 2`, `t` will be reduced by `n`, and `i` will be `n`. The variable `n` will stay the same as no operations modify it.
