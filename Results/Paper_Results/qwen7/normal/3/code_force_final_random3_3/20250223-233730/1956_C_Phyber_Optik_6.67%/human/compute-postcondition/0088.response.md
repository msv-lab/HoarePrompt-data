Based on the given initial state and the print statement, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Recap**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `r` is some initial value.
   - The condition `j` is less than or equal to `n + r` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

2. **Print Statement Analysis**:
   - The print statement is `print(1, j, end=' ')`.
   - This statement will print the integer `1`, followed by the value of `j`, with no newline (`end=' '`).

3. **Values to be Printed**:
   - The integer `1` is explicitly provided.
   - The value of `j` is explicitly stated to be 2.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be `1 2`.

Output: **1 2**
