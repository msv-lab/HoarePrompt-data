Output: **2, 1**

Explanation:
- `j` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is at least 1 but its exact value is not specified. However, since `j % n` needs to be computed and `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the condition `j > n` to hold true.
- The expression `j % n` computes the remainder when `j` (which is 1) is divided by `n`. Since `j` is 1, the remainder will always be 1 regardless of the value of `n` (as long as `n` is greater than 1).
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the next print statement will be on the same line with a space after the current print.

Therefore, the output will be `2, 1`.
