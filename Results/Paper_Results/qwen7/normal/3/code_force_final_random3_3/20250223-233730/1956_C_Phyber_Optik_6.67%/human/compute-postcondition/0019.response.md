Output State: **`sum` is either 0 + n * (n + 1) // 2 or 2 * n, depending on whether the condition n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n holds true; `i` is 3; `r` is 3**

Explanation: The code `r = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `r`. The values of `sum` and the condition checking whether `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
