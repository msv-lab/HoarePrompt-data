Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is defined as `2 * n + 2`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `r` must be at least `n + 1`.

2. **Value of `j`**:
   - Since `n` must be at least 1, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 1.
   - Substituting `n = 1` into the formula for `j`: 
     \[
     j = 2 * 1 + 2 = 4
     \]
   - Therefore, `j` is 4.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(1, j, end=' ')`.
   - This will print the number 1 followed by the value of `j` with no newline at the end (`end=' '`).

Given this analysis, the output will be:

Output: **1 4**
