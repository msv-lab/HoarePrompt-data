Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving two integers \( t \) and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on specific conditions and prints the sum along with certain values. It also prints a sequence of numbers in a particular format. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final state of the variables \( j \), \( n \), and \( r \) as described in the annotation.**
