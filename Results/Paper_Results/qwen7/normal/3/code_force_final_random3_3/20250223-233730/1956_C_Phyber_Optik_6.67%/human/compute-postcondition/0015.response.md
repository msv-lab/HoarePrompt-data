Output State: **`sum` is either 0 + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * i * n or 2 * n + 2 * i * n, depending on whether the condition n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n holds true; `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `sum += i * n` updates the value of `sum` by adding `i * n` to its current value. Initially, `sum` is either `0 + n * (n + 1) // 2` or `2 * n`, depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`. After the code executes, `sum` will be updated to `sum + 2 * n * i`, where `i` is initially 2, so `i` becomes 3 after the operation. The condition and the value of `r` remain unchanged.
