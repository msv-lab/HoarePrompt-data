Output State: **`j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is `i`, `t` is `t - n * n`, `i` is 2, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, and the current value of `i` is less than `(n * (n + 1) // 2)` divided by `n`.**

Explanation: The code `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the value of `sum` by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since `n` must be at least 1, the expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. All other variables (`j`, `r`, `t`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition on `i` also remains valid as no operation affects it.
