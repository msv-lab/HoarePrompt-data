### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the example cases.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to perform operations on an array \(a\) of length \(n\).
- Each operation involves selecting an index \(i\), inserting \(a_i + i\) into a set \(S\), and deleting \(a_i\) from \(a\).
- After \(n\) operations, \(a\) will be empty.
- Finally, we need to construct an array \(b\) from \(S\) in decreasing order and find the lexicographically largest possible \(b\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \(n\) and the array \(a\).

2. **Processing the Array**:
   - The program increments each element of \(a\) by its index plus one.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each value in the modified array.
   - It converts the modified array to a set to remove duplicates.
   - It sorts the set in descending order to form the initial array \(b\).

3. **Generating the Lexicographically Largest \(b\)**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array and tries to adjust the values to maximize the lexicographical order.
   - It handles cases where there are multiple occurrences of the same value by ensuring that the largest possible values are selected for the set \(S\).

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` processes the array \(a\) and generates the lexicographically largest array \(b\).
- It ensures that the largest possible values are selected for the set \(S\) and adjusts the values to maximize the lexicographical order.

#### Example Case Analysis:
- **Input**:
  ```
  3
  2
  2 1
  5
  1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
  3
  6 4 8
  ```

- **Output**:
  ```
  3 2 
  1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
  11 7 6 
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - For the first test case, the modified array is \([3, 2]\). The program correctly outputs \([3, 2]\).
  - For the second test case, the modified array is \([101, 102, 103, 1000001, 1000000001]\). The program correctly outputs the lexicographically largest array.
  - For the third test case, the modified array is \([7, 6, 11]\). The program correctly outputs \([11, 7, 6]\).

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate the lexicographically largest array \(b\). It handles the case of duplicates and ensures that the largest possible values are selected for the set \(S\). The program's approach is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem.
