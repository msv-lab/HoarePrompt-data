Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the value `adv`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `adv`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j < adv`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `adv` must be greater than 0.
   - `cnt` and `cur` should be such that they allow `adv` to be greater than 0.
   - `ans` now contains an additional element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be equal to the number of iterations completed so far.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `j + 1`.
   - `adv` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `adv` stays the same.

5. **Updating the State**:
   - `adv` remains greater than 0.
   - `cnt` and `cur` remain such that they allow `adv` to be greater than 0.
   - `ans` now contains an additional element, so the new element added in this iteration would be `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`adv` must be greater than 0, `cnt` and `cur` should be such that they allow `adv` to be greater than 0, `ans` now contains an additional element which is `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`**.
