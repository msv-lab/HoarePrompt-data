Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` now has `n` elements where the last element is `ans[0] - 1` and all other elements remain the same, `counter` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is the last element of `ans` decreased by 1.
- Initially, `ans` has `n` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j) - 1` for `j` in the range of `adv`, and the last element is decremented by 1 again.
- After appending `ans[-1] - 1` to `ans`, the last element of `ans` changes to `ans[0] - 1`.
- All other elements in `ans` remain unchanged.
- The values of `cur`, `cnt`, and `counter` remain the same as they were not affected by the code.
