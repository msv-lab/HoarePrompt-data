Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `adv`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `adv`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is a list containing one additional element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
   - `a` retains its original value.
   - `j` is `j + 1`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `adv`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `a` retains its original value.
   - `j` needs to be adjusted to `j + 2` (since it was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < adv`, so `j` must be less than `adv`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is a list containing one additional element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a` retains its original value, `j` is `j + 2`**.
