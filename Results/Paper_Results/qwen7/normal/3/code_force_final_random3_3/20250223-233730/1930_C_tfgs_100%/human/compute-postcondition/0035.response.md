Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and `adv`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j` and `adv`**:
   - From the given state before the loop, we know that `j` is set to `adv - 1`.
   - The value of `adv` is set to `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from `0` to `adv` (inclusive).

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j = adv - 1`, we need to ensure that `j` is within the range `[0, adv]`.
   - The value of `adv` is already determined based on the initial state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `adv`.

**State after adjustment**:
- `j` should be `adv - 1` (the initial value).
- `adv` should be `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)` (the value determined before the loop).

So, the final state is:

**State: **`j` is `adv - 1`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`**.
