Output State: **`cur` is `cur + counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `ans` now contains `n` elements, and each element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j) - 1` for `j` in the range of `adv`. If `i > 0`, then `adv` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cur` by adding `counter[a[i]]` to its current value. The values of `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states, and the condition for `adv` remains the same as well.
