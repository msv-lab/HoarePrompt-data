Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `a[2]` is increased by 6 (since `a[i]` which is `a[3]` is increased by `i + 1` which is `3 + 1 = 4`).**

This means that the value of `a[2]` has been updated by adding 4 to its original value, while all other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
