Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `adv`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < adv`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `adv` must be greater than 0.
   - `cnt` and `cur` should be such that they allow `adv` to be greater than 0.
   - `ans` now contains an additional element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs as long as `j < adv`, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was equal to `adv - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will be `adv` (since `j` starts from 0).
   - `adv` remains the same unless modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, `adv` stays the same.
   - `cnt` and `cur` should still satisfy the condition that allows `adv` to be greater than 0.
   - `ans` will contain an additional element, which means it will have `len(ans) + 1` elements. The new element added will be `a[i - 1] - adv - 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `adv` remains the same.
   - `j` is now `adv`.
   - `cnt` and `cur` should still allow `adv` to be greater than 0.
   - `ans` will have `len(ans) + 1` elements, and the new element will be `a[i - 1] - adv - 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`adv` must be greater than 0, `cnt` and `cur` should be such that they allow `adv` to be greater than 0, `ans` now contains `len(ans) + 1` elements, and the new element is `a[i - 1] - adv - 1`**.
