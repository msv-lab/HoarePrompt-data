Output State: **`adv` is 0, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `cur` remains unchanged, `ans` now contains `n - 1` elements, and each element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j) - 1` for `j` in the range of `adv`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt -= adv` subtracts the value of `adv` from `cnt`. Given that the initial state required `adv` to be greater than 0, after executing this line, `adv` becomes 0. Since `adv` is now 0, the loop that was dependent on finding a valid `adv` value greater than 0 can no longer continue, and thus the loop terminates. The values of `cnt` and `cur` remain unchanged, and `ans` is fully populated with `n - 1` elements as per the initial conditions.
