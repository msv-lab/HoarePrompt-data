Output State: **`j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) - adv`, `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j)`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `cur` is `cur - adv`.**

Explanation: The code `cur -= adv` simply subtracts `adv` from `cur`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `j`, `adv`, `ans`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that `cur` is now `cur - adv`.
