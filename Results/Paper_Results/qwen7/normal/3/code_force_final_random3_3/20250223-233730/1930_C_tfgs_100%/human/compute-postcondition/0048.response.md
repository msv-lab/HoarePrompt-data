Output State: **`cur` is `cur + counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[adv - 1] - (adv - 1 - j)`, `a` remains unchanged, `j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) - adv`, and `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `cur += counter[a[i]]` updates the value of `cur` by adding the value of `counter[a[i]]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state, including `cnt`, `ans`, `a`, `j`, `adv`, and `counter`.
