Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the assignment operation. Therefore, the value of `t` stays within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
