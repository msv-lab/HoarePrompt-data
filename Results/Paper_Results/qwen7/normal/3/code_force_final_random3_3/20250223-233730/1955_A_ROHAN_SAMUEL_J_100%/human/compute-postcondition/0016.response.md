Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an even number.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer.
- \(2 \times a \geq b\).

The expression `n // 2 * b` will be evaluated. Here, `n // 2` represents integer division of `n` by 2, which results in half of `n` rounded down to the nearest integer since `n` is even. Multiplying this result by `b` gives the final value.

Given these conditions, the exact value of `n // 2` depends on the specific value of `n`, but it will always be a non-negative integer. The value of `b` is also known but not specified further.

Therefore, the print statement will output the product of half of `n` (rounded down) and `b`.

Output: **n // 2 * b (where n // 2 is the integer division of n by 2 and b is an integer)**
