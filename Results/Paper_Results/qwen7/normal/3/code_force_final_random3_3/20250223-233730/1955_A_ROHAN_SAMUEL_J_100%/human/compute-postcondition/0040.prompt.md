Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if n % 2:
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b + a)
    elif 2 * a < b:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print(n // 2 * b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, and `b` is an integer. If `n` is odd and 2 * `a` is less than `b`, then `b` remains unchanged. If `n` is odd and 2 * `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to 2 * `a`. If `n` is even, no change is made to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input. Regardless of the condition, the postcondition remains unchanged, meaning the condition \(2a < b\) does not affect the values of the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as described, and the number of remaining iterations is `int(input()) - 1`. Regardless of the condition, the value of `a` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
