You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.

        elif 2 * a < b:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then processes each test case using a loop that runs `t` times.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**:
   - For each test case, the program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd (`if n % 2`):
     - If `n` is odd, it further checks if the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
       - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price).
       - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price (`n // 2 * b + a`).
   - If `n` is even, it directly checks if the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price).
     - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b` (cost of buying all yogurts at the promotion price).

### Verification with Example Cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
     - Print `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
     - Print `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
     - Print `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
     - Print `n // 2 * b = 2 * 11 = 22`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. All the example cases provided in the problem statement are handled correctly by the program.
