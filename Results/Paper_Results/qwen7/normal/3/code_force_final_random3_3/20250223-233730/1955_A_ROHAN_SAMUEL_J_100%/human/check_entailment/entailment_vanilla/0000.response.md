Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation Logic:**
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`):
     - It checks if buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper than buying them individually.
       - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying two yogurts for `b` is cheaper than buying them individually for `2 * a`. Therefore, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying `n // 2` pairs at the promotional price and the remaining one at the regular price).
       - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually).
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`):
     - It directly checks if buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper than buying them individually.
       - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually).
       - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The logic handles both odd and even values of `n` correctly.
   - The condition `2 * a < b` is checked appropriately to decide whether to use the promotional price or individual prices.

### Testing with Provided Examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the cost is `2 * 5 = 10`.
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, the cost is `2 * 5 + 5 = 15`.
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, the cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
