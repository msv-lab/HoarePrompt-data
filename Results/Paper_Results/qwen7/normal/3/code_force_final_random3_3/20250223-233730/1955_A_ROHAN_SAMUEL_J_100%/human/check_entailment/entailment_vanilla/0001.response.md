Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then processes each test case using a loop that runs `t` times.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**:
   - For each test case, the program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd (`if n % 2`):
     - If `n` is odd, it further checks if the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
       - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price).
       - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price (`n // 2 * b + a`).
   - If `n` is even, it directly checks if the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price).
     - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b` (cost of buying all yogurts at the promotion price).

### Verification with Example Cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
     - Print `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
     - Print `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
     - Print `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
     - Print `n // 2 * b = 2 * 11 = 22`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. All the example cases provided in the problem statement are handled correctly by the program.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
