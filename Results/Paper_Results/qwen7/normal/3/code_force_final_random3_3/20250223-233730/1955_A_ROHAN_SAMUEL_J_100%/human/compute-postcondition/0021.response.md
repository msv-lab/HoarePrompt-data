Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means that the loop will iterate based on the input value provided by the user.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions given are:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an integer
   - `a` is an integer
   - `b` is an integer
   - If `n` is odd and \(2 \times a\) is less than `b`, then `b` remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is odd and \(2 \times a\) is greater than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to \(2 \times a\).
   - If `n` is even, no change is made to `b`.

3. **Determine the state to be adjusted**: The loop head does not directly involve `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. Instead, it involves reading an input value from the user, which will determine how many times the loop will run. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the number of iterations left, which is represented by the input value.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will run based on the input value, the state to be adjusted is the input value itself. After each iteration, the input value decreases by 1 until it reaches 0.

Given the above reasoning, the state to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration is the input value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer**
