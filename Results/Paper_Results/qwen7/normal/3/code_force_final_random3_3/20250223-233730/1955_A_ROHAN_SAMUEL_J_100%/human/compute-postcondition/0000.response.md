Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**: Since the loop depends on the input from the user, the state before the loop starts must include the condition that ensures the loop can execute. Specifically, the input must provide a valid number of iterations.

3. **Constraints on the Input**: The constraints given are:
   - `t` (the number of test cases) is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as the input is a positive integer. Given the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the input will always be a valid number of iterations.

5. **State Adjustment**: Since the loop depends on the input from the user, and the input must be a valid positive integer within the specified range, we need to ensure that the input is a valid number. 

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should reflect that the input is a valid positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
