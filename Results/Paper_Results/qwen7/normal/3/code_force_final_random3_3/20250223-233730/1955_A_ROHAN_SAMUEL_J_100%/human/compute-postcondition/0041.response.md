Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each `t`, it processes three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30). The function does not return any specific value from within its body but processes each test case according to the given constraints and relationships between the input parameters.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific ranges of integers `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, and performs some unspecified operation or validation based on these inputs without returning a direct result from the function itself.
