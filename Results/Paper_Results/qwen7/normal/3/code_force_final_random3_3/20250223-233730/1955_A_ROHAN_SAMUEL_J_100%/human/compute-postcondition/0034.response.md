Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is the integer input split from the first space, `a` is the integer input split from the second space, `b` is the integer input split from the third space, the number of remaining iterations is `int(input()) - 1`. The value of `a` remains unchanged regardless of the condition.**
