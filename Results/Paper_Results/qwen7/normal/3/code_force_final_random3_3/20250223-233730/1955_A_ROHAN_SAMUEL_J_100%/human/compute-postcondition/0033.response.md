Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n` is the integer input split from the first space.
- `a` is the integer input split from the second space.
- `b` is the integer input split from the third space.
- The number of remaining iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.

The `print` statement is `print(n // 2 * b + a)`.

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. `n // 2`: This is integer division of `n` by 2. It results in the quotient of `n` divided by 2, discarding any remainder.
2. `n // 2 * b`: This multiplies the result of the integer division by `b`.
3. `n // 2 * b + a`: Finally, this adds `a` to the result of the previous multiplication.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not specified, we will represent them as placeholders in the output.

Output: **n // 2 * b + a (where n, a, and b are the respective integer inputs split from the first, second, and third spaces)**
