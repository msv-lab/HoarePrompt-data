You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the following list contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `shapes` will be the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all unique elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. For each test case, it counts the number of unique integers that appear at least three times in the list and prints the total count. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` which represents the number of sticks.
   - It then reads a list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - A dictionary `d` is used to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` is used to store unique stick lengths.

3. **Calculating Maximum Polygons:**
   - For each unique stick length in `pl`, the program checks if there are at least 3 sticks of that length.
   - If so, it calculates how many polygons can be formed using those sticks and adds this to the total number of polygons `shapes`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of polygons for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The dictionary `d` correctly counts the occurrences of each stick length.
   - The list `pl` stores unique stick lengths, ensuring no stick length is counted multiple times in the same test case.

3. **Calculating Maximum Polygons:**
   - The logic for calculating the number of polygons is flawed. The program assumes that every set of 3 sticks of the same length can form a triangle, but it does not account for the possibility of forming larger polygons (like squares, pentagons, etc.) with more than 3 sticks of the same length.
   - The program should calculate the number of complete polygons (triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.) that can be formed, not just the number of triangles.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the result for each test case, but the calculation method is incorrect.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 1`
  - Output: `0`
  - Correct Output: `0` (No polygon can be formed)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `2 1 1`
  - Output: `0`
  - Correct Output: `0` (No polygon can be formed)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `6 2 2 3 3 3 3`
  - Output: `1`
  - Correct Output: `1` (A square can be formed with 4 sticks of length 3)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `9 4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`
  - Output: `2`
  - Correct Output: `2` (A pentagon with side length 2 and a square with side length 4 can be formed)

### Conclusion:

The program incorrectly calculates the number of polygons that can be formed. It only considers triangles and does not account for larger polygons. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
