Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` set to `1`, and the current value of `i` is such that `d.get(i)` returns `1`.**

This means that the dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
