Based on the initial state provided:

- `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all unique elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `pl` contains all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
- `w` remains greater than 0, but `w` itself is not directly involved in calculating `shapes`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the calculation of `shapes`. Since the exact values of `palka` and `d` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, we know that `shapes` is derived from the elements of `pl` according to the specified formula.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `shapes`, which is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all unique elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of d[j] // 3 for all unique elements j in pl where d[j] >= 3)**
