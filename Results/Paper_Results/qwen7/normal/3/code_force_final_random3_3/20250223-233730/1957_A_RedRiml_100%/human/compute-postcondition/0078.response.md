Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with `d[i+1]` incremented by 1, `i` is `i+1`, `pl` contains the element `i+1`**.

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Since `i` is `i+1`, the key in the dictionary is `i+1`. The value of `i` is updated to `i+1`, and `pl` still contains the element `i+1`.
