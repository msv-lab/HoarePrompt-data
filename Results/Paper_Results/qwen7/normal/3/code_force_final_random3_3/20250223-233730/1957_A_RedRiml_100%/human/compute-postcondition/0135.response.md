Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the dictionary `d` will contain counts of each integer in the list `palka`, the list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and the variable `w` remains greater than 0.**

In more detail, the final state will be as follows:
- The dictionary `d` will have keys corresponding to each unique integer in `palka`, with the values representing the count of how many times each integer appears in `palka`.
- The list `pl` will be a sorted list of all unique integers from `palka`, where each integer is added to `pl` only once, in the order they first appear in `palka`.
- The variable `w` will retain its initial value, which is greater than 0.
- The variable `shapes` will be updated based on the current state of `d` and `pl`, specifically as the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` such that `d[j] >= 3`. However, since the question asks for the final state of the variables after all iterations, we do not need to explicitly state the value of `shapes` unless it is directly affected by the loop, which it isn't in this case.
