Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is the first element of `pl`.
- `pl` must contain at least one element.
- Either `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, or `shapes` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each element `j` in `pl`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `pl`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was the first element of `pl`, and `pl` contained at least one element.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be the second element of `pl`.

2. **Adjust the State:**
   - `j` will now be the second element of `pl`.
   - `pl` must still contain at least one element (since it had at least one element before and we are only moving to the next element).

3. **Adjust the Postcondition:**
   - The postcondition for the next iteration will depend on the value of the new `j` (the second element of `pl`).
   - If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` will be increased by `d[j] // 3`.
   - If `d[j]` is less than 3, `shapes` will remain unchanged.

### Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration
- `j` will be the second element of `pl`.
- `pl` must contain at least one element (which it does, since it had at least one element before and we are only moving to the next element).
- The postcondition will depend on the value of the new `j`.

### Updated State
State: **`j` is the second element of `pl`, `pl` must contain at least one element, and either `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, or `shapes` remains unchanged.**
