Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with the key `i` and value `1`, `i` is the next element in `palka`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The variable `i` remains unchanged from its previous state, which is defined as being the next element in `palka`. All other information from the initial state remains valid and is included in the output state.
