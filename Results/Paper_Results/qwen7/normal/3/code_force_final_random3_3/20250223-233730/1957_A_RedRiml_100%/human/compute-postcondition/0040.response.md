Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `pl`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `pl`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is the first element of `pl`.
   - `pl` must contain at least one element.
   - Either `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, or `shapes` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `pl` must contain at least one element, and `j` is the first element of `pl`, removing `j` from `pl` will leave `pl` with at least one element (assuming `pl` had more than one element initially).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `pl` must still contain at least one element, and `j` will be the new first element of `pl`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will now be the second element of `pl`.
   - `pl` must still contain at least one element.

6. **Consider the Postcondition**:
   - The postcondition for the loop body is that `shapes` is either increased by `d[j] // 3` (where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3) or remains unchanged.
   - This postcondition does not change the requirement for `pl` to contain at least one element, but it does affect the value of `shapes`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `j` is the second element of `pl`, `pl` must contain at least one element, and either `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, or `shapes` remains unchanged.**
