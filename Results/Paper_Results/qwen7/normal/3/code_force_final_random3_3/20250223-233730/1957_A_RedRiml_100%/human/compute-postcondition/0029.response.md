Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers with `i` being the third element, `pl` is a list containing at least one element `i` with `i` appended, `d[i]` is incremented by 1 for each key `i` not in `pl` before the if statement, and for keys already in `pl`, `d[i]` remains 1, `pl` now contains `i` as its last element.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `i` was already present in `pl`, appending it again does not change the fact that `i` is in `pl`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
