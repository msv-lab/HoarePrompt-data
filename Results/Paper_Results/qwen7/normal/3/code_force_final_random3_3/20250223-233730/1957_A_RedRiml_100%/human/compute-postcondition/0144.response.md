Postcondition: **`shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`, `pl` must have at least one element, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the postcondition of the if part directly becomes the overall postcondition. The `shapes` variable is increased by `d[j] // 3`, and `pl` must have at least one element, which are the conditions specified in both the precondition and the if part.
