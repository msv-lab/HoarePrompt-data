Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(w):
    ln = int(input())
    palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pl = []
    d = {}
    for i in palka:
        if d.get(i) == None:
            d[i] = 1
        else:
            d[i] += 1
        if i not in pl:
            pl.append(i)
    shapes = 0
    for j in pl:
        if d[j] >= 3:
            shapes += d[j] // 3
    print(shapes)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `shapes` is increased by the sum of `d[j] // 3` for every `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` such that `d[j] >= 3`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that contains all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `shapes` will be the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all unique elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3. The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and the variable `w` remains greater than 0; `shapes` is now the final calculated value based on the condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
