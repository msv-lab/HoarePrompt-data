Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `pl`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `pl` contains at least one element.

3. **Analyze the postcondition from the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is the second element of `pl`.
   - `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3` since `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `pl` must contain at least one element.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the second element of `pl` after the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` will be the third element of `pl` (assuming `pl` still contains at least one element).
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `pl` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `j` is now the third element of `pl`, and `pl` must still contain at least one element.

**State: **`j` is the third element of `pl`, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3` since `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, and `pl` must contain at least one element**.
