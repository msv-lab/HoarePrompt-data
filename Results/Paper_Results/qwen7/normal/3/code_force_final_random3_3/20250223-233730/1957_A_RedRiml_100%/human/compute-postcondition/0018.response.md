Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in palka:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `w` is an input integer.
   - `ln` is an input integer.
   - `palka` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `pl` is a list containing at least one element `i`.
   - `d` is a dictionary where for each key `i` not in `pl` before the if statement, `d[i]` is incremented by 1, and for keys already in `pl`, `d[i]` remains 1.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element `i` in `palka`, the value of `i` changes with each iteration.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be the first element of `palka`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the second element of `palka`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `w` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ln` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `palka` remains the same list but with `i` now being the second element.
   - `pl` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `d` may change based on the new value of `i`, but since the problem does not specify how `d` changes within the loop body, we assume `d` remains the same unless explicitly modified.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers with `i` being the second element, `pl` is a list containing at least one element `i`, `d` is a dictionary where for each key `i` not in `pl` before the if statement, `d[i]` is incremented by 1, and for keys already in `pl`, `d[i]` remains 1.**
