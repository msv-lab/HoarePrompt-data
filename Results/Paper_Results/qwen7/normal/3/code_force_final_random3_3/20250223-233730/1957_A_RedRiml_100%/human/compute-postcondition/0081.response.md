Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with the key `i+1` updated or added, `i` is `i+1`, `pl` contains the element `i+1`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is `i+1` according to the initial state) to the list `pl`. The dictionary `d` is updated or remains unchanged based on whether the key `i+1` already exists. If it does not exist, `d[i+1]` is set to `1`. If it does exist, `d[i+1]` is incremented by `1`. The value of `i` is updated to `i+1`, and `i+1` is appended to `pl`.
