Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in palka:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `palka`**:
   - `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input. Since `palka` is updated after the loop, its initial state before the loop is empty.
   - `i` is an element from the list `palka`. For the loop to execute, `palka` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `palka` is initially empty, the loop will not execute unless `palka` contains at least one element.
   - The variable `i` will take on the value of each element in `palka` during each iteration of the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `palka` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
- `i` will be the first element in `palka` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed is:

**State: **`palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`**.
