Postcondition: **`shapes` is adjusted to either `3 * (d[j] // 3)` if `d[j] >= 3`, or remains as `2 * (d[j] // 3)`. `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that must contain at least two unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and `j` is the next element in `pl`.**
