Postcondition: `palka` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the second element in the list `palka`, and `d[i]` is either set to 1 or increased by 1 depending on whether the key `i` existed in the dictionary `d` before the execution of the if-else block. If `i` is not in `pl`, `d[i]` is set to 1; otherwise, `d[i]` is increased by 1.
