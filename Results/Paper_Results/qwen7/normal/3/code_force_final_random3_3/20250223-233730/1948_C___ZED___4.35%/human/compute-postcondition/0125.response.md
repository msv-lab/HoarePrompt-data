Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `k` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `k = 0` to `k < n` with a step of `2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i_current + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
   - `k` is 0
   - `a` is a new string input by the user
   - `b` is the new input string
   - If the current value of `b[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is `False`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `k` starts from 0 and increments by 2, the next value of `k` would be `0 + 2 = 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `k` (which is now 0) must be less than `n`.

5. **Ensure the other variables remain unchanged**:
   - `i` remains `i_current + 1`
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 2
   - `a` remains the new string input by the user
   - `b` remains the new input string
   - `no_path` remains `False` as long as `b[k]` is not '>', where `k` is now 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, and if the current value of `b[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is `False`**.
