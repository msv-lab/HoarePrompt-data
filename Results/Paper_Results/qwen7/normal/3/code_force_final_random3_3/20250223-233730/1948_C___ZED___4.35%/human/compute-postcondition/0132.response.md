Postcondition: `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` must be greater than 4, `k` is 4, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, and `no_path` remains `False` if `b[k]` is not `'> '`.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `b[k] != '>'` is true or false, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain as specified in the if part, and `no_path` stays `False`.
