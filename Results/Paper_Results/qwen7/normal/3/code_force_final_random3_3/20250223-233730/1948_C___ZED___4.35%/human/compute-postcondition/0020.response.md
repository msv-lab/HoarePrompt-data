Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for k in range(0, n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - If `b[2]` is not '>', then `no_path` remains False.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `k` starting from 0 up to but not including `n` in steps of 2. Therefore, the loop will run as long as `k < n`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `k` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `k` starts from 0 and increments by 2 each time, the next value of `k` would be `2 + 2 = 4`.
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must be less than `n`. Given that `k` is now 4, `n` must be greater than 4.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `k` will be 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.
   - The postcondition about `no_path` and `b[2]` does not change based on the loop itself, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `k` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, and if `b[2]` is not '>', then `no_path` remains False.**
