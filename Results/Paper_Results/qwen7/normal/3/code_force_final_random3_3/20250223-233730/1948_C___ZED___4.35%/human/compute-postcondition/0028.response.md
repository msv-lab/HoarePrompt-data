Output State: **`no_path` is True, `k` is equal to `n-1` (the last even number less than or equal to `n`), `n` must be greater than 0, and `b[k]` is not '>' since `no_path` is False.**

Explanation: The code sets `no_path` to `True`. This changes the value of `no_path` from `False` to `True`. All other variables (`k`, `n`, and `b[k]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
