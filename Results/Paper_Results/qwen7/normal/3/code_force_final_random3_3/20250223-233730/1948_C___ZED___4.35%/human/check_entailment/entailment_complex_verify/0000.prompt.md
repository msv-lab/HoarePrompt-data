You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    #State: Output State: All test cases have been processed, and for each test case, one of the following outputs has been printed: 'YES' or 'NO'. The variables `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated according to the loop's logic, but their final values are not specified as they depend on the input for each test case. The variable `no_path` has been determined based on the conditions inside the loop and affects the final output.
    #
    #In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the program has processed all given test cases and printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each one based on the conditions specified in the loop. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path` reflect the outcome of processing each test case, but without specific inputs, we cannot determine their exact final values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) and an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 2⋅10^5, \( n \) is even). For each test case, it reads two strings of length \( n \), each consisting only of '<' and/or '>'. Based on the conditions specified in the code, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the correct output ('YES' or 'NO') is printed for each one.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to check if the robot can reach the last column (2, n) when the arrows in the second row do not consistently point to the right. Here is an example to demonstrate this:

Consider the following input:
```
4
4
>>><
><>>
```

In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, 4). The path would be:
1. Move right to (1, 2).
2. Follow the arrow '<' to (1, 1).
3. Move right to (1, 2).
4. Follow the arrow '>' to (2, 2).
5. Move right to (2, 3).
6. Follow the arrow '<' to (2, 2).
7. Move right to (2, 3).
8. Follow the arrow '>' to (2, 4).

However, the program incorrectly prints 'NO' because it only checks if `b[-2]` is `'>` and if `n == 1`. It does not properly handle the scenario where the robot can navigate through the grid using a combination of moves and arrow directions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
