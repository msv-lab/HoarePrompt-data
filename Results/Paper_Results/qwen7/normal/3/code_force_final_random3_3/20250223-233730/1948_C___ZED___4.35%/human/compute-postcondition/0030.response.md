Based on the initial state provided:

- `no_path` is `True`
- `k` is `1`
- `n` must be greater than `0`
- `b[1]` is not `'> '` (which implies `no_path` would be `False`, but since `no_path` is explicitly `True`, this condition does not affect `no_path` directly)

The print statement is:
```python
print(k)
```

Given that `k` is explicitly stated to be `1`, the print statement will output the value of `k`.

Output: **1**
