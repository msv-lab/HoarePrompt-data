Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case where `n` is odd correctly. The problem states that `n` is even, but the code does not account for this properly.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The logic for checking if there's a path to `(2, n)` is flawed. The condition `if b[-2] != '>'` only checks the second-to-last column of the second row, which is insufficient.
   - The loop for checking the path in the first row is also incorrect. It should check the entire row, not just every other column.

3. **Print Statement**: The `print(k)` statement inside the loop is unnecessary and incorrect. It should be removed.

4. **Final Decision**: The final decision to print 'YES' or 'NO' is based on incomplete logic. The program needs to ensure the robot can reach `(2, n)` by following the arrows correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the last column can be reached
        if b[-1] != '>':
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if there's a path from (1, 1) to (2, n)
        can_reach = True
        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index, move vertically
                if b[i] != '>':
                    can_reach = False
                    break
            else:  # Odd index, move horizontally
                if a[i] != '>':
                    can_reach = False
                    break
        
        if can_reach:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the robot can reach `(2, n)` by following the arrows correctly and handles the edge cases appropriately.
