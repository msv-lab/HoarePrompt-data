Based on the initial state provided:

- `no_path` is `False`
- `k` is `5`
- `n` must be greater than `3`
- `b[1]` is not `'>'`
- The current value of `a[5]` remains unchanged unless `a[5]` is not `'>'`, in which case it will be updated to a non `'>'` value.

The `print(k)` statement will simply print the value of `k`.

Output: **5**
