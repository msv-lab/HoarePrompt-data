Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `e` is 0, `l` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, `y` is 100000000, `i` is 0. If `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then the condition is met as stated. If `nums[i]` is not greater than `x`, the condition does not change the values of the variables.
