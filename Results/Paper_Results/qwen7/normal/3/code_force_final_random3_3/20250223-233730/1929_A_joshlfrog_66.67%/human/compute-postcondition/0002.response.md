Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `e` is 0, `l` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `l` now holds the integer value entered by the user. The values of `t` and `e` remain unchanged from their initial states.
