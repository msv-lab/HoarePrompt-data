Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 0, `l` is a positive integer, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, `y` is the minimum value between the current `y` and `nums[i]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `x`. The other variables (`t`, `e`, `l`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i`, we only note that `i` is incremented. The value of `x` is updated to be the current value of `nums[i]`, and `y` remains the minimum value between its current value and `nums[i]`.
