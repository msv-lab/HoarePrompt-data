Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` holds the maximum value found in the list `nums`.
- `y` holds the minimum value found in the list `nums`.
- `l` is equal to the length of the list `nums`.
- `i` is equal to `l - 1`.

The expression `x - y` calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Therefore, the print statement will output this difference.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list nums and y is the minimum value in the list nums)**
