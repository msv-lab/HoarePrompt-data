Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `e` is 0.
- `l` is the length of the list `nums`.
- `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`.
- `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.

The print statement `print(x - y)` will output the difference between the maximum value (`x`) and the minimum value (`y`) in the list `nums`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of their definitions. Therefore, the output will be the result of subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value in the list `nums`.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list nums and y is the minimum value in the list nums)**
