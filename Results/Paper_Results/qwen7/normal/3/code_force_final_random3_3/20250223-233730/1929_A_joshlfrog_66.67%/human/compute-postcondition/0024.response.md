Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `l`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in the range from `0` to `l-1`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `e` is 0.
   - `l` is a positive integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.
   - `x` is the value of `nums[i]`.
   - `y` is the minimum value between the original `y` and `nums[i]`. If `nums[i] < y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `x` will be the value of `nums[i]` in the next iteration.
   - `y` will be the minimum value between the current `y` and `nums[i]` (since `y` is updated based on the condition in the loop body).

Given these points, let's summarize the states at the start of the next iteration:

- `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `e` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
- `l` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously `k`, it will now be `k+1`.
- `x` will be the value of `nums[i]` in the next iteration.
- `y` will be the minimum value between the current `y` and `nums[i]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 0, `l` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, `y` is the minimum value between the current `y` and `nums[i]`**.
