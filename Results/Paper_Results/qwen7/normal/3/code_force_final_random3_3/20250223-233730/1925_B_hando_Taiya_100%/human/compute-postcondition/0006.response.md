Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is the maximum of ans and i, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, `n` is less than or equal to x divided by `i`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum between its current value (`ans`) and the value of `i` (which is 1 in this case). Since `ans` was initially 0, it will now be updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
