Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
   - `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i` where `x` is divisible by `i`, and `i` is 1.
   - `i` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = isqrt(x) + 1`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is within this range.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `isqrt(x) + 1`. Since `i` is now 2, we need to check if `2 <= isqrt(x) + 1`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless `2` (the new value of `i`) satisfies the condition `n <= x // 2`. If it does, `ans` will be updated to the maximum of `ans` and `2`.
   - `i` is now 2.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // 2` where `x` is divisible by `2`, and `i` is 2.**
