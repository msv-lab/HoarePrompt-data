Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and all `x // i` for each `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, and `i` is the last integer within this range that satisfies the conditions in the loop body.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i` for every divisor `i` of `x` where `i` ranges from 1 up to the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`. The loop updates `ans` whenever it finds a larger value of `x // i` that meets the condition `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`.
