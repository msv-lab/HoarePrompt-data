Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and 3, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`, which is 3. Since `i` is 3, `ans` will be updated to 3 if its current value is less than 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
