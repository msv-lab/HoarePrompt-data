Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum balance of the problemset. Specifically, the program only checks divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`, but it does not ensure that the number of sub-problems `n` is satisfied. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
12 4
```

The correct output should be `3` because we can split the problem into four sub-problems with difficulties 3, 3, 3, and 3, which gives a GCD of 3. However, the current implementation might fail to find this optimal solution because it does not properly handle the distribution of sub-problems. The program needs to check all possible ways to distribute `n` sub-problems among the divisors of `x`.
