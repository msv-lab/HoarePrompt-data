Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`. The loop runs from `1` to `isqrt(x) + 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
   - `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // 2` (since `x` is divisible by 2).
   - `i` is 2.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `isqrt(x) + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be `3`.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is within the range `1` to `isqrt(x) + 1`.
   - We don't need to update `t`, `x`, `n`, or `ans` because these variables are not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // 2` (since `x` is divisible by 2), and `i` is 3**.
