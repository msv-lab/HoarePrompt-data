Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, which is fine.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - A function `func_1` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is a logical error because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **Reading Test Case Input:**
   - Inside the loop, the program correctly reads the values of `x` and `n` for each test case.

4. **Finding Maximum Balance:**
   - The program attempts to find the maximum balance by iterating through possible divisors of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` or `x // i` can be used as the difficulty of sub-problems.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it considers `i` as a potential answer.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it considers `x // i` as a potential answer.
   - The maximum value found during these checks is stored in `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum balance found for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- The function `func_1` is not being called inside the loop to process the test cases. This means the program does not actually perform any calculations for the test cases.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we need to call `func_1` inside the loop that processes each test case. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import isqrt

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error due to the unused function `func_1`. After fixing this, the program should work correctly according to the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
