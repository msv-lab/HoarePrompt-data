Functionality: **For each test case, the function reads three values: \( t \) (a positive integer between 1 and 10^3), \( x \) (a positive integer between 1 and 10^8), and \( n \) (a positive integer between 1 and \( x \)). It then calculates and prints the maximum value of \( x \div i \) for all integers \( i \) from 1 up to the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to \( x \), where \( i \) satisfies the condition \( n \leq x \div i \) or \( n \leq i \).**
