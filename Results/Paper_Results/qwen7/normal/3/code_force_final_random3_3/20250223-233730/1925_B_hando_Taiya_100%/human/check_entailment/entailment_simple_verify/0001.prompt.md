You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and all `x // i` for each `i` from 1 to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i` is less than or equal to `x`, and `i` is the last integer within this range that satisfies the conditions in the loop body.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: the maximum value of x // i for all valid i where i * i <= x



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program reads an integer `tc` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_1()` but does not pass any arguments to it, which seems incorrect based on the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes no arguments but reads two integers `x` and `n` from input.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It then iterates over a range from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive).
   - For each value `i` in this range, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
     - If `x % i == 0`, it updates `ans` with the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` and updates `ans` accordingly.
     - Similarly, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i` and updates `ans` accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program should read `tc` and handle each test case separately.
   - However, the function `func_1` is called without any arguments, which means it won't be able to access the values of `x` and `n` from the main loop. This is incorrect.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The logic inside `func_1` appears to be correct for finding the maximum GCD (balance) of the sub-problems.
   - It correctly iterates through possible divisors and checks the conditions to update `ans`.

### Conclusion:

The program has a logical error in how it handles test cases. The function `func_1` needs to be called with the correct parameters from the main loop. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd, isqrt

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect because it calls `func_1` without passing the necessary parameters. The corrected version should directly handle the test cases within the main loop.
