Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code execution.
