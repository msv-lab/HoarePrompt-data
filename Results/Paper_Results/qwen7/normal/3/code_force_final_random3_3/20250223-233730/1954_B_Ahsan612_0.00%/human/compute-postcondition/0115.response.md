Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1.
   - `same` is 2 if the current element matches the first element, otherwise it remains 1.
   - `num` is the first element of the list `ar`.
   - `i` is 4.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.
   - Given `i` is currently 4, `i` must be incremented to 5 (or more) for the loop to continue.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `len(ar)`.

4. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - `minn`, `same`, and `num` are not directly involved in the loop condition `i < len(ar)`. Thus, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure `i` is such that the loop can execute one more time, i.e., `i < len(ar)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 4, `i` must be less than `len(ar)` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State: **`minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1, `same` is 2 if the current element matches the first element, otherwise it remains 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, and `i` must be less than `len(ar)`**.
