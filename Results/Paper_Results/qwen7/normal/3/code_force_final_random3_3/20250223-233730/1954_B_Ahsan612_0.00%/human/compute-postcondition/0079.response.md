Output State: **`i` is either 6 or 7; `same` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `same` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or any other integer). Since the initial state does not specify the value of `same`, we assume it starts at 0. After executing `same += 1`, the value of `same` becomes 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still either 6 or 7.
