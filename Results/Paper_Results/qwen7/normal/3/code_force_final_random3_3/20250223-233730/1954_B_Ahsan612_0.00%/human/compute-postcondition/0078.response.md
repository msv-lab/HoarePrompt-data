To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition and the current values of the relevant variables.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

2. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is either 5 or 6.
   - `same` is either 2 (if `ar[4]` equals `num`) or 1 (if `ar[4]` does not equal `num`).
   - `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar`.
   - `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 1.

3. **Determining the Next State**:
   - If `i` is 5, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 6 and still be less than `len(ar)`.
   - If `i` is 6, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 7 and still be less than `len(ar)`.

Given these conditions, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `i` is either 5 or 6, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be incremented to 6 or 7, respectively.
- The values of `same`, `num`, and `minn` do not affect the loop condition directly and do not need to be adjusted.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` must be 6 or 7**
