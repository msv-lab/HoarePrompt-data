Output State: **`i` is 3, `same` is either incremented by 1 if the current value of `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, or remains 1 if it is not, and `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar` depending on the condition.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 2. After executing `i += 1`, `i` becomes 3. The values of `same`, `minn`, `ar`, and `num` remain unchanged because the code only modifies `i`. Therefore, `same` is still either incremented by 1 if `ar[2]` equals `num`, or remains 1 if it does not. `minn` is still the minimum value between infinity and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution. `ar` and `num` retain their initial conditions based on the loop execution.
