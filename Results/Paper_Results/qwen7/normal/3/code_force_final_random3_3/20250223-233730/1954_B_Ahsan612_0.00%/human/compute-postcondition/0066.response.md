Postcondition: `minn` is set to the minimum value between infinity and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, `ar` is a list of integers created from input, `i` is 2, `same` is either incremented by 1 if the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, or remains 1 if the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `num` is now the second element of `ar`.
