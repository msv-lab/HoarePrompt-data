Reasoning:
The provided function attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and tracking the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same element. However, there are a few issues with the logic that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Update of `same` and `num`:**
   - The variable `num` is incorrectly initialized to `ar[0]`, which means it doesn't properly track the current number being processed when a new sequence starts.
   - The variable `same` should be reset only when a new sequence of a different number starts, but the current implementation resets `same` inside the loop without properly updating `num`.

2. **Logic for Finding Minimum Length of Sequences:**
   - The logic for finding the minimum length of sequences of the same number is flawed. It does not correctly identify the minimum length of sequences that would make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array is already non-beautiful or when the minimum sequence length is infinite.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
