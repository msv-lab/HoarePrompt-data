Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, the function determines the sum of n over all test cases and returns it.**

Note: The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given output cases, but it implies processing multiple test cases and returning the cumulative sum of n across all test cases.
