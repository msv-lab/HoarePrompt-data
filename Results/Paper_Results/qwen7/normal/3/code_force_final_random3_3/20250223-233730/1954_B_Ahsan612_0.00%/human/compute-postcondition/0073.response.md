Output State: **`i` is 5, `same` is either incremented by 1 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, or remains 1 if it is not, and `num` is now `ar[5]`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value and `same`. However, the exact value of `same` depends on whether `ar[2]` is equal to `num`. Since `num` is now `ar[5]`, `same` could either be 1 (if `ar[2]` is not equal to `ar[5]`) or 2 (if `ar[2]` is equal to `ar[5]`). The value of `minn` is updated accordingly, but its exact value is not specified without knowing the initial value of `minn` and the condition of `ar[2]` relative to `ar[5]`.
