Postcondition: `i` is either 5 or 6, `same` is at least 1, `minn` is the minimum between `minn` and `same + 1`, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 6. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, then `same` is at least 2, and `minn` is the minimum between `minn` and `same + 1`. Otherwise, `i` becomes either 6 or 7, `same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum between `minn` and 1, and `num` is equal to `ar[i]`.
