Output State: **`i` is either 7 or 8, `num` is `min(minn, same)`, and `same` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` was either 6 or 7. After incrementing, `i` will now be either 7 or 8. The values of `num` and `same` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
