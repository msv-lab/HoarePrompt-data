Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1**.

The code simply reassigns the variable `same` to the value 1, which does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, and `minn` remain unchanged.
