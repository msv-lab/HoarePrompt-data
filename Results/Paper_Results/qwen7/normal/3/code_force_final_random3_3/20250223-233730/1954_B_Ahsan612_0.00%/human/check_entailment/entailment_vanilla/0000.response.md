### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The function `func()` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes variables to track the current sequence length (`same`), the number to which the current sequence is equal (`num`), and the minimum sequence length found (`minn`).
   - It iterates through the array, updating these variables accordingly.
   - After the loop, it checks if `minn` is still infinity (`inf`). If so, it prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for identifying sequences of consecutive identical elements seems correct.
   - However, there are a few issues:
     - The code does not correctly handle the condition where `a_i = a_{i-1}` and `a_i = a_{i+1}`. This is crucial for determining whether the array can be made non-beautiful.
     - The code does not account for the possibility of removing elements to break the beauty condition.
     - The code does not ensure that the array is indeed beautiful before attempting to make it non-beautiful.

4. **Correctness of the Given Code**:
   - The given code does not fully address the problem requirements. It only identifies sequences of consecutive identical elements but does not provide a mechanism to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
