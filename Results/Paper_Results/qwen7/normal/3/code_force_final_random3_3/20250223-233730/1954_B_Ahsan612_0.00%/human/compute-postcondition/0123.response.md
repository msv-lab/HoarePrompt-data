Output State: **`minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1, `same` is 3 if the current element matches the first element, otherwise it is 2, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, and `i` is less than `len(ar)` + 1.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially less than `len(ar)`, after executing `i += 1`, `i` is now less than `len(ar) + 1`. All other variables (`minn`, `same`, `num`) remain unchanged.
