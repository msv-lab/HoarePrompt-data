Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `i` is either 5 or 6.
   - `same` is at least 1.
   - `minn` is the minimum between `minn` and `same`.

3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Given that `i` is either 5 or 6, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Therefore, `len(ar)` must be greater than 6.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` is either 5 or 6, and for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`, `len(ar)` must be greater than 6.

The other states (`same` and `minn`) do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is either 5 or 6, `same` is at least 1, `minn` is the minimum between `minn` and `same`, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 6**
