Output State: **`i` is 5, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[5]`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `same` to 1. Since `same` was previously incremented by 1 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, or remained 1 otherwise, setting `same` to 1 does not change its value. The other variables (`i`, `num`, and `minn`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
