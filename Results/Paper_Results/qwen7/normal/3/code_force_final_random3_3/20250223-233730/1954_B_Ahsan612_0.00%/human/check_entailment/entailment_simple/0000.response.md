Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` processes each test case as specified.
2. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. The variable `same` keeps track of the maximum streak of consecutive identical elements encountered so far.
4. The variable `minn` is initialized to infinity and is updated to the minimum value of `same` whenever a different element is encountered.
5. After processing the entire array, `minn` will hold the minimum streak of consecutive identical elements.
6. If `minn` remains infinity after processing the entire array, it means there was no streak of consecutive identical elements, and thus, the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. In this case, `-1` is printed.
7. Otherwise, the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beauty of the array is `minn`.

Given the logic and the constraints, the function appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
