Output State: **`minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1, `same` is 3 if the current element matches the first element, otherwise it is 2, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but the values of `minn`, `same`, `num`, and the list `ar` remain unchanged from their initial states.
