Output State: `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`, `same` is the total count of consecutive occurrences of `num` throughout the list, `minn` is the minimum value between the initial `minn` (which was infinity) and the maximum value of `same` encountered during the loop, `num` is the last different integer encountered in the list `ar`, and `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

Explanation:
- The loop continues until `i` is no longer less than the length of `ar`. Therefore, once `i` equals the length of `ar`, the loop stops.
- `same` keeps track of the count of consecutive occurrences of `num`. This count is reset to 1 every time `num` changes.
- `minn` is updated to be the minimum value between its previous value (which starts as infinity) and the maximum value of `same` encountered during the loop.
- `num` is updated to the current element in the list whenever `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `same` is reset to 1 in this case.
