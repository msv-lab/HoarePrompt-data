Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n + 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute because `range(0)` generates no values.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop depends on `n` being at least 1, we need to ensure `n` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` should be set to 0 at the start of the loop, as `range(n)` generates values starting from 0 up to (but not including) `n`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

Therefore, the modified state should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
