Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - The loop condition checks if `c[1]` is not equal to `a[1]` or `c[1]` is equal to `b[1]`. If either condition is met, it sets `possible` to True and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `c[1]` is equal to `a[1]`, the loop continues to the next iteration.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop is dependent on `i` and `n`, these are the only variables that need to be adjusted.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` is now 2
- `n` must still be greater than 0

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
