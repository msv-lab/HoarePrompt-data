Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `possible` remains `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of `i`, `n`, and `possible` remain unchanged from their initial states.
