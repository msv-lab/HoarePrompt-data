Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the strings (`n`), and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It initializes a boolean variable `possible` to `False` and iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
4. During the iteration:
   - If the characters at the current index `i` in `a` and `b` are the same, it checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the characters at the current index `i` in `a` and `b` are different, it checks if `c[i]` matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If not, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
5. After the loop, if `possible` is still `False`, it means no template can satisfy the conditions for both `a` and `b` but not for `c`. Otherwise, it prints "YES".
6. The program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement and produces the expected output based on the given examples.

Given the above analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
