Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 0. If `c[1]` is not equal to `a[1]`, then `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `c[1]` is equal to `a[1]` or `c[1]` is equal to `b[1]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
