Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and if the elements at index 0 of arrays `a` and `b` are equal, `possible` remains unchanged and `c[0]` is neither equal to `a[0]` nor `b[0]`. If the elements at index 0 of arrays `a` and `b` are not equal, `c[0]` is set to the value of either `a[0]` or `b[0]` (whichever is not equal to the other), and `possible` is set to True with the most internal loop or if statement being broken out.
