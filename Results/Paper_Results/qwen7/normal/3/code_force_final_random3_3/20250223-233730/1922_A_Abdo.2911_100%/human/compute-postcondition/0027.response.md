Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - If `a[0] == b[0]`, then `possible` remains unchanged and `c[0]` is neither equal to `a[0]` nor `b[0]`.
   - If `a[0] != b[0]`, then `c[0]` is set to the value of either `a[0]` or `b[0]` (whichever is not equal to the other), and `possible` is set to `True` with the most internal loop or if statement being broken out.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` is still a positive integer.

Since no information is provided about the values of `a[0]`, `b[0]`, `c[0]`, or `possible` changing based on the loop head alone, we cannot adjust these values without additional context.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**.
