Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`**.

Explanation: The code sets `possible` to `True`. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `possible` is explicitly set to `True`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and the rule for determining `possible` based on the conditions involving `c[i]`, `a[i]`, and `b[i]` are still valid.
