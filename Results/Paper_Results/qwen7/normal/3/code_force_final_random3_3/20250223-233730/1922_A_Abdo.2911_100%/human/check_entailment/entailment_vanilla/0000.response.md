### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - For each character position `i` in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, the program checks if the characters at that position in `a` and `b` are the same.
   - If they are the same, it checks if the character in `c` is different from this common character. If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the characters in `a` and `b` at position `i` are different, it checks if the character in `c` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If not, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
3. **Output Determination**:
   - After processing all positions, if `possible` is still `False`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different and `c[i]` is neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]`.
   - It also correctly identifies when `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and `c[i]` is different, which would mean `c` does not match the template.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

**Correctness: **True**
