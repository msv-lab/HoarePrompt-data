Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `possible`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the break statement indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional.
