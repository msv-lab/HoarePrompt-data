Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `possible` remains `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`.**

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 1`, assuming `n` is greater than 0. The variable `possible` will remain `True` if at any point during the loop's execution, `c[i]` was found to be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, causing the loop to break. If no such condition was met throughout all iterations, `possible` will remain `False`.
