Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and if `a[0]` is equal to `b[0]`, then `c[0]` is either equal to `a[0]` or no change occurs, `possible` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is not broken out. If `a[0]` is not equal to `b[0]`, then `c[0]` is set to the value of `a[0]` or `b[0]` (whichever is not equal), `possible` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.
