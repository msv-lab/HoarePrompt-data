Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is the loop variable that starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the range function.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the given states**:
   - `mex` is an empty list, which is not relevant to the loop execution.
   - `minn` is 0, which is not directly related to the loop execution.
   - `maxx` is 0, which is not directly related to the loop execution.

Given the above points, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` should be set to 0 (the starting value of the loop), and `n` should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
