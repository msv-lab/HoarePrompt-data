Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, the first element of `arr` is less than or equal to 0, `minn` is the minimum value of `arr[0]`, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `arr[0]` and `minn`. The absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`**.
