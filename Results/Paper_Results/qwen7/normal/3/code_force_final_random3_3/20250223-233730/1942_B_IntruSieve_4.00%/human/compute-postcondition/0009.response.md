Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0; `mex` now contains the minimum value of `arr[i]`; `minn` is 1.**

Explanation: The code increments `minn` by 1. Initially, `minn` was not specified, but since no other value is given, we assume it started at 0. After executing `minn += 1`, `minn` becomes 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
