Output State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is the final value it reaches after following the links in the list `p` until a previously visited node is encountered, `ps` is an integer from input, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is an empty list, and `vis[pb - 1]` is updated to 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes the `vis` list to a length of `n` with all elements set to 0. It then updates the element at index `pb - 1` to 1, indicating that the node at index `pb - 1` has been visited. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
