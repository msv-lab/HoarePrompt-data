Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 2`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1] * (k - (i_end + 1))`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1]`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no further operations are performed after the `break`, the values of the variables `i`, `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` remain unchanged from their initial states. We also note that the execution breaks out of the current loop or conditional block.
