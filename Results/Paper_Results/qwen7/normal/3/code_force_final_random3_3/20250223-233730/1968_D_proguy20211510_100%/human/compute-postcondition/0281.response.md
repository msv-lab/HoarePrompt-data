Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `preb` is increased by `pathb[i]`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is the final value of `p[ps - 1]` after the loop, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is the list of `k` elements, each being `a[ps - 1]`, `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1), `resb` is equal to `max(resb, curr)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since there is no further code to execute after the `break`, none of the variables are modified by the subsequent lines of code. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged except for the fact that we know the execution breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
