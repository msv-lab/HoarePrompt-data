Output State: **`i` is 0; `preb` is `preb + pathb[0]`; if `k` is less than `i + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)'; `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`.**

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. Since `curr` is defined as `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, which simplifies to `preb + pathb[0]`, `resb` will now hold the maximum value between its original value and `preb + pathb[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
