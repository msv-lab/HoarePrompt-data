Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is an integer from input, `ps` is an integer from input, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is an unchanged permutation of length `n`, `a` is an unchanged array of positive integers, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates `n`, `k`, and `pb` by converting them from strings to integers using the `int()` function. However, since the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `pb` were taken as inputs, their specific values are now known integers. The other variables remain unchanged.
