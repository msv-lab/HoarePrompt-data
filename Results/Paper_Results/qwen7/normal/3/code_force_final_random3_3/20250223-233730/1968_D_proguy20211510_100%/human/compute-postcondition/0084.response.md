Output State: **`pres` is equal to `paths[4] * (k - 3)`, `curr` is the result of `pres + paths[4] * (k - 4)`, and `paths` length is greater than 4.**

Explanation: The code `pres += paths[i]` increments `pres` by the value of `paths[i]`, where `i` is 4. So, `pres` becomes `paths[4] * (k - 4)` plus the previous value of `pres`. However, since the initial state only specifies that `pres` was initially `paths[i] * (k - i)` with `i` being 4, `pres` now becomes `paths[4] * (k - 3)`. The value of `curr` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it directly.
