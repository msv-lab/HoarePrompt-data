Postcondition: **`pathb` contains the value of `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers converted from their respective input values, `vis` is a list of n zeros where the element at index `pb - 1` is now 1, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` remain in their previous states, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. The current value of `vis[pb - 1]` is 1.**
