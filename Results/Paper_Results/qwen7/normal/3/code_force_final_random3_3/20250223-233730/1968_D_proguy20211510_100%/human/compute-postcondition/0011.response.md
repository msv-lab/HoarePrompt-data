For the given `while True` loop, the loop will always execute because it is an infinite loop. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0 except for the element at index `pb - 1` which is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is an integer from input, `ps` is an integer from input, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.**
