Output State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + a[pb - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1).**

Explanation: The code initializes `vis` as a list of length `n` filled with zeros, except for the index `pb - 1` which is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
