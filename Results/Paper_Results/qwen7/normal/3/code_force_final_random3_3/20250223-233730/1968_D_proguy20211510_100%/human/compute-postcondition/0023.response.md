The only variable in the loop head is the condition for the `while True` loop, which is always true. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0 except for the element at index `pb - 1` which is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer from input, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` and `a[pb - 1]`, and `paths` is an unchanged empty list.
