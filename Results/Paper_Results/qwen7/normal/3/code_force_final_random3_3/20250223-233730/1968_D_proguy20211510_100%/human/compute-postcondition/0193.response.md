Output State: **`curr` is equal to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `k` is an integer, and if `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the variable `curr` has been updated to the value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. The conditions regarding `k` remain the same, and no other variables have been affected.
