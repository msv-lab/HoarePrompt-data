Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `curr` is undefined, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now `[a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1]]`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1)**.

Explanation: The code `ps = p[ps - 1]` updates the value of `ps` to the value of `p[ps - 1]`. Since no specific values are given for `p` or `ps`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ps`. However, we know that `ps` has been updated to `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
