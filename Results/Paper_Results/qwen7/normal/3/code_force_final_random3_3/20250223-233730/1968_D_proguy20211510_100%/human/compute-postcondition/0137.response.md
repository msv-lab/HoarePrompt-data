Output State: `pathb` will contain a sequence of values from the list `a`, starting from `a[pb - 1]` and following the links defined in the list `p`, until a previously visited node is encountered, causing the loop to break. `paths` remains an empty list. The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain as integers converted from their respective input values. The list `vis` will have a single '1' at the index `pb - 1`, indicating that the node has been visited. The variables `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` remain in their previous states. The list `a` remains unchanged, containing integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers. The loop will continue appending values to `pathb` and updating `pb` until a cycle is detected (i.e., `vis[pb - 1]` becomes 1), at which point the loop breaks.

In summary, `pathb` will represent the path traced through the list `a` following the links until a cycle is found, with `vis` marking the visited node, and all other variables retaining their initial or unchanged states.
