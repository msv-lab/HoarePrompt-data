The only variable in the loop head is the boolean condition `True`, which always evaluates to `True`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time since the loop will always run.

State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for the index `pb - 1` which is set to 1, `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the third input string converted to integer, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.**
