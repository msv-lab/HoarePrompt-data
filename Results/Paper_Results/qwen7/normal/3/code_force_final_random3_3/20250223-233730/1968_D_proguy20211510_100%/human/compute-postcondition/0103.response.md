Based on the initial state provided:

- `pres` will be the sum of `paths[4] * (k - 3)`, `paths[5]`, and `paths[6]`.
- `curr` will be `pres + paths[6] * (k - 6)`.
- `ress` will be the maximum of its previous value and `curr`.
- `i` will be equal to the length of `paths`.
- `resb` is greater than `ress`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Bodya'`. Since no other variables or their values are involved in this particular statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Bodya**
