Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over `range(len(paths))`, meaning `i` ranges from `0` to `len(paths) - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`
   - `curr` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1] * (k - (i_end + 1))`
   - `pres` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1]`
   - `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 2`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `i_end + 2`.
   - `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the loop increment.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` changes from `i_end + 1` to `i_end + 2`.

So, the updated state is:

**State: **`i` is `i_end + 2`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1] * (k - (i_end + 1))`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1]`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`**
