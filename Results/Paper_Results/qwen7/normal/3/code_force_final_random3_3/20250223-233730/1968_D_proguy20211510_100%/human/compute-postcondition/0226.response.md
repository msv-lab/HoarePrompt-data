Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the third input string converted to integer, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet converts the strings `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` to integers. The values of `i`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are updated according to their initial definitions, but their relationships and values remain the same as described in the initial state.
