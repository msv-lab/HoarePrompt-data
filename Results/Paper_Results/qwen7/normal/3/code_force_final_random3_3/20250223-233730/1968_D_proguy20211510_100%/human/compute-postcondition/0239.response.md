Output State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for the index `pb - 1` which is set to 1, `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + a[pb - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]` appended with `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis[pb - 1]` remains 0.**

In this output state:
- `pathb` now includes the value `a[pb - 1]` twice because `pathb.append(a[pb - 1])` was executed.
- All other variables retain their previous values or conditions as described in the initial state.
