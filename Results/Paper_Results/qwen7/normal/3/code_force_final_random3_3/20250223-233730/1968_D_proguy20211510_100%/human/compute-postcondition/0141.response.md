Output State: **`vis` is now `[1, 1] + [0] * (n - 2)`, `pathb` is unchanged, `paths` is now `[a[ps - 1]]`, the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain as integers converted from their respective input values, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` remain in their previous states, the list `a` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. Since `paths` was initially an empty list, after appending `a[ps - 1]`, `paths` becomes a list containing `[a[ps - 1]]`. All other variables and lists remain unchanged.
