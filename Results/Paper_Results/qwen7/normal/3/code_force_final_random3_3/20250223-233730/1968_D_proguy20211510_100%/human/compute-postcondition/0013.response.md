Output State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0 except for the element at index `pb - 1` which is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer from input, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `pb = p[pb - 1]` updates the value of `pb` to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
