Output State: **`pres` is equal to `paths[4] * (k - 3) + paths[i]`, `curr` is the result of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `pres += paths[i]` updates the value of `pres` by adding `paths[i]` to its current value. The other variables (`curr`, `ress`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
