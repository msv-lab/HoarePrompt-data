Output State: **`pathb` contains the value of `a[pb - 1]` appended to it, `paths` is an empty list, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers converted from their respective input values, `vis` is a list of n zeros where the element at index `pb - 1` is now 1, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` remain in their previous states, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is 1.**

This means that the `break` statement has been executed, which does not change any variable values but indicates the exit from the innermost loop or conditional block. All the other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
