Output State: **`curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `i` is 2, `preb` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1) + pathb[2]`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The variable `preb` is updated by adding `pathb[i]`, which is `pathb[2]`, to its current value. The value of `curr` remains unchanged as it was defined before the increment of `i`.
