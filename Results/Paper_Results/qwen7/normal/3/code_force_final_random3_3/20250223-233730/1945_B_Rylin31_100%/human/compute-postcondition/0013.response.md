Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, where for each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) (each between 1 and \(10^{18}\)). For each set of inputs, it calculates and prints the value of \(m // a + m // b + 2\). After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.**
