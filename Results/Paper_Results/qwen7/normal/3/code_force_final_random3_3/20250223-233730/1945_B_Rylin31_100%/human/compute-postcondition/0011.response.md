Output State: The value of `t` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` will be equal to the final value of `t-1` after the loop completes, `a`, `b`, and `m` will each be the last set of integers entered by the user for their respective iteration of the loop. The loop will have processed `t` iterations, with each iteration reading three integers (`a`, `b`, `m`) from the user input and printing the result of `m // a + m // b + 2`.
