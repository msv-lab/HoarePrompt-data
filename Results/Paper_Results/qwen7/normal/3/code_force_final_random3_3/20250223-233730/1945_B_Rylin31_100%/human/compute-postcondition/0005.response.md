Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, and `m` is the third integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
