You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` will be equal to the final value of `t-1` after the loop completes, `a`, `b`, and `m` will each be the last set of integers entered by the user for their respective iteration of the loop. The loop will have processed `t` iterations, with each iteration reading three integers (`a`, `b`, `m`) from the user input and printing the result of `m // a + m // b + 2`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. According to the problem description, the formula used in the program (`m // a + m // b + 2`) is incorrect. This formula assumes that every launch from both installations will overlap, which is not necessarily true.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

- Input: `6 7 4`
- Expected Output: `2` (as explained in the example)

However, let's analyze the program's output for this case:

- `m // a` calculates how many times the first installation launches within the visibility period of `m`.
- `m // b` calculates how many times the second installation launches within the visibility period of `m`.
- Adding `2` accounts for the initial launches from both installations.

For `a = 6`, `b = 7`, and `m = 4`:
- `4 // 6` is `0` (no launches from the first installation within the first 4 minutes).
- `4 // 7` is `0` (no launches from the second installation within the first 4 minutes).
- Adding `2` gives `2`.

This seems correct for this specific case, but let's consider another case to show the flaw:

- Input: `3 4 10`
- Expected Output: `7`

Using the program:
- `10 // 3` is `3` (launches at 3, 6, 9).
- `10 // 4` is `2` (launches at 4, 8).
- Adding `2` gives `7`.

This seems correct for this case as well. However, let's manually check the overlaps:

- Launches from the first installation: `0, 3, 6, 9`
- Launches from the second installation: `0, 4, 8`

At `t = 0`: Both installations launch, so `2` fireworks.
At `t = 3`: First installation launches, so `1` additional firework.
At `t = 4`: Second installation launches, so `1` additional firework.
At `t = 6`: First installation launches, so `1` additional firework.
At `t = 8`: Second installation launches, so `1` additional firework.
At `t = 9`: First installation launches, so `1` additional firework.

So, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `3`, not `7`.

Therefore, the program does not handle the overlaps correctly and fails for certain cases. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
