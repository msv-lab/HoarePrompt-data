Output State: The value of `t` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` will be equal to 9999 (since the loop runs from 0 to t-1), `a`, `b`, and `m` will each be the last set of integers entered by the user for the respective iteration of the loop. The loop will have executed `t` times, with each iteration processing its own set of `a`, `b`, and `m` values provided by the user input.
