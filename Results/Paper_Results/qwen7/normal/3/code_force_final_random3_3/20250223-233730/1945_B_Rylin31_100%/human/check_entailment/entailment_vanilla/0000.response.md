Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes, and from the second installation every `b` minutes. Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

### Given Program
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

### Reasoning
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
2. **Variables**: It correctly extracts `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.
3. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `m // a` gives the number of fireworks from the first installation that are visible within the interval `[0, m]`.
   - Similarly, `m // b` gives the number of fireworks from the second installation that are visible within the interval `[0, m]`.
   - However, the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the overlaps correctly.

### Correct Calculation
To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. The LCM of `a` and `b` will give us the period after which the patterns of launches repeat. 

The correct approach involves:
- Calculating the number of fireworks from each installation that overlap within the interval `[0, m]`.
- Using the inclusion-exclusion principle to avoid double-counting overlaps.

However, the provided solution attempts to solve it using a simpler but incorrect approach. Let's verify the provided solution with the example cases:

#### Example Verification
1. **Example 1**: `a = 6`, `b = 7`, `m = 4`
   - `m // a = 0` (no fireworks from the first installation within 4 minutes)
   - `m // b = 0` (no fireworks from the second installation within 4 minutes)
   - The result should be `2` (since they do not overlap, the maximum is 2).
   - Provided solution: `print(4 // 6 + 4 // 7 + 2) = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2` (correct).

2. **Example 2**: `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `m = 10`
   - `m // a = 3` (fireworks at 0, 3, 6, 9)
   - `m // b = 2` (fireworks at 0, 4, 8)
   - Overlaps: `0` (both at 0), `1` (only 3 from first, 4 from second), `1` (only 6 from first, 8 from second)
   - The result should be `3 + 2 - 1 = 4` (but the provided solution gives 7).
   - Provided solution: `print(10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2) = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7` (incorrect).

Given these examples, the provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

### Conclusion
The provided solution is incorrect due to the flawed calculation method. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
