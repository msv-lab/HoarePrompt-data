Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Bob's profit based on the given problem description. The binary search approach used in the `while` loop is not appropriate for this problem. Instead, the solution should directly calculate the profit for each possible value of \( k \) from 0 to \( \min(n, b) \) and choose the maximum profit.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            current_profit = 0
            current_profit += sum((b - i + 1) for i in range(1, k + 1))
            current_profit += (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, current_profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This corrected program iterates over all possible values of \( k \) and calculates the profit for each, then prints the maximum profit found.
