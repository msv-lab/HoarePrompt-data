Output State: **`xx` is a list containing the string `x`; `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`; `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`; `i` is `n`; `j` is `n + 1`; `x` remains as the input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `xx.append(x)` appends the string `x` to the list `xx`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `j`, `a`, `b`, or `x`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states. The list `xx` now includes the string `x` as its last element.
