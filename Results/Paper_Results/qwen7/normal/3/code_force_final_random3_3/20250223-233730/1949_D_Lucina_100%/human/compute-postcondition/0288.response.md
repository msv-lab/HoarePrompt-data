Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is between 2 and 24, `nx` is 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'**.

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string (`''`), after appending 'S', `nx` becomes 'S'. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, `i` remains `n + 1`, `n` remains between 2 and 24, and `xx[i][j - 1]` remains '?'.
