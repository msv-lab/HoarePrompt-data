Output State: **`j` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), `a[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the given initial state, and there is no information about the list `a`. Therefore, the only change is that `a[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
