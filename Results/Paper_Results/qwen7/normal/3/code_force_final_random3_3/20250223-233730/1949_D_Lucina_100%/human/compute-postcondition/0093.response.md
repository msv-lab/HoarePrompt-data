Output State: **`xx` is a list containing the string `x`, `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `3`, `b[j]` is `1`**.

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is `3`, the value of `b[3]` is incremented by 1. Since `b[i]` was initially `1` and `i` is `n + 1`, the value of `b[i]` remains unchanged. All other variables and their states remain the same as the initial state.
