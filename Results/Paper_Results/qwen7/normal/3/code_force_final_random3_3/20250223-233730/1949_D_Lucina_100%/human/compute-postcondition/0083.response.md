Output State: **`xx` is a list containing the string `x`, `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `1`, and `b[i]` is `b[i] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is `n + 1`, the value of `b[n + 1]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
