Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `nx` is a string that has been built up over the course of the loop.
   - `i` is set to `n + 1`.
   - `j` is incremented to `n + 1` as well.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `i` from 1 to `n`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was at its maximum value, which is `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to 1.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `nx` is built up within the loop and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.
   - `j` is incremented to `n + 1` and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

5. **Final State Before Next Iteration**:
   - `i` should be set to 1 for the loop to execute again.
   - `nx` remains unchanged.
   - `j` remains at `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`nx` is a string that has been built up over the course of the loop, `i` is 1, `j` is `n + 1`**.
