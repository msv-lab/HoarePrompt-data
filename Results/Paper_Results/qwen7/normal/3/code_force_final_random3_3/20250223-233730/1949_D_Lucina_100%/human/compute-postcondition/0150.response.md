Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be between 2 and 24; `sa` is a list containing 3.**

The code appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `sa`. Since `i` was already 3, appending it to the list `sa` adds 3 to the list. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition for `n` also remains the same.
