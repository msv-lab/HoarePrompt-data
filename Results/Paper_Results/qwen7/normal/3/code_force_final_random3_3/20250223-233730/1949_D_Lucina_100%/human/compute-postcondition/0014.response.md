Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), and the element at index `j-1` of `x` is 'S', `b[i]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `i` or the current value of `b[i]`. Therefore, we only know that `b[i]` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain in their initial states.
