Output State: **`nx` is increased by `xx[i][j - 1]`, `j` is 2 or 3, `n` must be at least 2**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Since `j` is either 2 or 3, `j - 1` will be either 1 or 2, respectively. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, the updated state includes the change to `nx`, along with the unchanged states of `j` and `n`.
