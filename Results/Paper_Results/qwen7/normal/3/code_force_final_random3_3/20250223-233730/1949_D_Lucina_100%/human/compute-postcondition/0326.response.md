Postcondition: `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', and `xx[i][j - 1]` remains as '?'.

This postcondition summarizes that after the if-else block executes, `i` and `j` remain 1, `n` is at least 2, and `nx` can be either 'S' or 'F'. Additionally, `xx[i][j - 1]` remains unchanged as '?'.
