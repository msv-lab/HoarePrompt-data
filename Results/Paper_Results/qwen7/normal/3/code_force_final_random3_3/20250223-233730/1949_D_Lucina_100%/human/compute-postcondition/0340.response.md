Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is 'SFF', and `xx[1][1]` remains unchanged and stays as '?'**.

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by concatenating 'F' to its current value 'SF', resulting in 'SFF'. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `n`, and `xx[1][1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
