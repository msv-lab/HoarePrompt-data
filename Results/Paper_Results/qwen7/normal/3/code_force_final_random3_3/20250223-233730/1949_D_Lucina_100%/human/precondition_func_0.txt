n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, where the j-th character of the i-th line corresponds to the transition video between the i-th and the j-th scenarios. Each line contains n characters, which can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no transition video yet). At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided, represented by F or S, and the rest are undecided, represented by ?. The input guarantees that the i-th character of the j-th line and the j-th character of the i-th line are the same for all i and j.
