Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a 2D list where each element represents the transition video between two scenarios. The list has n rows and n columns, with n being an integer between 2 and 24. Each cell can contain 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?', or '.' (no transition video yet). The function returns information based on the given constraints, such as the nature of the transition videos between scenarios.**

This functionality describes a function that takes no explicit parameters but operates on a predefined 2D list structure with specific constraints about its content and size.
