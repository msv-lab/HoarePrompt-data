Output State: **`j` is 1 or 2; `n` must be at least 2; `xx[i][j - 1]` is either `nxS` or `'?'`; `nx` is `nxS`.**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by appending 'S' to its current value. Since the initial value of `nx` is not specified, we represent it as `nxS`. The other variables (`j`, `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
