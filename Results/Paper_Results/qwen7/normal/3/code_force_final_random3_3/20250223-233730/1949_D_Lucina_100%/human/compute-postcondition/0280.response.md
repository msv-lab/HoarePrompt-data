Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is given as `n + 1`.
   - `n` is between 2 and 24.
   - `nx` is an empty string (though this variable is not part of the loop head).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for j in range(1, n + 1):` will execute if `n + 1 > 1`, which is always true since `n` is between 2 and 24.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop will execute regardless of the value of `i` (as long as `n` is within the specified range), we don't need to adjust `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is within the specified range (between 2 and 24) for the loop to execute properly.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `nx` (though `nx` is not part of the loop head, it is mentioned in the initial state).

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be between 2 and 24, `nx` is an empty string**
