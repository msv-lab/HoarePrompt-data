Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and 24, `xx[i][j]` is either not '?' or equals '?', `nx` is a string with the value 'S' appended to it, `j` is `j + 1`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the string 'S' to `nx`. Since `nx` was previously a string (based on the conditions given), appending 'S' to it maintains its string nature. Additionally, the code does not affect the values of `n`, `xx[i][j]`, or `i`, but it increments `j` by 1. Therefore, the updated state includes the appended 'S' to `nx` and the incremented `j`.
