Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a complete set of transition videos such that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type appear, regardless of the order of scenarios. Given some predefined videos, the program needs to fill in the remaining ones while respecting the constraints.

2. **Key Points in the Program**:
   - The program reads an input matrix representing the current state of transition videos.
   - It counts the number of 'F' (funny) and 'S' (scary) videos for each scenario.
   - It decides whether to prioritize 'F' or 'S' based on the counts.
   - It fills in the remaining '?' values with 'F' or 'S' accordingly.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The program correctly initializes variables and processes the input matrix.
   - It counts the number of 'F' and 'S' videos for each scenario.
   - The logic to decide whether to prioritize 'F' or 'S' is based on the counts, which is a reasonable approach.
   - The program fills in the remaining '?' values by ensuring that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is met. This is done by checking if the current scenario or the target scenario is among the top \(\frac{n}{4} - 1\) scenarios with the preferred type.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the number of 'F' videos is greater than or equal to the number of 'S' videos differently from the case where 'S' videos are more frequent.
   - It ensures that the final output respects the initial constraints and prints the new list of transition videos.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program logic appears to be sound and should work for the given constraints. It correctly handles the counting and decision-making process to ensure the constraint is met.

Correctness: **True**
