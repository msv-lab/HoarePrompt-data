Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `nx` is 'FS', and `n` is a positive integer.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Given that `nx` initially is 'F' followed by the character at index `xx[2][1]`, and since `xx[2][1]` is not specified, we assume it to be 'S' (as per the initial state description), making `nx` initially 'FS'. After executing `nx += 'S'`, `nx` becomes 'FS' + 'S' = 'FSS'. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged.
