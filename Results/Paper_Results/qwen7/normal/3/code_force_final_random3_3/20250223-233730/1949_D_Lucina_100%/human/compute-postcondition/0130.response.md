Output State: **`i` is 4; `sa` is [2, 3, 4]; `sb` is [3]; `n` must be between 2 and 24**

The code `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 4, to the list `sa`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `sa` now contains the elements [2, 3, 4], while `i`, `sb`, and `n` retain their original values and conditions.
