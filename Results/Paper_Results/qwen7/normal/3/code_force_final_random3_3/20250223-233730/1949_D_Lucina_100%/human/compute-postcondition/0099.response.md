Output State: **`xx` is a list containing the string `x`, `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is `4`, `a[j]` is `1`**.

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is `4`, `a[4]` is incremented by 1. Since `a[i]` was initially `1` and `i` is `n + 2`, `a[n + 2]` was `1`. However, the new value of `a[4]` is now `1 + 1 = 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
