Output State: **`nx` is equal to the previous value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', it implies that `xx[i][j - 1]` holds a numerical value. The precondition that `n` must be between 2 and 24 remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet.
