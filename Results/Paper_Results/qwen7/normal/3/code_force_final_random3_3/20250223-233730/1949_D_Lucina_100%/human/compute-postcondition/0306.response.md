Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be between `2` and `24`, `nx` is either 'FS' followed by 'S' or 'SS' followed by 'S', and `xx[i][n]` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` can be either 'FS' or 'SS' followed by 'S'. Therefore, after executing the code, `nx` becomes 'FS' followed by 'S' or 'SS' followed by 'S'. All other variables remain unchanged.
