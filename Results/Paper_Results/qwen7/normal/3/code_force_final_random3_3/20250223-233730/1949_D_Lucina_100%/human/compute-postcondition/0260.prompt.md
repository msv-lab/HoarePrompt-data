Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be between 2 and 24, `sa` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` will contain all indices `i` (from 2 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `n + 1`, as the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n + 1`. During each iteration, if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, the index `i` is appended to the list `sa`. The list `sb` remains unchanged, containing all indices `i` (from 2 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all the iterations, `nx` will be a string that has been built up over the course of the loop based on the conditions provided. `i` will be set to `n + 1` (as per the initial state), and `j` will have been incremented to `n + 1` as well since the loop runs from 1 to `n` inclusive. The value of `nx` will be determined by the values of `xx[i][j - 1]` for each iteration, with specific rules for appending 'F' or 'S' when certain conditions are met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final value of `nx` will be a string that depends on the values in `xx`, `i`, `j`, and `sa`. After all iterations, `i` will still be 1, and `j` will be `n + 1`. The string `nx` will be constructed based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, if `xx[1][j-1]` is not '?', it will append that character to `nx`. If `xx[1][j-1]` is '?', it will check if `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`. If so, it appends 'F'; otherwise, it appends 'S'. This process continues until `j` reaches `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final value of `nx` will be a string that starts with either 'F' or 'S' repeated multiple times based on the conditions inside the loop, followed by the characters from `xx[2][0]` to `xx[2][n-1]`, and `i` remains 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
