Output State: **`xx` is a list containing the string `x`, `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `i` is `n + 2`, `j` is `3`**.

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in list `a` by 1. Initially, `i` is `n + 1`. After executing the code, `i` becomes `n + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
