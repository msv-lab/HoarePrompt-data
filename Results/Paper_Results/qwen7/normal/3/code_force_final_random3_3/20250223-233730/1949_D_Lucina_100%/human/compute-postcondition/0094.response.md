Postcondition: `xx` is a list containing the string `x`, `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `3`. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `xx`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
