Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is between 2 and 24, `nx` is a string composed of 'F', 'S', and possibly characters from `xx[i][j - 1]` where `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'.**

In this final state, the loop has executed for all iterations, meaning `j` has gone through every value from 1 to `n`. The string `nx` will contain a sequence of 'F', 'S', and any non '?' characters from `xx[i][j - 1]` encountered during the loop. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` will be updated accordingly; otherwise, it will maintain its previous value. The variable `i` remains `n + 1` as it is incremented within the loop but never used in the loop itself. The variable `n` stays within the range of 2 to 24 as per the initial condition.
