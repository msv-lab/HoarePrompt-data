Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is 1 or 2.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).
- If `x[j-1]` is 'F', then `a[1]` is increased by 1.
- If `x[j-1]` is 'S', then `b[1]` is increased by 1.
- If `x[j-1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then `b[1]` is not changed.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `j`**: The loop starts from `j = 1` and goes up to `j = n`. Since `j` is incremented within the loop, it will be `j = 2` at the start of the next iteration if `j` was `1` in the previous iteration.
2. **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged within the loop. Therefore, `n` stays the same for the next iteration.
3. **Variables `x`, `a`, and `b`**: These variables are modified based on the condition inside the loop. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we do not need to consider the modifications to these variables.

### Adjusting the States
- `j` will be incremented by 1, so if `j` was 1, it will be 2.
- `n` remains the same.

### New State
State: **`j` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\)**

So, the final answer is:
State: **`j` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\)**
