Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the transition video plan according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to decide whether a `?` should be replaced with `F` or `S` is flawed. The program attempts to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type occur for any permutation of scenarios. However, the implementation does not properly handle the constraint that the plan must work for all permutations of the scenarios.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
5
.??F?
.?S?.
F??.?
??S.?
????. 
```

The output generated by the program is:

```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FFS.F
FFFF.
```

However, this output does not satisfy the requirement that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3 \cdot 5}{4} \rceil = 4\) consecutive videos of the same type occur for any permutation of the scenarios. For example, if the scenarios are played in the order 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, the transition videos would be `F`, `S`, `F`, `F`, `S`, which has 3 consecutive `F`s, but this is still within the limit. However, for the permutation 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the transition videos would be `F`, `F`, `S`, `F`, `F`, which has 3 consecutive `F`s, but this is still within the limit. The issue arises when considering more complex permutations and ensuring the constraint is met for all of them.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated algorithm to ensure the constraint is met for all permutations, which the current implementation does not achieve.
