Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 4, `x` is an input string, `a` is a list where the element at index 4 is incremented by 1, and `xx` contains the string `x`.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the element at index `j` (which is 4) in the list `a` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `xx`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
