Output State: **`i` is 4; `sa` is [2, 3, 4]; `sb` is [3, 4]; `n` must be between 2 and 24.**

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `sb`. Initially, `sb` is `[3]`. After appending 4, `sb` becomes `[3, 4]`. The values of `i`, `sa`, and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
