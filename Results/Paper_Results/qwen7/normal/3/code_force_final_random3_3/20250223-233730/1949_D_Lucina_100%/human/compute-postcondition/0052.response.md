Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `j` is 2, `x` is an input string, `a` and `b` are determined based on the characters in the string `x`, and the list `xx` contains the string `x`. If the character at position `j-1` in `x` is 'F', then the element at index `n` in list `a` is incremented by 1. If the character at position `j-1` in `x` is 'S', then the element at index `j` in list `b` is increased by 1.
