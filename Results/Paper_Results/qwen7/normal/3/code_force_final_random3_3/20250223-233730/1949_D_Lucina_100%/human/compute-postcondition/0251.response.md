Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `nx` is 'FS' followed by the character at index `xx[2][0]`, and `n` is a positive integer.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at index `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, `j - 1` equals 2. So, the character at `xx[2][2]` is appended to `nx`. Since `nx` initially was `'FS'` followed by the character at index `xx[2][1]`, appending the character at `xx[2][2]` modifies `nx` to be `'FS'` followed by the character at index `xx[2][0]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged.
