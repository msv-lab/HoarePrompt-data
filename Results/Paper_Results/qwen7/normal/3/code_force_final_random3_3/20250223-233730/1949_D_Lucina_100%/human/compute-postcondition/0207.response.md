Output State: **`nx` is the string formed by concatenating the character at position `i` in `xx` with the character at position `j-1` in `xx`, `i` is 1, `j` is `k + 1`, and if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated accordingly.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` concatenates the character at position `i` in `xx` with the character at position `j-1` in `xx` to the existing value of `nx`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 1 and `j` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. After the previous iteration, `j` was `k`, so for the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`. The condition `if xx[i][j - 1] is not '?'` determines whether `nx` is updated. If the condition is true, `nx` is updated to include the concatenated characters; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
