Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be between 2 and 24, `nx` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `nx = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `nx`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `n + 1` and `n` must still be between 2 and 24.
