Postcondition: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found so far (or -inf if no such difference exists), `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is 3, and `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` are updated accordingly, and `index` is set to 3. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` is updated if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, but `max_diff` and `index` remain unchanged.
