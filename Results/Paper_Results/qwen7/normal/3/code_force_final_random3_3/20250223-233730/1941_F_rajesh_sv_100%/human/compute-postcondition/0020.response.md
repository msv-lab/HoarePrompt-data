Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, so the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `4`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 4, `n` must be greater than 4.

5. **Adjust the states of the other variables**: The postconditions given do not involve `n`, so it remains unchanged. The other variables (`max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, and `diff`) are not directly affected by the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, and `n` must be greater than 4.

**State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found so far (or -inf if no such difference exists), `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 4**.
