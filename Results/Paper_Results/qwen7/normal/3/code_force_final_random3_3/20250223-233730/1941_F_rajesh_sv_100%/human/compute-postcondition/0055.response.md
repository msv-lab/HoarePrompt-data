Postcondition: `h` is the index of the element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, and `l` must be less than `h`. `mid` is recalculated based on the value of `h` and `l`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If the condition `(mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum)` is true, then `h` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` remains `mid`.
