Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is equal to `mid`, and `(mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum)`**.

Explanation: The code `h = mid` updates the value of `h` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, and the condition involving `mid_sum`, `left`, `right`, and `mid_next_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
