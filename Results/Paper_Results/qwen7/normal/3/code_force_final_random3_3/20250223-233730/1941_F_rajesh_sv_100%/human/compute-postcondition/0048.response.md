Output State: **`h` is the index of the element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, and `l` must be less than `h`; `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mid_sum` as the sum of `D[mid]` and `f`, and `mid_next_sum` as the sum of `D[mid + 1]` and `f`. Since `mid` is already calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, these new variables `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are added to the state. The conditions on `h`, `l`, and `mid` remain unchanged.
