Postcondition: `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f) with the next value of `f`, `l` must be less than `bisect_left(D, right - f)`, and `h` is set to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`; `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`. Additionally, `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`.
