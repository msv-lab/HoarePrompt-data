Postcondition: `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f) with the next value of `f`, `l` must be less than `bisect_left(D, right - f)`, and `h` is set to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`; `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`, `h` remains unchanged, `mid` remains unchanged, `mid_sum` remains unchanged, `mid_next_sum` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, `f` remains unchanged, and `D` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`, and all other variables retain their previous conditions.
