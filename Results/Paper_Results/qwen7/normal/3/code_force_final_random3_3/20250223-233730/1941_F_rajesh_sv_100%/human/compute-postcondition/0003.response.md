The only object in the loop head is the variable `testcases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. For the loop to execute again, `testcases` must be greater than 1 because it starts from a value greater than 0 and decreases by 1 each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must be greater than 1.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 1**
