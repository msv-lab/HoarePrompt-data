Output State: **`mid` is `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`**

The code `mid = l + (h - l) // 2` simply reassigns the value of `mid` to be the same as its previous value, which is already defined as `l + (h - l) // 2`. Therefore, the value of `mid` remains unchanged, and all other variables retain their previous values.
