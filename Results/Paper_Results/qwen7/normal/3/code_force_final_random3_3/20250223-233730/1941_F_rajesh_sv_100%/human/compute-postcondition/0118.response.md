Postcondition: `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or `mid`, `h` is either greater than `l` or equal to `mid`, and depending on the condition, either `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` holds true, leading to `l` being updated to `mid + 1`, or the condition `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum` holds true, leading to `h` being updated to `mid`.
