Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, and `F` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The code `l = bisect_right(D, left - f)` uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `left - F[0]` in the sorted list `D`. This insertion point is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`. The value of `F` remains unchanged, and it is mentioned that `F` must contain at least one element.
