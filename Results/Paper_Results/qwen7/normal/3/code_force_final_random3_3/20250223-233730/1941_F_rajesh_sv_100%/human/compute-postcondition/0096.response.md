Output State: **`mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` remains unchanged, `l` and `h` remain unchanged, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, `f` remains unchanged, `D` remains unchanged, and `l < h` must still hold true.**

This means that the value of `mid` has been recalculated using the formula `l + (h - l) // 2`. All other variables retain their previous values.
