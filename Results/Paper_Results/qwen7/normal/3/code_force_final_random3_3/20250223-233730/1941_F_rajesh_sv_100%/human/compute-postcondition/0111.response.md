Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`**.

This means that the variables `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` have been assigned new values based on the dictionary `D` and the constant `f`. The value of `mid` remains unchanged from its initial state, and the condition that `l` must be less than `h` still holds true.
