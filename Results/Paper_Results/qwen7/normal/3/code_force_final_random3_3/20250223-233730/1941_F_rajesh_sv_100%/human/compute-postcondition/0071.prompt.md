Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `h` is the index of the element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`, and `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `h` is the index of the element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, and `l` must be less than `h`; `mid` is recalculated based on the condition `(mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum)`. If the condition is true, `mid` becomes `mid + 1`, and `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, `h` remains `mid`, and `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, with `mid` recalculated as usual.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`, and `l` remains the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]` and must be less than `h`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
