Postcondition: **`l` is equal to `h`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` holds the smallest value between `ans` and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)` throughout the process.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. If `l` equals `h`, then `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` are recalculated, and `ans` retains the smallest value it has been updated to throughout the process. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only considers the case where `l` equals `h`.
