Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or `mid`, `h` is strictly greater than `l`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`**.

This means that the value of `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged, and `l` and `h` retain their original conditions.
