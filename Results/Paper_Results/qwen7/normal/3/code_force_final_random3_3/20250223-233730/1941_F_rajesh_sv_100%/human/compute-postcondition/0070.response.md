Output State: `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, and `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`. The value of `mid` will be the last calculated midpoint during the loop's execution, which satisfies the condition `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `l` and `h` will define the range within array `D` where the elements satisfy the given conditions, and `mid` will point to the last valid midpoint that meets the specified criteria.
