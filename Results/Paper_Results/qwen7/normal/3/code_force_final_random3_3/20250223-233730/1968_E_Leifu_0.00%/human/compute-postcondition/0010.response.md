Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j`, `4`, and `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `j` is in the range from `4` to `n + 1`.
   - This means `j` should start from `4` and go up to `n + 1` (inclusive).

3. **Initial values of the variables**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is not equal to 3.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is not part of the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `t` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is such that the loop can start and continue executing. Specifically, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 because `j` starts from 4.
   - `n` cannot be 3, as stated in the initial condition.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 and not equal to 3.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 and not equal to 3, `i` is 0**
