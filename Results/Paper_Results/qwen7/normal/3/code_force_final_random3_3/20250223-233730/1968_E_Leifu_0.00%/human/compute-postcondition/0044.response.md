Based on the initial state provided, `n` must be greater than 3. However, there are no other variables or objects defined in the initial state that would affect the execution of the print statement. The print statement itself does not define any new variables; it simply references the variable `j`.

Given the information, `j` is not defined in the initial state, and since no value is assigned to `j` within the provided code snippet, `j` could be any value. However, since the print statement is trying to print `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)`, and `j` is not defined, we cannot determine a specific value for `j`.

Therefore, the output will be a string representation of `j` followed by a space and then the same string representation of `j`. Since `j` is undefined, we cannot provide a precise value for `j`.

Output: **str(j) str(j)**
