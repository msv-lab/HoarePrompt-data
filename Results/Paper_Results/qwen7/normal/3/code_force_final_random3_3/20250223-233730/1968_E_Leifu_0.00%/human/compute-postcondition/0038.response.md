Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain in their initial state, which in this case is not specified beyond the fact that they are not mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only updated information is that `n` is now an input integer.
