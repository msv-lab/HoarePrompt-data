Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, and `j` is `n`.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 and not equal to 3, `i` is 1, and `j` is `n` is still valid, but now `n` is updated to the value of the input provided by the user.
