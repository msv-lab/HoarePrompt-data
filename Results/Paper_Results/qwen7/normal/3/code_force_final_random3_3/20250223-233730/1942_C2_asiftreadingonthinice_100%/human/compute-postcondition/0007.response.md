Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - From the given state, `i` is initially 0.
   - `len(a)` is the length of the list `a`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will start executing when `i` is in the range `[1, len(a))`.
   - Since `i` is initially 0, the loop will not execute until `i` becomes 1 or more.
   - Therefore, `i` must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is at least 1 for the loop to start executing.
   - The length of the list `a` (`len(a)`) should be at least 1 for the loop to have valid iterations.

5. **Consider Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `ans`, `tmp`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` must be at least 1.
- `len(a)` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `len(a)` must be at least 1**
