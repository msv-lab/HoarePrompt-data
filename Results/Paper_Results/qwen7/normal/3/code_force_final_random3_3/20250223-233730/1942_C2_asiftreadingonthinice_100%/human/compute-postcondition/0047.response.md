Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`; `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it during the loop plus `i`; `tmp` is a non-empty list containing all the values added to it whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2; `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**

In this step, the value of `ans` is incremented by the current value of `i`. The other variables (`i`, `tmp`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
