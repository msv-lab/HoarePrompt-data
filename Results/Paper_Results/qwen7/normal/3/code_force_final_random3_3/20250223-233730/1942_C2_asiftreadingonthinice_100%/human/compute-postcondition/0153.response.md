Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(a)`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `len(a)` must be at least 1
   - If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ans` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, and `tmp` contains an element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(a)` must still be at least 1 (since it doesn't change within the loop).

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - We need to check if `a[2] - a[1]` is equal to 2 or if it is even and `tmp` contains the correct value.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 2
- `len(a)` must be at least 1
- The condition for `ans` and `tmp` remains the same as they depend on the values of `a` which do not change until the loop modifies them.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `len(a)` must be at least 1, and if `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is equal to 2, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, and `tmp` contains an element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`**.
