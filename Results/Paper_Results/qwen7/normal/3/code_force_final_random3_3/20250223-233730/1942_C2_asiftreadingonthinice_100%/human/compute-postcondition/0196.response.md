Output State: **`tmp` now has one fewer element, `i` is either the first element of the original `tmp` or has been removed, `ans` is the sum of its previous value and `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += i` adds the value of `i` to `ans`. Since `i` is either the first element of `tmp` or has been removed and `tmp` now has one fewer element, the value of `i` is added to `ans`. The precondition that `tmp` must not be empty is still valid, and `tmp` now has one fewer element.
