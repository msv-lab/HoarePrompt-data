Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. Additionally, the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y, and the second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
