Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is the total number of times `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2 or is even plus 1, `tmp` contains elements which are half the difference between consecutive elements of `a` when that difference is even, and the value of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is equal to 2.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables (`i`, `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `ans` now includes one additional count compared to its initial state.
