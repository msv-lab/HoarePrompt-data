Output State: **`ans` is increased by `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1` and `y -= i - 1` is performed, otherwise we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, `tmp` is the list without the current element `i`, `y` is `y - (i - 1)` if the condition was met.**

This means that `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. If the condition `y >= i - 1` was true before this line of code, `ans` would have been increased by `i`. The value of `i` changes to the next element in `tmp`, and `tmp` is updated to exclude the current element `i`. If the condition was false, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
