Postcondition: **`i` will be equal to `len(a)`, `ans` will be the total number of times `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2 or is even, `tmp` will contain elements which are half the difference between consecutive elements of `a` when that difference is even, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2**
