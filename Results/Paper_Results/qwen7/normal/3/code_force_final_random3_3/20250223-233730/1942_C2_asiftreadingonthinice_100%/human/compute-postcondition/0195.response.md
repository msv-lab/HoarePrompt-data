Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in tmp`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `tmp`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**:
   - If `i` is removed from `tmp`, `ans` is updated by adding the first element from `tmp` before removal, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.
   - If `i` remains as the first element from `tmp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `tmp` must not be empty.
   - `i` is either removed from `tmp` and `ans` is updated by adding the first element from `tmp` before removal and decreasing `y` by `i - 1`, or `i` remains as the first element from `tmp` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `tmp` must still contain elements.
   - If `i` was removed from `tmp`, then `tmp` would have one fewer element. If `i` remained as the first element, `tmp` would remain unchanged.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- Since `tmp` must not be empty and the loop continues based on the condition that `tmp` contains elements, `tmp` must still contain at least one element.
- If `i` was removed from `tmp`, `tmp` would now have one fewer element. If `i` remained as the first element, `tmp` would remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `tmp` still contains elements, and `i` is either the first element of `tmp` (if it remains) or has been removed and `tmp` now has one fewer element.

**State: **`tmp` must not be empty, `i` is either the first element of `tmp` or has been removed and `tmp` now has one fewer element**.
