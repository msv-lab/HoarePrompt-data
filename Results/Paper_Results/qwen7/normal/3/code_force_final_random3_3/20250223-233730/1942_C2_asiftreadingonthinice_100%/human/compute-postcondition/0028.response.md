Output State: **`i` is 3; `len(a)` is at least 1; `tmp` contains an element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends to `tmp` a tuple containing half the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i-1]`. Given that `i` is 3, the calculation becomes `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. The length of `a` remains unchanged, and `i` is also unchanged.
