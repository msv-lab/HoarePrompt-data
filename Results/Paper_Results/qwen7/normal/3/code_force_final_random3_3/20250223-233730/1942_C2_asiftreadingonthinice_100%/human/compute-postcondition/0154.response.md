Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is 2, `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, and `tmp` contains an element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is 2.
- The condition `a[i] - a[i - 1]` being equal to 2 sets `ans` to 1. However, since the code only increments `ans` by 1 without checking this condition, `ans` is incremented from its initial value of 0 (implied) to 1.
- Since `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, the value of `ans` is updated to 2.
- The value of `tmp` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet. It still contains the element `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`.
