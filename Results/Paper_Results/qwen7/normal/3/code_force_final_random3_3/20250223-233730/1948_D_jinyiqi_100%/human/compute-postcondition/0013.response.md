Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is 0.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `j` must be at least 1.
- `count` equals `j`.

The condition states that the character at index `k` in string `s` is either a question mark or the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is a question mark or the character at index `k` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the print statement:

- `count` is explicitly defined as `j`.
- Therefore, `count * 2` will be `j * 2`.

Since `j` is at least 1, the minimum value for `count * 2` would be 2 (if `j` is 1).

Thus, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **2*j (where j is at least 1)**
