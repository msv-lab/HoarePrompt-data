Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j`, which is initialized in the `range` function.
   - The `range` function parameters are `n // 2, 0, -1`, which means `j` starts at `n // 2` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`:**
   - Since `j` starts at `n // 2`, we need to ensure that `n // 2` is a valid starting point for the loop.
   - For the loop to execute, `n // 2` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since `j` decrements to 0).

3. **Determine the State of `n`:**
   - `n` is defined as the length of the list `s`.
   - To ensure the loop can start, `n` must be at least 2 because `n // 2` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 so that `n // 2` is at least 1.
   - The initial value of `j` is `n // 2`, so we need to ensure that `n // 2` is at least 1.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `j`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is `n // 2` which must be at least 1**
