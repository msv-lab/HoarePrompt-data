Postcondition: `k` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `j` must be at least 1, and `count` remains either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` is true or false, as the if statement evaluates to `count == j` which does not change the value of `count`.
