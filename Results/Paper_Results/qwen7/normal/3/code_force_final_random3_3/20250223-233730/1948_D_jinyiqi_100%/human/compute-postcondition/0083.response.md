Postcondition: `n` is `N`, `j` is `J - 1`, `N - (J - 1)` is greater than 0, and `count` equals `J` if the character at index `k` in string `s` is either a question mark (`?`), the character at index `k + J - 1` in string `s` is a question mark (`?`), or the character at index `k` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `k + J - 1` in string `s`. If none of these conditions are met, `count` remains unchanged.
