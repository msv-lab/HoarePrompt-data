Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark with a lowercase Latin letter.
2. The provided program has a few issues:
   - The function `func_1` is called without any parameters, but it reads input directly, which is not consistent with the expected behavior.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is flawed because it does not actually replace the question marks with any letters; it just checks for valid pairs of characters.
   - The program should iterate over all possible replacements of question marks and then check for the longest tandem repeat substring for each case.
3. The execution summary describes a function that checks for valid tandem repeats but does not handle the replacement of question marks or the maximization of the tandem repeat length.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
