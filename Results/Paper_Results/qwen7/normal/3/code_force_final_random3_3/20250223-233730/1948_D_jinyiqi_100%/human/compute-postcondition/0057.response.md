Postcondition: `count` is 2, `k` is 1, and `n` is greater than `j`, if the character at index `k` in string `s` is `'?'`, the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is `'?'`, or the character at index `k` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`. Otherwise, `count` is 0, `k` is 1, and `n` is greater than `j`.
