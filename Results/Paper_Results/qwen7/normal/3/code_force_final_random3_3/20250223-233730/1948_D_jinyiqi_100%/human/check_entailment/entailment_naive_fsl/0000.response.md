Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. Specifically, the program checks for tandem repeats by iterating through possible lengths and counting matching characters, but it does not ensure that all question marks are optimally replaced to form the longest possible tandem repeat.

For example, consider the input `"code?????s"`. The program will output `10`, which is incorrect because replacing the question marks to form `"codezzzzzs"` would result in a tandem repeat of length `12` (`"zzzzz"` repeated twice).

To fix this, the program needs to attempt different replacements of question marks to find the optimal solution, which is beyond the current implementation.
