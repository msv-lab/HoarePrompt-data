Based on the initial state provided:

- `count` is 3
- `k` is 2
- `n` must be greater than `j + 2`
- If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]` or if any of `s[k]` or `s[k + j]` is a question mark ('?'), then `count` remains 3 and `k` is 2.
- Otherwise, `count` is 0, `k` is 2, and `n` must be greater than `j + 2`.

Given these conditions, since `count` is explicitly stated to be 3, and there is no additional information about `s`, `j`, or `n` that would change this value, we can conclude that the value of `count` remains 3.

Therefore, the expression `count * 2` evaluates to `3 * 2`, which is 6.

Output: **6**
