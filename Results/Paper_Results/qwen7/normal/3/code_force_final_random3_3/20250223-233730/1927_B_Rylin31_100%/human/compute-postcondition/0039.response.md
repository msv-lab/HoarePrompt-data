Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the object `array`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `array`. Therefore, `j` will take on the value of each element in `array` during each iteration.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `array`**: The initial state of `array` is given as a list of integers from user input. For the loop to execute, `array` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` is initialized as `k + 2` and is not involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `ans` is an empty string and is not involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `s` is a list of `l` zeros and is not involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `array` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of `array`.

**State:**
**`array` must contain at least one element**
