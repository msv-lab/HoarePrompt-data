Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The variable `i` starts from 0 in the `range()` function.

3. **Determine the input state**: The value of `int(input())` is the number of test cases, which we denote as `t`. From the problem statement, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than the value of `int(input())`, which is `t`. Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should start at 0.
- `t` (the value of `int(input())`) must be greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
