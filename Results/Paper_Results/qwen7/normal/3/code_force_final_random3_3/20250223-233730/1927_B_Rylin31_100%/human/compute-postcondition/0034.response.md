Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 1`, and `int(input())` is the value of `l` (the input integer).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < l`. After the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 1`, and `l` is the input integer.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `l`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 to become `k + 2`. The value of `l` remains unchanged.

5. **Construct the new state**: The new state should reflect these changes.

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to each element in `array` in the list `s` with their respective counts, `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s` is a list of `l` zeros where each element in `array`-th position is incremented by its respective count, `l` is an input integer.**
