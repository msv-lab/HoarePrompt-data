Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters corresponding to the values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, `array` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input, `s` is now a list of `l` zeros, `l` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This changes the value of the `array` variable to a new list of integers obtained from the user input. All other variables (`i`, `ans`, `s`, `l`) remain unchanged with their initial values.
