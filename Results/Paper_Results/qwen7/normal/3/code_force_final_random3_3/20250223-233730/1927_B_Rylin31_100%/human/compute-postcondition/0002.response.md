Output State: **`i` is 0; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` containing `[0] * l`**

Explanation: The code creates a list `s` with `l` elements, where each element is `0`. Since `l` is an input integer, the exact contents of the list `s` depend on the value of `l`. For example, if `l` is 5, then `s` would be `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at `0`, and `l` retains its input integer value.
