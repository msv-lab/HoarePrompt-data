Output State: **`ans` is the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 97`, `j` is the first element of `array`, `array` is a non-empty list of integers.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the character that corresponds to the value of `s[j] + 97`. Here, `s` is assumed to be a list of integers, and `j` is the index of the first element in the list `array`. The value of `j` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated with the new character.
