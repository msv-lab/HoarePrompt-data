Output State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 'c', `s[j+1]` is `s[j+1] + 1`, `s` retains its original values, `j` is `initial_j + 1`, and `s[j]` is `s[j] + 1**.

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends a character to the string `ans`. The character is derived from the value of `s[j]` plus 97, which corresponds to the ASCII value of 'a'. Since `s[j]` was originally a value such that `s[j] + 97` resulted in the ASCII value of 'b' (which means `s[j]` was 98), now `s[j]` is incremented by 1, making it 99, which corresponds to 'c'. The other conditions remain unchanged.
