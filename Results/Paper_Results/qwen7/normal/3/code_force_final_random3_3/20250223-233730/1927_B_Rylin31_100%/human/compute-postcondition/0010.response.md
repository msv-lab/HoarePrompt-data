Output State: **`ans` is the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 98`, `j` is the second element of `array`, `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s[j]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` is still the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 98`, `j` is still the second element of `array`, and `array` remains a non-empty list of integers. The only change is that `s[j]` has been incremented by 1.
