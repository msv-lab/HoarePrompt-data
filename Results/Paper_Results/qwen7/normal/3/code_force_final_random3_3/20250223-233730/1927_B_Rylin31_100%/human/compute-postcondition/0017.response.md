Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `ans` is a string consisting of characters corresponding to the values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, where `s[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each iteration involving `j`.
- `j` takes on each value in `array` exactly once.
- `array` remains a non-empty list of integers.
- `s` is a list of integers.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `i` is used to iterate over the range defined by `int(input())`.
- The loop body is omitted, but we know that for each iteration of the loop, the value of `j` from `array` will be processed, incrementing the corresponding element in `s` by 1 and updating `ans` accordingly.

### State Adjustment
- Since the loop variable `i` is the only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration, we need to adjust the state of `i`.
- Initially, `i` starts at 0 (since `range(int(input()))` starts at 0).
- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value `k`.
2. For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

### Final State
- The state of `i` needs to be adjusted to `k + 1`.
- The states of `ans`, `s`, and `array` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### Conclusion
State: **`i` is k + 1, `ans` is a string consisting of characters corresponding to the values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, where `s[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each iteration involving `j`, `array` remains a non-empty list of integers, and `s` is a list of integers.**

In summary, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is k + 1, `ans` is a string consisting of characters corresponding to the values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, where `s[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each iteration involving `j`, `array` remains a non-empty list of integers, and `s` is a list of integers.**
