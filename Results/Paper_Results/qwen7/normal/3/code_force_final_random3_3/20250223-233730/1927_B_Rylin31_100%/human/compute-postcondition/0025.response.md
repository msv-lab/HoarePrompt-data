Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in array:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the index `j` in the list `s` (which is a list of `l` zeros)
   - `array` is a non-empty list of integers
   - `s` is a list of `l` zeros where the `j`-th element is now 1
   - `l` is an input integer
   - `j` is the first element of `array`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `array`, the value of `j` will change with each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the first element of `array`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be the second element of `array`.

4. **Update the states accordingly**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ans` will still contain the character corresponding to the new value of `j` in the list `s`.
   - `array` will remain the same, but `j` will change to the second element.
   - `s` will still be a list of `l` zeros with the new value of `j` marked as 1.
   - `l` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` changes to the second element of `array`.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the second element of `array` in the list `s`, `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s` is a list of `l` zeros where the second element of `array`-th element is now 1, `l` is an input integer, `j` is the second element of `array`**
