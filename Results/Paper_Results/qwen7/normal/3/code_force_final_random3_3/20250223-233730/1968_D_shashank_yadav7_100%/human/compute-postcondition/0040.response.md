Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is decreased by 1, and `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**.

This means that:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `k` is decreased by 1.
- The value of `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`.
- The value of `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`.
- The value of `bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`.
- The value of `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`.
