Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of `p[b]` decremented by 1. The value of `i` remains -1 as it was not affected by the code. The value of `n` remains a positive integer as it was not affected by the code. The value of `p[b]` is updated to `p[b] - 1`.
