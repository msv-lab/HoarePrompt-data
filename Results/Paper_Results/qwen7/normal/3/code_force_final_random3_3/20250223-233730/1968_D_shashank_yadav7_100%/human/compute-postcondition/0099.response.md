Output State: **`k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + 2 * a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + a[b]`**.

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by `a[b]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
