The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers t, n, k, P_B, P_S, and lists p and a. For each test case, it updates indices b and s based on permutations and iterates through the list a, calculating maximum values bm and sm under certain conditions. Finally, it prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison between bm and sm.
