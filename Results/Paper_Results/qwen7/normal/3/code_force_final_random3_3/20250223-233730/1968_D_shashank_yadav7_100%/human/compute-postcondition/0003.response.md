Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `p`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
