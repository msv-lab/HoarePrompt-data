Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into four integers and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
