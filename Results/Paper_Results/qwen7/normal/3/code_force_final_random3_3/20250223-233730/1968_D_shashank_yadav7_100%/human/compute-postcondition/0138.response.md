Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is the same as before, `sm` is the same as before, `bm` is the same as before, `bp` is `bp + a[b]**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 0, after decrementing, `i` becomes -1. The values of `n`, `p[b]`, `s`, `sm`, `bm`, and `bp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
