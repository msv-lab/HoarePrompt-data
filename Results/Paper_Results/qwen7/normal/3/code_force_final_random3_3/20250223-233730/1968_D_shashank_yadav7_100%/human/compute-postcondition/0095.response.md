Output State: **`k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + 2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + a[b]`, `i` is `i_prev + 3`.**

Explanation: The code `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` by subtracting 1 from `p[s]`. Initially, `s` is defined as `p[s] - 1 - 1`, so after the code executes, `s` becomes `p[s] - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
