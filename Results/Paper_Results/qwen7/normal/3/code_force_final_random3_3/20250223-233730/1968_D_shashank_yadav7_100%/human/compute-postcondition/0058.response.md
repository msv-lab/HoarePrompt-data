Output State: **`i` is `n`, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 2^(n-1)`, `s` is `p[s] - 2^(n-1)`, `bm` is the maximum value of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` after `n` iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` after `n` iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` added `n` times to `sp`, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` added `n` times to `bp`, and `t` must be greater than `n`; `n` is updated to an input integer, `k` is updated to 0, `b` is updated to an input integer, `s` is updated to an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `b`, and `s` from the input using `input().split()`. These values replace the previous values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. The values of `i`, `bm`, `sp`, `bp`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
