Output State: `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 2^(n-1)`, `s` is `p[s] - 2^(n-1)`, `bm` is the maximum value of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` after `n` iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` after `n` iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` added `n` times to `sp`, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` added `n` times to `bp`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`. The variable `k` will have been decremented `n` times and will now be 0. The variable `b` will have been updated `n` times by subtracting `2^(n-1)` from `p[b]`, and similarly, `s` will have been updated `n` times by subtracting `2^(n-1)` from `p[s]`. The variables `bm` and `sm` will hold their respective maximum values after `n` iterations of the loop, with each iteration updating these values based on the current `k` and the accumulated `bp` and `sp`. The variables `sp` and `bp` will each be incremented `n` times, adding `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, to their initial values.
