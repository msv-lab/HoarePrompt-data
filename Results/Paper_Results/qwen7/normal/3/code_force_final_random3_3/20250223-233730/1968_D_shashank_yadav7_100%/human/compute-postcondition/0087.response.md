Output State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1 - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` adds the value of `a[s]` to `sp`. Since `sp` was previously `a[s] + sp`, adding `a[s]` again means `sp` now becomes `a[s] + sp + a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
