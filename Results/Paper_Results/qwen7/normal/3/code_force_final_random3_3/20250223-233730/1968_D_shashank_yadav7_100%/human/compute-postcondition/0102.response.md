Postcondition: `k` is `-n - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - n`, `s` is `p[s] - n`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` after the last iteration, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` after the last iteration, `sp` is `a[s] + sp + n * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + n * a[b]`, `i` is `n + 1`. Additionally, the condition `bm` is greater than `sm` holds true.
