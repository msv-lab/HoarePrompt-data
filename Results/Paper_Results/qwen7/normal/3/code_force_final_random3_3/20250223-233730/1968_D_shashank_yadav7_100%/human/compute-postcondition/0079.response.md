Output State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `i` is `i_prev + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to -1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
