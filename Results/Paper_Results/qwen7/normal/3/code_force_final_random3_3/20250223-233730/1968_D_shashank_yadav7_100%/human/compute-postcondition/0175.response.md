Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t, n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a. t is an integer ranging from 1 to 10^4. For each testcase, n and k are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, P_B and P_S are integers with 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n, and n ≤ 2⋅10^5. p is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns a value based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.**
