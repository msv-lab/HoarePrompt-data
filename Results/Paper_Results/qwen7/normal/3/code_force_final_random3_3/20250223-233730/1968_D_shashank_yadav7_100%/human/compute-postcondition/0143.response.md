Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the same as before, `bm` is the same as before, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`.**

Explanation: The code `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` to be `p[s] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
