Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, and `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `bm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`.**

The code updates `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. Since the values of `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp` are not specified, we keep them in their general form. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
