Output State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1 - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**

Explanation: The code updates `bm` to be the maximum value between its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`. Given that `k` is -1, `bm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * (-1) + bp`, which simplifies to `bm` being updated to the maximum of its current value and `-a[b] + bp`. The other variables remain unchanged.
