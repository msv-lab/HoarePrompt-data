Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. Since `s` is defined as `p[s] - 1`, the expression `a[s] * k + sp` is used to update `sm`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `bm`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
