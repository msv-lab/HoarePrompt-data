Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is decremented by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`.**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `sm` and `bm` are updated to consider the new value of `sp`.
