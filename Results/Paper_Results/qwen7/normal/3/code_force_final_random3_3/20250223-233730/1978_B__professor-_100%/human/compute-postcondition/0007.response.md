Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer with the current value of `b` being greater than `a`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement: `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

Given:
- `b > a`
- `b - a >= n`

Let's break down the expression:
1. `2 * b`: This is simply twice the value of `b`.
2. `- n + 1`: Subtract `n` from 1.
3. Multiply the result by `n`: This scales the previous result by `n`.
4. Use integer division by 2 (`// 2`): This rounds down to the nearest integer.

Since `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`, the value of `b` is at least `a + n`. Therefore, `2 * b - n + 1` will be at least `2 * (a + n) - n + 1 = 2a + 2n - n + 1 = 2a + n + 1`.

When this value is multiplied by `n` and then integer-divided by 2, it will produce a specific integer value depending on the actual values of `a` and `n`, but the key point is that it will be a valid integer.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)**
