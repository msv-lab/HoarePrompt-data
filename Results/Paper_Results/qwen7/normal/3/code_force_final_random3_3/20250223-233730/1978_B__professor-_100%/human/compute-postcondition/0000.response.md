Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means `t` now holds the number of test cases, but no further details about each test case (like `n`, `a`, and `b`) are known yet. Therefore, the only updated information is that `t` is now set to the input integer representing the number of test cases.
