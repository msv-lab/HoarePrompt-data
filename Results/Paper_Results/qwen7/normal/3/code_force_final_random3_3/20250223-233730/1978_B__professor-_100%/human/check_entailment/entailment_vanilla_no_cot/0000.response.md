Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given promotion rules. Let's break down why the program is correct:

1. **Case when \( b \leq a \)**:
   - If the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (\( b \)) is less than or equal to the usual price (\( a \)), then it is always better to sell all buns at the usual price (\( a \)).
   - The profit in this case is \( n \times a \).

2. **Case when \( b - a < n \)**:
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price (\( b - a \)) is less than the number of buns (\( n \)), then it is optimal to sell the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price.
   - The total profit is calculated as the sum of the arithmetic series for the first \( b - a + 1 \) terms plus the usual price for the remaining buns.

3. **Case when \( b - a \geq n \)**:
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price (\( b - a \)) is greater than or equal to the number of buns (\( n \)), then it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified prices.
   - The total profit is the sum of the arithmetic series for \( n \) terms.

The program correctly handles these cases and calculates the profit accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct.
