Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic inside the loop checks different conditions to calculate the maximum profit:
   - If `b <= a`, it means there's no benefit in applying the promotion, so it simply prints `n * a`.
   - If `b - a >= n`, it suggests that the promotion would not cover more than `n` buns, so it calculates the sum of an arithmetic series using the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and adds the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.

Given the problem statement and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all the specified conditions and constraints correctly.

Correctness: **True**
