Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of three positive integers: n (number of buns), a (usual price of a bun), and b (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). For each test case, it calculates and returns the total revenue generated from selling all buns.**

This means the function will take multiple sets of inputs (each set containing n, a, and b) and for each set, compute the total revenue by considering the usual price for most buns and the modified price for the first bun. The function then returns the total revenue for each test case.
