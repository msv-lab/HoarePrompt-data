Output: **int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)**

Explanation:
- `t` is mentioned but not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer and its value is less than or equal to `a`.

The expression `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `b - a` positive integers. This is because the formula \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\) gives the sum of the first `k` positive integers, and here `k = b - a`.

Adding `a * n` to this result gives the final value that will be printed. Therefore, the output is the integer value of the expression \(\text{int}((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)\).
