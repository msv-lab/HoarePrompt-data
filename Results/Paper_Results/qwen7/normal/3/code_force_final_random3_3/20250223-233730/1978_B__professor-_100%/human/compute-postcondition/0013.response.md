Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.

### Loop Head
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head does not explicitly mention any variables. However, since the loop runs `t` times, the variable `t` is implicitly involved in determining the number of iterations.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Each iteration of the loop decrements `t` by 1.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
- **Initial Value of `t`**: Since `t` must be greater than 0, it means `t` was at least 1 at the start of the loop.
- **Decrement of `t`**: After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` will be `t - 1`.

### Adjusted States
- **`t`**: It will be reduced by 1 from its previous value.
- **Other Variables (`n`, `a`, `b`)**: These variables are not directly modified by the loop itself (no operations on these variables are mentioned in the loop body), so they remain unchanged.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `t` must be greater than 0 (reduced by 1 from its previous value).
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `b` remains the same.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (reduced by 1 from its previous value), `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.
