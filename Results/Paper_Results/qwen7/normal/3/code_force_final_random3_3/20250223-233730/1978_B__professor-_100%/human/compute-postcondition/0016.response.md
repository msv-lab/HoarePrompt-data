Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is `t-1`, but since `t` is not used in the print statement, we can ignore this information.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `b` is an input integer.

The print statement evaluates the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` and converts the result to an integer before printing it.

Let's break down the expression step by step:

1. `2 * b`: This multiplies the value of `b` by 2.
2. `- n + 1`: This subtracts `n` from the result of the previous step and then adds 1.
3. `* n`: This multiplies the result of the previous step by `n`.
4. `// 2`: This performs integer division by 2, which means any fractional part is discarded.

Given that `n` and `b` are input integers, the expression will yield an integer result after performing these operations.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of the evaluated expression.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)**
