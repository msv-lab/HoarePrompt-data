Output State: **`card` is no longer used, `rank` is the rank part of the original `card`, `suit` is the suit part of the original `card`, `trumps` is unchanged, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`, and `answers` contains one more element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `None` and `rank` with a space in between.**

Explanation: The code `suits[suit] = rank` updates the value of `suits[suit]` to `rank`. Since `suits[suit]` was previously either `None` or already set to `rank`, it gets updated to `rank`. Additionally, `answers` contains one more element, which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `None` (if it was `None`) and `rank` with a space in between.
