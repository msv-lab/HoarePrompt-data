Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of `card`; `suit` is the suit part of `card`, and the suit is not equal to `trump`; `suits[suit]` is None; `answers` now contains one more element which is the result of ' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]).**

Explanation: The code `suits[suit] = None` changes the value of `suits[suit]` to `None`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
