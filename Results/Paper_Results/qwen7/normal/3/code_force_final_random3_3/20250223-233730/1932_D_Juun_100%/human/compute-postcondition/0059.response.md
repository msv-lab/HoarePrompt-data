Output State: **`trumps` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `suit` is `next_suit`, `rank` is `next_rank`, `answers` has a new element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()', we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop will proceed to the next iteration without executing the remaining code in the current iteration. Therefore, the values of `trumps`, `suit`, `rank`, and `answers` remain unchanged from their previous states, and the loop continues.
