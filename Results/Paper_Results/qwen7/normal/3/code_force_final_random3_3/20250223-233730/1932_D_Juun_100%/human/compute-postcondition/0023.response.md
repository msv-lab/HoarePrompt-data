Output State: **`card` is no longer used, `rank` is the rank part of the original `card`, `suit` is the suit part of the original `card`, `trumps` is unchanged, `answers` now contains one more element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` (if it's `None`) or `rank` and `suit` with a space in between.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `answers` list. This element is a string created by joining two elements: the sorted values of `suits[suit]` (if it is `None`) or `rank` and `suit`. The elements are joined with a space in between. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
