Postcondition: `card` is no longer used, `rank` is the rank part of the original `card`, `suit` is the suit part of the original `card`, `trumps` is unchanged, and `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`. `answers` now contains one additional element. If `suit` matches `trump`, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank` and `answers` contains a string formed by joining the sorted values of `None` and `rank` with a space in between if `suits[suit]` was `None`, otherwise `suits[suit]` is set to `rank` and `answers` contains the new value. If `suit` does not match `trump`, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank` and `answers` contains the new value.
