Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trumps` is an empty list, `trump` is the input from the user.**

The code initializes an empty list named `trumps`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `trump`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
