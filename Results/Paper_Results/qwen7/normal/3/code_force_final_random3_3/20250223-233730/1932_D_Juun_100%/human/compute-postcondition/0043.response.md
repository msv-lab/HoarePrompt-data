Output State: **The `suits` dictionary has at least one key-value pair; the rank is `None`. We continue the loop or iteration we were in.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `suits` or `rank`, their states remain unchanged.
