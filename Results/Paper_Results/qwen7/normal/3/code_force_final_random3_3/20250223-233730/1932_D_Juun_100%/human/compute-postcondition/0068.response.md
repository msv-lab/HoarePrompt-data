Output State: **`trumps` is a sorted list of its original elements in descending order, `suits` remains unchanged, and `answers` contains all valid pairs of ranks for each suit where both ranks were found, formatted as strings like 'rank1suit1 trumps.pop()trump' for each iteration.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `trumps` list in descending order using the `sorted()` function with the `reverse=True` parameter. This means that the elements in `trumps` will be arranged from highest to lowest. The `suits` dictionary and the `answers` list remain unchanged as they were not affected by the sorting operation.
