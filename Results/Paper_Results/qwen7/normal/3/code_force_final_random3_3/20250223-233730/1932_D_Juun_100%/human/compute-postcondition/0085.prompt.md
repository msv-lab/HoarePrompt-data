You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS". The third line of each test case contains 2n unique cards, each described by a two-character string where the first character is the rank ("23456789") and the second character is the suit ("CDHS").
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: All cards have been processed, `trumps` contains all ranks of cards that match the `trump` suit, `suits` dictionary has been updated such that for each suit, either `None` is stored (indicating no valid rank was found for that suit) or the highest rank found for that suit is stored, and `answers` contains all valid pairs of ranks for each suit where both ranks were found.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged, `trumps` is an empty list since it has been iterated over completely, `answers` contains all valid pairs of ranks for each suit where both ranks were found, formatted as strings like 'rank1suit1 trumps.pop()trump' for each iteration.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` remains unchanged, and `answers` contains all valid pairs of ranks for each suit where both ranks were found, formatted as strings like 'rank1suit1 trumps.pop()trump' for each iteration until no more pairs can be formed.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `trumps` is not empty. Each iteration of the loop pops two elements from `trumps` and prints them in the specified format. Since the loop removes elements from `trumps` in each iteration, it will continue until `trumps` is empty. At that point, the loop terminates, leaving `trumps` as an empty list. The value of `suits` remains unchanged throughout the loop, and `answers` accumulates all valid pairs of ranks for each suit that were found during the iterations.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` remains unchanged, and `answers` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a list of cards and updates variables `trumps`, `suit`, and `rank`. It also appends a formatted string to the `answers` list. The function does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return anything as there is no value being returned in the given code snippet.

Case_2: The program does not return any value as there is no value being returned in the given code snippet.

Case_3: The program returns nothing since there is no return statement in the given code snippet. The list `trumps` has one element less than before, `suit` is updated to `next_suit`, `rank` is updated to `next_rank`, and `answers` has a new element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()'. The loop continues.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
