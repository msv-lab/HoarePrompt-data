Output State: **All cards have been processed, `trumps` contains all ranks of cards that match the `trump` suit, `suits` dictionary has been updated such that for each suit, either `None` is stored (indicating no valid rank was found for that suit) or the highest rank found for that suit is stored, and `answers` contains all valid pairs of ranks for each suit where both ranks were found.**

In this final state, the loop has processed all the input cards. The `trumps` list will contain all ranks of cards that matched the `trump` suit during the loop's execution. The `suits` dictionary will have been updated for each suit to either `None` if no valid rank was found for that suit, or to the highest rank found for that suit if a valid rank was found. The `answers` list will contain all valid pairs of ranks for each suit where both ranks were found, formatted as strings with the ranks joined by their suit symbol.
