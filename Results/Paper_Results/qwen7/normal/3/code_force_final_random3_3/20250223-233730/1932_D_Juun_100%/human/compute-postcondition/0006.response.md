Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of `card`; `suit` is the suit part of `card`.**

Explanation: The code `rank, suit = card` unpacks the tuple `card` into two variables, `rank` and `suit`. This means that `rank` now holds the first element of the tuple `card`, and `suit` holds the second element of the tuple `card`. All other information about the initial state remains unchanged.
