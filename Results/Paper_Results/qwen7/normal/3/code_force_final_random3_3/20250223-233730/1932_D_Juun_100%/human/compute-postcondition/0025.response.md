Output State: **`card` is no longer used, `rank` is the rank part of the original `card`, `suit` is the suit part of the original `card`, `trumps` is unchanged, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`**

Explanation: The code `suits[suit] = rank` updates the dictionary `suits` by setting the value at key `suit` to `rank`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
