Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the trump suit and the list of 2n cards.
3. It initializes dictionaries and lists to keep track of the suits, ranks, and answers.
4. It iterates through the cards, updating the suits dictionary and the answers list based on the rules provided.
5. After processing all the cards, it ensures that all trump cards are paired with non-trump cards or other trump cards, if necessary.
6. The logic handles the scenario where a solution is impossible by printing "IMPOSSIBLE" and returning early.
7. The final output matches the expected format, ensuring that each pair of cards is printed in the correct order.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
