#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS". The third line of each test case contains 2n unique cards, each described by a two-character string where the first character is the rank ("23456789") and the second character is the suit ("CDHS").
def func_1():

    #State: All cards have been processed, `trumps` contains all ranks of cards that match the `trump` suit, `suits` dictionary has been updated such that for each suit, either `None` is stored (indicating no valid rank was found for that suit) or the highest rank found for that suit is stored, and `answers` contains all valid pairs of ranks for each suit where both ranks were found.

    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `trumps` is not empty. Each iteration of the loop pops two elements from `trumps` and prints them in the specified format. Since the loop removes elements from `trumps` in each iteration, it will continue until `trumps` is empty. At that point, the loop terminates, leaving `trumps` as an empty list. The value of `suits` remains unchanged throughout the loop, and `answers` accumulates all valid pairs of ranks for each suit that were found during the iterations.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` remains unchanged, and `answers` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of cards based on a specified trump suit. It identifies valid pairs of ranks for each suit, updates a list of remaining trump ranks, and prints these pairs along with the remaining trump ranks in a specific format. The function does not return any value.
