Based on the initial state provided:

- `trumps` is a non-empty list with one element less than before.
- `suit` is `next_suit`.
- `rank` is `next_rank`.
- `answers` has a new element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()'.
- We continue the loop.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('IMPOSSIBLE')
```

This print statement will simply output the string 'IMPOSSIBLE'. The values of `trumps`, `suit`, `rank`, and `answers` are not relevant to this particular print statement, as it does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
