Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for card in input().split():`. The variables involved in the loop head are `card`.

2. **Understand the postconditions given**: 
   - `card` is no longer used.
   - `rank` is the rank part of the original `card`.
   - `suit` is the suit part of the original `card`.
   - `trumps` is unchanged.
   - `suits[suit]` is set to either `None` with `answers` containing one more element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `None` and `rank` with a space in between, or `suits[suit]` is set to `rank` with `answers` containing one more element if `suits[suit]` is `None`, otherwise `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each `card` from the input, at the start of the next iteration, the next `card` will be processed.
   - The `card` variable will be updated to the next value from the input split.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `card` will be the next card from the input.
   - `rank` will be the rank part of the new `card`.
   - `suit` will be the suit part of the new `card`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The state at the start of the next iteration will be based on the next `card` from the input, with `rank` and `suit` derived from this new `card`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`card` is the next card from the input, `rank` is the rank part of the new `card`, `suit` is the suit part of the new `card`, `trumps` is unchanged, and `suits[suit]` is set to either `None` with `answers` containing one more element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `None` and `rank` with a space in between, or `suits[suit]` is set to `rank` with `answers` containing one more element if `suits[suit]` is `None`, otherwise `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`**.
