Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for n in qs:`. This means the variables `n` and `qs` are involved in the loop head.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` is the first element in `qs`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `qs`. Since `n` is the first element in `qs` at the start of the loop, the loop will continue if there are more elements in `qs` after the first one.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `q` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `p` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `qs` will now contain all elements except the first one (since `n` was the first element in `qs` and the loop processes it).
   - `n` will be the second element in `qs` (if `qs` had more than one element).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (with the first element removed), `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the second element in `qs`**.
