Functionality: **The function accepts parameters k (a positive integer), q (a positive integer), p (a list of k positive integers representing a sequence a), qs (a list of q positive integers representing n_i), and n (a positive integer). The function returns a value based on the conditions specified in the output cases.**

To break it down further:
- The function accepts five parameters: `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, and `n`.
- `k` and `q` are positive integers with a range of 1 to 100.
- `p` is a list of `k` positive integers that form a strictly increasing sequence with each element between 1 and 100.
- `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers, each between 1 and 100.
- `n` is a positive integer with a range of 1 to 100.
- Based on the values of `p`, `qs`, and `n`, the function returns a specific value according to the defined cases.
