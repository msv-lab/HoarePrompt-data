Based on the initial state provided:

- `qs` is a list of integers from a new input string, and it must have at least one element.
- `n` is the first element of `qs`.
- `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Let's break down the steps:

1. `res` is a list that contains a single element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`. Here, `n` is the first element of `qs`, and `p` is an unknown parameter passed to `func_1`.

2. `map(str, res)` converts the single element in `res` to a string.

3. `' '.join(map(str, res))` joins these string elements with a space separator.

Since `res` contains only one element (the result of `func_1(n, p)`), the joined string will simply be the string representation of this single element.

Therefore, the output will be the string representation of the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **'result_of_func_1(n, p)' (where result_of_func_1(n, p) is the string representation of the value returned by func_1(n, p))**
