Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the first element in `qs`.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Here, `n` is the first element in the list `qs`, which is obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, and `n` remain unchanged, but `res` now contains the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)`.
