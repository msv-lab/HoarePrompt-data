Output State: `qs` is a list of integers from the new input string, `n` is the first element of `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element of `qs`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `qs` will still hold the list of integers from the new input string, `n` will be the first element of `qs` (or undefined if `qs` is empty), and `res` will be a list where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, p)` for every `n` in `qs`.
