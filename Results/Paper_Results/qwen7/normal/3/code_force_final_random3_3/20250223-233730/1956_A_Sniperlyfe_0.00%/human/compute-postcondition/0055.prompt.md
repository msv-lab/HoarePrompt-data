You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k and q are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100; p is a list of k positive integers representing the sequence a where 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100; qs is a list of q positive integers representing n_i where 1 <= n_i <= 100; n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = []
        
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `k` and `q` are positive integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the final input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the final input string and converted to integers, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the final `qs`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters k (a positive integer), q (a positive integer), p (a list of k positive integers representing a sequence a), qs (a list of q positive integers representing n_i), and n (a positive integer). The function returns a value based on the conditions specified in the output cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
