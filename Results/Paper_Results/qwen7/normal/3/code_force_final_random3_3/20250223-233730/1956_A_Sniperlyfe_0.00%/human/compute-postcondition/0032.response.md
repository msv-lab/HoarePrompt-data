Based on the initial state provided:

- `qs` must have at least one element.
- `n` is the first element in `qs`.
- `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `n` is the first element of `qs`.
2. `res` is a list that contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it. Since `n` is the first element of `qs`, `res` will be `[func_1(n, p)]`.

When the `print` statement executes, it will join the elements of `res` into a single string separated by spaces and then print that string.

Output: **func_1([n], p) (where n is the first element of qs and p is an unspecified parameter passed to func_1)**
