Output State: **`res` contains the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the third element of `qs`, and `qs` still has at least two elements.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The value of `n` remains the third element of `qs`, and `qs` still has at least two elements as required.
