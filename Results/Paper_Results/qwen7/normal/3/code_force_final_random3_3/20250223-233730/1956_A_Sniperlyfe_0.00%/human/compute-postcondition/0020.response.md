Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string and converted to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (with all elements remaining), `k` and `q` are assigned the values from the split input string, both converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `p`. The variables `t`, `k`, `q`, `qs`, and the assignments of `k` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state.
