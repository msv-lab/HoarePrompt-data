Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (with the first two elements removed), `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the third element in `qs`, and `func_1(n, p)` has been appended to `res`.**

In this output state, the value of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `res`, and `n` remain unchanged except that `res` now contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended twice.
