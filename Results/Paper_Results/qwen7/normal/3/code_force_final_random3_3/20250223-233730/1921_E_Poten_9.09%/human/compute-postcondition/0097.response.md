Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `clues[2]` is not even, `clues[4]` is not even, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and `clues[3]` is less than or equal to `clues[5]`. Additionally, the condition inside the if statement determines whether 'Draw' or 'Alice' is appended to the `answers` list.**
