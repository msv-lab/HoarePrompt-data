Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` is an empty list, so after appending `'Draw'`, it contains one element, `'Draw'`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2) due to the nature of the provided example, although the exact increment operation was not shown in the snippet. The precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and `clues` is assumed to be updated to a list of integers from the user's input, which was already processed before the given code snippet.
