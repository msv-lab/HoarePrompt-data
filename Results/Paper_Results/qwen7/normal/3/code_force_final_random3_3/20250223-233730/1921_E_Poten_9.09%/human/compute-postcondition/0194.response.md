Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' depending on the condition evaluated in the if statement, `i` is 4, and `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces. If `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or if `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.
