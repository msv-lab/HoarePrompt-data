Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', and 'Alice', and `i` is set to 4. Whether the condition in the if statement or the else statement is met, 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if either `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true (in the if part, these conditions are checked directly, while in the else part, they are checked with a difference of 1). Otherwise, `answers` remains unchanged.
