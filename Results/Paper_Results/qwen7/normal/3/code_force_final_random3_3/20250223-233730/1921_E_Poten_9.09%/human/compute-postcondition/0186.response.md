Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice', `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces, input is taken to convert strings to integers and stored in `clues`.**

Explanation: The code takes input from the user, splits it by spaces, and converts each string to an integer using `map(int, input().split(' '))`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `clues`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `answers`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
