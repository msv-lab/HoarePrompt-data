Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice', `i` is 4, and the following conditions apply:
- If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', either 'Bob' or 'Alice'.
- Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`.
- Otherwise, `answers` becomes ['Alice', 'Draw', 'Bob'].
