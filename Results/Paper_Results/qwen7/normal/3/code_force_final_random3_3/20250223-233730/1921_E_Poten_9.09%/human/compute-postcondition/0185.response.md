The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `test_cases`. If `i` is less than `test_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `test_cases` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `test_cases` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice', `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces**
