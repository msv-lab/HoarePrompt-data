Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after the increment (which is not shown in the snippet but implied by the initial state), `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
