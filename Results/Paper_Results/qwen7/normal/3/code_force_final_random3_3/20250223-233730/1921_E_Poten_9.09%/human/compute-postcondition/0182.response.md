Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob' or 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0)` is true or false, the final state of the variables will be such that `test_cases` remains greater than 0, `answers` will contain either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice', `i` will be 2, and `clues` will be a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.
