Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, and `clues[2]` is not even, `clues[4]` is not even. If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` is set to ['Alice']. Otherwise, depending on whether the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` contains either 'Draw' or 'Alice'.
