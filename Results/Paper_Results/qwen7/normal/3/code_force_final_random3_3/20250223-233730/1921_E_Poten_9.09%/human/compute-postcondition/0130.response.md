Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', 'Alice', or ['Draw', 'Bob'], `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, and `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd. Depending on the conditions within the if and else blocks, `answers` will be set to 'Bob', 'Draw', 'Alice', or ['Draw', 'Bob'] as follows:
- If `clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0` or `clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0`, and if `clues[3] == clues[5]`, `answers` will contain 'Bob'. Otherwise, `answers` will contain 'Draw' if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. If the condition is false, `answers` will be set to either ['Draw'], ['Bob'], or ['Draw', 'Bob'] based on the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues being greater than 1 or other specified conditions involving the differences between the second and fourth clues and the third and fifth clues.
- If the above conditions are not met, and `clues[2]` is not even, `clues[4]` is not even, and `clues[3] == clues[5]`, `answers` is set to ['Alice']. Otherwise, depending on whether the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` contains either 'Draw' or 'Alice'.
