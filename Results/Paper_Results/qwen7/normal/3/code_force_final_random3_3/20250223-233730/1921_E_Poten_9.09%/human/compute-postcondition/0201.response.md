Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' with 'Draw' appended, `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 because the list `answers` grows by one element, making `i` equal to 4. The initial conditions for `test_cases` and `clues` remain valid.
