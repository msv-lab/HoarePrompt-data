Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', 'Draw', and 'Bob', `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either `'Alice'`, `'Draw'`, or `'Bob'`. After appending `'Bob'`, `answers` now contains `'Alice'`, `'Draw'`, and `'Bob'`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 because it was initially 3, so now it is 4. The precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 3 remains unchanged, and the list `clues` remains as a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.
