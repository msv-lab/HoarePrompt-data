Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then `clues` remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.
