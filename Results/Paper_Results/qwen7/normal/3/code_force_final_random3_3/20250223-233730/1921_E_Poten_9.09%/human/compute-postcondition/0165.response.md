Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Alice')` adds the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `i` is 1, so after the increment (which is not shown in the snippet but implied by the initial state), `i` becomes 2. The initial state of `test_cases` being greater than 0 and `clues` being a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces remains unchanged.
