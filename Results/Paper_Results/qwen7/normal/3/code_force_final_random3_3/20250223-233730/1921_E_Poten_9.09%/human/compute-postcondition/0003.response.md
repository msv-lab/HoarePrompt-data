Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `clues`. The initial state of `test_cases` being greater than 0, `answers` being an empty list, and `i` being 0 remains unchanged. The new variable `clues` is created and populated with the integers from the user's input.
