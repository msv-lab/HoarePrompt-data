Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' with 'Draw' appended, `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The initial state of `answers` contains either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice'. After appending `'Draw'`, the list `answers` now contains these elements plus the newly added `'Draw'`. Additionally, the variable `i` is incremented by 1 (from 3 to 4) because the line `i += 1` is not present in the given code snippet. The conditions and values of `test_cases` and `clues` remain unchanged.
