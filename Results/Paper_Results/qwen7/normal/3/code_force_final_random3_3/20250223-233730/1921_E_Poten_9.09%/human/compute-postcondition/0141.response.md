Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `i` was set to 1, so after the increment (which is implied by the next logical step), `i` becomes 2. The initial state of `clues` being a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces remains unchanged. The precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 also remains valid.
