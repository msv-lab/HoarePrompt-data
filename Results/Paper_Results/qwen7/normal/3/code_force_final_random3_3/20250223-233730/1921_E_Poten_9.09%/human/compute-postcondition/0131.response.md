Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces. The first clue is not equal to 1, the third clue is less than or equal to the fifth clue, and either both the third and fifth clues are even numbers or both are odd numbers. Depending on the conditions, `answers` will contain one of the following: 'Bob', 'Draw', ['Draw', 'Bob'], 'Draw', or 'Alice'. Specifically, if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, `answers` will contain 'Bob' or ['Bob']. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` will contain 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the comparisons involving the differences between the clues.
