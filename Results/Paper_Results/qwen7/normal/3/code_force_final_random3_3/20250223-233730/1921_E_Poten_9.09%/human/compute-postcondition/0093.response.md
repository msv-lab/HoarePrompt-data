Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `clues[2]` is not even, `clues[4]` is not even, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `clues[3]` is less than or equal to `clues[5]`, and `(clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 ≤ abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) and clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 ≤ abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))`.
