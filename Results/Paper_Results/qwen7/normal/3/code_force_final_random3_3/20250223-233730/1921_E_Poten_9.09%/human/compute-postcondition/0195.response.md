Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' with 'Draw' appended, `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts. If the condition `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, then `answers` will contain 'Draw' appended to it. Otherwise, `answers` will contain 'Alice', 'Draw', and 'Bob'. In both cases, `test_cases` remains greater than 3, `i` becomes 4, and `clues` remains a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.
