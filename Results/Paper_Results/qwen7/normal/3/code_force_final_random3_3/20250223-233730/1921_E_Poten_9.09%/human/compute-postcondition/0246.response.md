Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of six integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), \(y_b\). Based on specific conditions involving these integers, it appends either 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw' to a list named `answers`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of the `answers` list. The final state of the program is that `answers` contains at least three elements, each being either 'Bob', 'Alice', or 'Draw', corresponding to the outcome of each test case.**
