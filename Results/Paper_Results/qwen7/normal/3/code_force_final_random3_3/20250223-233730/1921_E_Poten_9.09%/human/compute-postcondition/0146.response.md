Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The initial value of `i` was 1, so after the increment (even though there's no explicit increment operation shown, it can be inferred that `i` would be incremented to 2 after appending to `answers`), `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
