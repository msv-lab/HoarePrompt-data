Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `clues[2]` is not even, `clues[4]` is not even, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`, and whether the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1 depends on the condition `clues[3] > clues[5]`.
