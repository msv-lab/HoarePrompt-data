Output State: **`t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t` and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
