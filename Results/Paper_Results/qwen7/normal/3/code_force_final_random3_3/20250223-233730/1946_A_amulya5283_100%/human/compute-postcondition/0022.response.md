Output State: **`total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an integer greater than `mdx` and not equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is 3, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and the middle index `mdx` of the list `a` has the same value as the index `i + 1`, and `i` is `mdx + 1**.

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Initially, `res` was 2, so after executing the code, `res` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
