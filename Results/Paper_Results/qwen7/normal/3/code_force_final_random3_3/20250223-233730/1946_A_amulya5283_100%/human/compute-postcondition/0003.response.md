Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` will hold the integer value entered by the user. The condition for `t` remains unchanged as the code does not affect the value of `t`.
