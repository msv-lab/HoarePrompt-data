Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to be its sorted version.
