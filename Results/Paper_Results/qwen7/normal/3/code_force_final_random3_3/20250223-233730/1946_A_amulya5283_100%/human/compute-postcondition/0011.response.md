Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop runs from `mdx` to `n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `mdx` must be less than `n`.

3. **Analyze the Given States**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`: This condition seems contradictory unless `t` is 1, but since `t` cannot be 1 (as per the given state), this part doesn't directly affect the loop.
   - `n` is an integer not equal to 1: This is fine as the loop requires `n` to be an integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers: This is not relevant to the loop conditions.
   - `res` is 0: This is not relevant to the loop conditions.
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`: We need to check if this value is less than `n`.

4. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since `mdx` is defined as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, we need to ensure that `mdx < n` for the loop to execute.
   - `n` must be greater than `mdx` for the loop to run.

5. **Calculate `mdx`**:
   - `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`
   - For `mdx < n` to hold true, `n` must be greater than `mdx`.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:

- Ensure `n` is greater than `mdx`.
- Ensure `n` is an integer and not equal to 1.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an integer greater than `mdx` and not equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `res` is 0, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`**
