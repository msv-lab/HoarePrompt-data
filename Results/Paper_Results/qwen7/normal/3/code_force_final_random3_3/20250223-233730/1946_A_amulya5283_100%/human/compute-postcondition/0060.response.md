Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is equal to `t - 1`. This implies that `t` is being set to a value that is one less than its previous value, but the exact value of `t` before this operation is not specified. Since no specific value for `t` is given, we can only say that after the operation, `t` is one less than its original value.
- `n` is an input integer, meaning it is a value that will be provided by the user during runtime.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, split from a single input string and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.

The `print(1)` statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Given the above information, the output of the `print(1)` statement is:

Output: **1**
