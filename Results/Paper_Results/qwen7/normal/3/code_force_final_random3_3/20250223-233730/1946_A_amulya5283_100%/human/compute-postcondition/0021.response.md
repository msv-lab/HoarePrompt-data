Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range specified by `mdx` to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an integer greater than `mdx` and not equal to 1.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `res` is 2.
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - The middle index `mdx` of the list `a` has the same value as the index `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `mdx`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `mdx + 1`.

5. **Update the other relevant states**:
   - `mdx` remains unchanged since it is based on `n` and does not change within the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change within the loop.
   - `a` remains a sorted list of integers.
   - `res` remains 2.
   - `total` remains greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.

Given these considerations, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an integer greater than `mdx` and not equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is 2, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and the middle index `mdx` of the list `a` has the same value as the index `i + 1`, and `i` is `mdx + 1**.
