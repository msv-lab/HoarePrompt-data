Output State: **`res` is `res + 1`, `i` is `mdx`, `n` must be greater than `mdx`, the value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` remains `mdx`, `n` must still be greater than `mdx`, and the value of `a[mdx]` remains equal to the current value of `a[i]`.
