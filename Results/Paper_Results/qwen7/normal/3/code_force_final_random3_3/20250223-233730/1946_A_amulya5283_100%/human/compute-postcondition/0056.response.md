Output State: **`t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string**.

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, making `t` equal to `t - 1`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
