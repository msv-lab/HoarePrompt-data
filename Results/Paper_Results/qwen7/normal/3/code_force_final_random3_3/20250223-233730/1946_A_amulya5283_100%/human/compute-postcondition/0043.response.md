Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(mdx, n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition at the end of the previous iteration is:
   - `i` is `mdx`.
   - `n` must be greater than `mdx`.
   - If `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is incremented by 1.
   - If `a[mdx]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mdx`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `mdx + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `mdx`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` changes from `mdx` to `mdx + 1`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `mdx + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than `mdx`.

State: **`i` is `mdx + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mdx`**
