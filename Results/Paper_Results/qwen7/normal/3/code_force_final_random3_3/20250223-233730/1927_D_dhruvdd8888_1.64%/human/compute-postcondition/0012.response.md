Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 200000, `s` is 0, and `arr` contains one element (1 + s, 0, num). This is because if the first element of `nums` is not equal to `num`, then `arr` is updated to contain one element (1 + s, 0, num). Since there is no else part, this condition holds regardless of the if statement's outcome.
