Output State: **`i` is 3, `N` is between 2 and 200000 inclusive, `s` is 2, `arr` contains three elements \([(1, 1, 0), (2, 2, num), (3, 3, num)]\)**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple \((1 + s, i, num)\) to the list `arr`. Given that `s` is 2 and `i` is 3, the new tuple becomes \((3, 3, num)\). The value of `num` is taken from `nums[2]`, but since `nums` is not defined in the initial state, we keep it as `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.
