Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `N + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < N + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is between 2 and 200000 inclusive
   - `s` is 0
   - `arr` contains one element (1 + s, 0, num), where `num` is equal to `nums[0]`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `N` is not explicitly given, but it is implied that `N` is the upper limit of the loop, which is `n - 1` based on the initial conditions.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 200000 inclusive, `s` is 0, `arr` contains one element (1 + s, 0, num)**
