Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(N + 1):`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 0` because `range(N + 1)` generates numbers from `0` to `N`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N + 1`. Since `N` is defined as `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)), the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[0, N]`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that `i` starts at `0` and that `N` (which is `n`) is valid.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**State:**
- `i` is `0`
- `n` (which is `N`) must be greater than or equal to `2` and less than or equal to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 200000**
