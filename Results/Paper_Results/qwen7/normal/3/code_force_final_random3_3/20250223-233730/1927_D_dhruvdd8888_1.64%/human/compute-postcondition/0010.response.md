Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 200000, the first element of nums is not equal to num, and arr contains one element (1 + s, 0, num)**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, `n` is within the specified range, and the first element of `nums` is not equal to `num`. After executing the code, `i` remains unchanged as 0, `n` remains within its range, the condition about `nums` remains the same, and `arr` now contains the new tuple `(1 + s, 0, num)`.
