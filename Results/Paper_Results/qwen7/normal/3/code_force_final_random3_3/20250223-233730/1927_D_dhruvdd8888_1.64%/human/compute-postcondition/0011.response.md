Output State: **`i` is 0; `s` is 0; n must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 200000; the first element of nums is not equal to num; and arr contains one element (1 + s, 0, num)**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of `i`, which is initially 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` and `s` both become 0, while the other conditions and the array `arr` remain as they were in the initial state.
