Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is between 2 and 200000 inclusive, `s` is 2, `arr` contains two elements [(1, 1, 0), (2, 2, num)]**.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `i` will be 2, `n` will remain between 2 and 200000 inclusive, `s` will be 2, and `arr` will contain two specific elements as described.
