Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`.**

The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the resulting list in the variable `nums`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, and the queries remain unchanged.
