Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[-1]-1]`**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of list `a` by 1. Since `a[-1]` was previously the last element of `a` and it was used to append an element to `answer` as `answer.append(array[a[-1]])`, now `a[-1]` has been decremented by 1. Therefore, the new element appended to `answer` would be `array[a[-1]-1]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
