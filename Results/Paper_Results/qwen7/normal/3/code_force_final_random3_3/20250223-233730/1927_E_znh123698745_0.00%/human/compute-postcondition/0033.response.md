Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`. The variable `i` was initially set to 0 and is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` remains 0, while `n` and `k` are assigned the respective input integers.
