Output State: The loop will continue to append elements to `answer` based on the conditions provided until it has iterated `n-1` times. After all iterations, `answer` will contain `n-1` elements. 

If `(-1) ** i` equals -1, the element from `array` at index `a[-1] - 1` will be appended to `answer`, and `a[-1]` will be decremented by 1. Otherwise, the element from `array` at index `a[0]` will be appended to `answer`, and `a[0]` will be incremented by 1.

Since the loop runs `n-1` times, `a[-1]` will eventually reach -1 (if `(-1) ** i` equals -1 for all odd `i` up to `n-1`) or `a[0]` will reach `n` (if `(-1) ** i` equals 1 for all even `i` up to `n-1`). In either case, once `a[-1]` reaches -1 or `a[0]` reaches `n`, the loop will stop appending new elements to `answer`.

Therefore, `answer` will contain the first `n-1` elements of `array`, depending on whether `(-1) ** i` equals -1 or 1 for each iteration. If `(-1) ** i` equals -1 for more iterations, the elements from the end of `array` will be included; otherwise, the elements from the beginning of `array` will be included.
