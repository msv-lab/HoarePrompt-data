Output State: **`k` is the input value of `k` decremented by 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the numbers 1 and 2, `a` is a list containing [2, -1]**.

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the element at index `a[0]` (which is 2) of the list `array` to the list `answer`. Initially, `answer` contains `[1, -2]` or `[1, 1]` depending on the value of `array[-1]`. After appending, `answer` becomes `[1, 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
