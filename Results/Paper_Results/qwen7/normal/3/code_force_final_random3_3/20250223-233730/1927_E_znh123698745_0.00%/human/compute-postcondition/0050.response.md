Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[0]]`, `a[0]` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `a[0]` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 (implied initial value since it's not explicitly given but derived from the context) to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
