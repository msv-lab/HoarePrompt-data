Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `array` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `answer` has the element `array[a[-1]]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element at the index `a[-1]` of the list `array` to the list `answer`. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `array` and `a`, their states remain unchanged. The value of `i` and the condition for `n` also remain the same.
