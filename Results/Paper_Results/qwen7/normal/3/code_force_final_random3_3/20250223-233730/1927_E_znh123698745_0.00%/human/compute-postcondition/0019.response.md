Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `answer` contains the element at index 0 from `array`, and `array[0]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the value at index 0 of array `a` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `answer`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `array[0]` is now one more than its original value, while `i`, `n`, and `answer` retain their initial states.
