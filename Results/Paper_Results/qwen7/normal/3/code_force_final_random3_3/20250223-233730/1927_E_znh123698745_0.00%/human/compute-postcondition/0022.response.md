Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n)`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `(-1) ** i` equals -1, then `array` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, and `answer` has the element `array[a[-1] - 1]` appended to it.
   - Otherwise, `answer` contains the element at index 0 from `array`, and `array[0]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3 (because the loop increments `i` by 1 each time).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be updated to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 3

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
