Output State: The loop will have executed `n-1` times, so `i` will be equal to `n-1`. Since `n` is initially at least 2 and the loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`, `n` must be at least 3. 

If `(-1) ** i` equals -1 (which happens when `i` is odd), `answer` will append elements from `array` based on the value of `a[-1]` (decremented each time `(-1) ** i` is -1). If `(-1) ** i` equals 1 (which happens when `i` is even), `answer` will append elements from `array` based on the value of `a[0]` (incremented each time `(-1) ** i` is 1).

Given the pattern, `answer` will contain alternating elements from `array` starting with the element at index `a[0]` (increased or decreased as per the conditions) and the element at index `a[-1]` (decreased as per the conditions).

To summarize, `answer` will be a list containing every other element from `array`, starting from either `array[0]` or `array[a[-1]]`, depending on whether `n` is odd or even, with the indices adjusted according to the loop's conditions.
