Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a valid integer value. However, since the problem specifies that the input should be a positive integer within the given constraints, we need to ensure that the input meets these criteria.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the input from the user, we need to ensure that the input is within the specified range. The loop will continue to execute as long as the input is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself, ensuring it falls within the specified range.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
