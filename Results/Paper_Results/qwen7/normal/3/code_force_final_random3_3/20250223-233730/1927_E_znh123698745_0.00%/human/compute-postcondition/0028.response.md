Postcondition: `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3. If `(-1) ** i` equals -1, then `array` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1, and `answer` has a new element which is `array[a[-1]]`. Otherwise, `answer` contains the element at index 0 from `array`, and the element at index 0 of `array` is increased by 1.
