Output State: **`k` is the input value of `k` decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the number 1 and the element at index -1 of `a`, `a` is a list containing [1, -2], `i` is an integer such that the power of -1 on `i` equals -1.**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of list `a` by 1. Initially, `a` was `[1, -1]`. After executing the code, the last element `-1` is decremented by 1, making it `-2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
