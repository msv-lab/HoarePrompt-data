Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `array` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `answer` has a new element which is `array[a[-1]]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element from the `array` list at the index specified by `a[-1]` to the `answer` list. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `array` and `a`, their states remain unchanged. The only change is that `answer` now contains one additional element, which is the value at `array[a[-1]]`.
