Output State: **`k` is the input value of k decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to n, `answer` is a list containing the number 1 and the first element of `array`, `a` is a list containing [2, -1]**.

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the first element of the list `a` by 1. Initially, `a` was `[1, -1]`. After executing the code, the first element `a[0]` becomes `2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
