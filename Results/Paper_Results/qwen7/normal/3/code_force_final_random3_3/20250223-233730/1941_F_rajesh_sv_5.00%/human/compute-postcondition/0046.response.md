Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1, `l` is `mid + 1`, and `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to `mid + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value for `l`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
