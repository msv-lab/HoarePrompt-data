Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1 and `h` is not equal to `l`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, while the values of `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states.
