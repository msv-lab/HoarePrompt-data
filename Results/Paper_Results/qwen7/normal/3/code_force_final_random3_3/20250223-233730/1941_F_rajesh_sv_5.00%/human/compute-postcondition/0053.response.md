Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1 and `h` is not equal to `l`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `mid_sum` the value of `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` the value of `D[mid + 1] + f`. The values of `mid`, `h`, `D`, `f`, and `right` remain unchanged from their initial state.
