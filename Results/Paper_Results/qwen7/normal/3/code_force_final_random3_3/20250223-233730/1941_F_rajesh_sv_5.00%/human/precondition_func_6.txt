(n, m, k) are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 × 10^5; A is a list of n strictly increasing integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems; D is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models; F is a list of k integers representing the complexities of the functions; the values of A, D, and F are within specified ranges as described in the problem statement.
