Postcondition: `max_diff` is equal to the maximum difference encountered so far, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference encountered so far (or remains unchanged if no new second maximum was found), `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found (or remains `None` if `max_diff` did not change), `diff` is updated to `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`.
