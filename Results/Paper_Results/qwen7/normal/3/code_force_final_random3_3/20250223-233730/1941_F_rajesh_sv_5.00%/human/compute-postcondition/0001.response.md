State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head: The loop uses `testcases` as the range parameter, and `_` as the iterator variable. Since the iterator variable `_` is typically used when the value of the iterator itself is not needed, we focus on `testcases`.

2. Determine the condition for loop execution: The `range(testcases)` function will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `testcases-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `testcases` must be greater than 0.

3. Adjust the state: The initial state mentions that `testcases` is the result of calling `func_3()`. To ensure the loop executes, `testcases` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `testcases` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
