Output State: **`max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains `-inf`. `next_max_diff` is `-inf` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it is updated to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`. `index` is `i` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it remains `None`. `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `diff` as `A[i] - A[i - 1]`. This value of `diff` is then used to update `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` based on the conditions given. The values of `i`, `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged from their values in `func_4()`, and `i` is incremented by 1.
