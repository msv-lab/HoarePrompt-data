Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
- `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`
- The loop condition is `l < h`

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `l < h`.

### Loop Body:
The loop body updates either `l` or `h` based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`.

### Conditions for Updating `l` and `h`:
- If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
- Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
- `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`

### Determining the Next State:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition `l < h`.

#### Case 1: Update `l` to `mid + 1`
- If `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, then `l` becomes `mid + 1`.
- This means `l` is now `l + (h - l) // 2 + 1`.

#### Case 2: Update `h` to `mid`
- If `h` is updated to `mid`, then `h` becomes `mid`.
- This means `h` is now `l + (h - l) // 2`.

### Ensuring `l < h`:
- For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `h`.
- In both cases, the new values of `l` and `h` should still satisfy this condition.

### Adjusting the States:
Since the loop condition is `l < h`, we need to ensure that `l` and `h` are such that `l < h` holds true.

Given the current states:
- `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`
- We need to ensure that `l` and `h` are updated in a way that maintains `l < h`.

### Final Answer:
The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are the values of `l` and `h` such that `l < h` is maintained.

State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, and `l < h` must still hold true.**

This ensures that the loop can proceed to the next iteration.
