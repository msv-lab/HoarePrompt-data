Let's analyze the loop condition and the initial states step by step:

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while l < h:
```

### Initial States
- `l` is equal to `bisect_right(D, left - f)`
- `ans` holds the minimum value of `ans` updated during each iteration
- `f` is the next element in `F` (denoted as `f_next`)
- `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` reflect the sums `D[mid] + f_next` and `D[mid + 1] + f_next` for the last valid `mid` value
- `left` and `right` retain their values from the final iteration
- `h` is set to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`

### Analysis
To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to check the values of `l` and `h`.

1. **Initial Value of `l`:**
   - `l` is set to `bisect_right(D, left - f)`.
   - This means `l` is the index in the list `D` where `D[l]` is the smallest value such that `D[l] >= left - f`.

2. **Initial Value of `h`:**
   - `h` is set to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.
   - This means `h` is the index in the list `D` where `D[h+1]` is the smallest value such that `D[h+1] >= right - f`.

For the loop `while l < h` to execute at least once, `l` must be strictly less than `h`.

### Checking the Condition
- If `l == h`, the loop will not execute because the condition `l < h` will not be satisfied.
- Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` is strictly less than `h`.

### Adjusting the States
Given the initial states, the only way to ensure `l < h` is to make sure that the values of `l` and `h` are such that `l` is less than `h`.

Since the exact values of `l` and `h` depend on the specific values of `left`, `right`, and `f`, we cannot directly modify these values without additional information. However, we can ensure that the loop can potentially execute by stating that `l` must be less than `h`.

### Final Answer
State: **`l` must be less than `h`**
