Postcondition: **`max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains `-inf`. `next_max_diff` is now equal to `diff`. `index` remains `None`. `diff` is updated to `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`**.

This postcondition summarizes that if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `next_max_diff` is set to `diff`, and `index` remains `None`. Additionally, `diff` is updated to the difference between the current element and the previous element in array `A`, and the index `i` is incremented. All other variables (`A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F`) remain unchanged from their values in `func_4()`.
