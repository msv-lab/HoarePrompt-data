Output State: **`h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1, assuming `F` is a list and `D` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code calculates the index `h` using `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`. Here, `f` is assumed to be `f[0]` based on the initial state. The `bisect_left` function finds the leftmost occurrence of the value `right - f[0]` in the sorted list `D` and returns its index. Subtracting 1 from this index gives us `h`. The initial state's condition about `l` being the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]` remains unchanged, but now `h` is defined based on `right - f[0]` instead of `left - F[0]`.
