Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `i`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains `-inf`.
   - `next_max_diff` is `-inf` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it is updated to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`.
   - `index` is `i` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it remains `None`.
   - `A`, `diff`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(1, n)`, `i` will increase by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` will retain their current values unless they are updated in the loop body, but since no such updates are mentioned, they remain unchanged.
   - `A`, `diff`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains `-inf`. `next_max_diff` is `-inf` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it is updated to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`. `index` is `i` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it remains `None`. `A`, `diff`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
