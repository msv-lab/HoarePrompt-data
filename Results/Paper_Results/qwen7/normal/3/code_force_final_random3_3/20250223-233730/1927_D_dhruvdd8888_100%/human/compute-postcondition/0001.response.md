Output State: **t is a positive integer, N is an input integer, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.**

The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `N`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
