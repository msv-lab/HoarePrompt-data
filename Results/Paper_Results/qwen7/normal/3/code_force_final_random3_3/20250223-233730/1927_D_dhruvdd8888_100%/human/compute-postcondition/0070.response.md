Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `n` remains a positive integer inputted initially.
- `eli` is updated to the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.
- `l` is an input integer.
- `r` is an input integer.

The `print(-1, -1)` statement will print the literal values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
