Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head is:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
   ```
   The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop. It is typically used when the variable itself is not needed within the loop body.
   - `int(input())`: This is the condition that determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine Loop Execution Condition:**
   The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer. Since the loop is defined to run for the number of times specified by `int(input())`, the loop will continue until the input is no longer a positive integer.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The state before the loop starts is given as follows:
     - `t` is a positive integer.
     - `N` is an input integer.
     - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
     - `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer is in the range \([1, 10^6]\).
     - `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
     - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with an additional element `-1` appended to it.
     - `s` is \(N + 1\).
     - `e` is 0.
     - `num` is the value of `nums[N]`.
     - `arr` is a list containing up to \(N\) tuples, each of the form \((1 + i, i, num_i)\) where \(num_i\) is the value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the Input for the Loop:**
   - The loop will run based on the input provided by `int(input())`. Therefore, the state before the loop must ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer.

### Final State Adjustment:

Given the above analysis, the state before the loop must ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer. All other variables listed do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.

Thus, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`int(input())` must be a positive integer**
