Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies the positions where the elements in `nums` change.
2. For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the first change within the specified subarray.
3. The logic for determining the result based on the position of the change within the query range is correct.
4. The program handles edge cases such as when the subarray does not contain a change or when the subarray boundaries do not match the change positions.

Given the execution summary and the provided reasoning, the program appears to be functioning as intended based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
