Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `N` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with an additional element -1 appended to it, `s` is 2, `e` is 0, `num` is the value of `nums[i]`, `arr` is a list containing one tuple (3, i, num) if nums[i] is not equal to num, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. Given that `s` is 2 and `i` is 3, the tuple added to `arr` is `(3, 3, num)`. Since `num` is the value of `nums[i]`, and no other changes are made to the variables, the output state includes the updated `arr` list.
