Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is assigned the value of 1 or a value greater than `r`. Since `r` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know `s` is either 1 or greater than `r`.
- `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. Here, `LA` is not defined, so we need to consider `min(eli, LA)` as the minimum between `eli` and `LA`.
- `n` remains a positive integer inputted initially.
- `eli` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the list `arr`.

The print statement is `print(-1, -1)`. This statement will print the values `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **-1, -1**
