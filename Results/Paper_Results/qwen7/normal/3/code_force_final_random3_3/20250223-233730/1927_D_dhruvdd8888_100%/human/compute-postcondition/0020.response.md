Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(N + 1)`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < N + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Check the other variables**: The other variables (`N`, `a`, `q`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, `num`, and `arr`) are not part of the loop head and do not change based on the loop condition. They remain the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `N` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with an additional element -1 appended to it, `s` is 3, `e` is 0, `num` is the value of `nums[3]`, `arr` is a list containing one tuple (3, i, num) if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `i` is 4.**
