Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input by space, and the first integer is assigned to `l` and the second integer is assigned to `r`. The value of `n` remains as the positive integer inputted initially**.

This means that the initial positive integer input is no longer directly referenced, but its value is split into two integers, `l` and `r`. The original positive integer `n` is not updated or referenced further in the output state.
