Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `N` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with an additional element `-1` appended to it, `s` is 2, `e` is 0, `num` is the value of `nums[i]`, `arr` is a list containing one tuple `(1, i, num)` if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `i` is 2, `N` must be greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The line `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `num` is now specifically defined as `nums[i]`.
