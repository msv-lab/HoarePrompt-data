Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the same tuple.
   - `n` is a positive integer inputted initially.
   - `eli` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the list `arr`.
   - The current value of `s` is greater than `l` or `s` is not equal to 1 and `s` is less than or equal to `r`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(s - 1, s)
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `s` is the second element of a tuple at a specific index in `arr`. Given the conditions:
- `s` is greater than `l` or `s` is not equal to 1 and `s` is less than or equal to `r`.

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, and the tuple in `arr` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. However, we can describe it based on the conditions.

Given that `s` is the second element of a tuple and the conditions it must satisfy, let's denote the second element of the tuple as `s`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `s - 1`
- `s`

Output: **s - 1, s**
