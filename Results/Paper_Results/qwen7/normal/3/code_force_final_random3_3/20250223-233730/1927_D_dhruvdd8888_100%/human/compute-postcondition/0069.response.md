Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `n` remains a positive integer inputted initially.
   - `eli` is updated to the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.
   - `l` and `r` are input integers.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s, e + 1)
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the values of `s` and `e`:
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e` is the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

The `print(s, e + 1)` statement will print the value of `s` followed by the value of `e + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element and e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
