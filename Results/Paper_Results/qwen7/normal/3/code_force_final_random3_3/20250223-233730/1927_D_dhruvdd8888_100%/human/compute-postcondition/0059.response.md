Postcondition: `s` is assigned the value of 1 or a value greater than `r`, `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `n` remains a positive integer inputted initially, `eli` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of the tuple (l, 0, 0) in the list `arr`. If `s` is not equal to 1 and `s` is less than or equal to `r`, then `s` retains its original value which is greater than `l`. If `s` is less than or equal to `l`, `s` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the same tuple.
