You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6]; q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `N` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with an additional element -1 appended to it, `s` is `N + 1`, `e` is 0, `num` is the value of `nums[N]`, `arr` is a list containing up to `N` tuples, each of the form `(1 + i, i, num_i)` where `num_i` is the value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `i` ranges from 2 to `N`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `s` will be set to `N + 1` because the loop increments `s` on every iteration until it reaches `N`. The variable `num` will be the last element of `nums`, which is `nums[N]`. The list `arr` will contain all the positions where the elements in `nums` change, starting from index 2 up to `N`, capturing the transitions where `nums[i]` is different from `nums[i-1]`.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: All iterations of the loop have been executed. The variable `n` remains a positive integer as initially inputted. The variable `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` in `arr`, and `e` is the third element of the same tuple. The variable `eli` is the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`. The variables `l` and `r` are updated to the values of the integers inputted via `input().split()` and converted to integers using `map(int)` at each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list `a` of integers, along with positive integers `t`, `n`, and `q`, and a series of queries defined by pairs of integers `l` and `r`. For each query, it checks if the subarray from index `l` to `r-1` in list `a` meets a specific condition related to the value of `t`. The function returns the result of each query, which could be a boolean indicating whether the condition is met for each respective subarray.
