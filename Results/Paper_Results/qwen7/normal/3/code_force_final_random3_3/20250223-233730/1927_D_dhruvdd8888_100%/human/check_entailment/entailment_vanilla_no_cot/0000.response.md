Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Function `func_1` is incomplete**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called correctly within the main loop. The code reads the test cases and calls `func_1` once at the beginning, but `func_1` should be called for each test case.

2. **Incorrect handling of queries**: The logic inside `func_1` for processing queries is flawed. Specifically, the binary search (`bisect_left`) is used incorrectly to find the relevant segment in the `arr`. The conditions for determining `i` and `j` are not correctly implemented.

3. **Edge cases not handled properly**: There are edge cases where the program might fail to produce the correct output. For example, when `s > l` and `e < r`, the current logic does not handle these cases correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import log, log2, pow, gcd, ceil, floor
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *

def process_test_case():
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    segments = []
    for i in range(N):
        if nums[i] != nums[s]:
            segments.append((s, i))
            s = i
    segments.append((s, N))  # Add the last segment
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (l, r) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        left_index = bisect_left(segments, (l, float('inf')))
        if left_index == 0:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            (s, e) = segments[left_index - 1]
            if s <= l and l <= e and e < r:
                print(l, e + 1)
            else:
                print(-1, -1)

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    process_test_case()
    print()  # Print an empty line between test cases
```

This corrected version processes each test case separately and handles the queries correctly by finding the appropriate segment and checking if there are distinct elements within the query range.
