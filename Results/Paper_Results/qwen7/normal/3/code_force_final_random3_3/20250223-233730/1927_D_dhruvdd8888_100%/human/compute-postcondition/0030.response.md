Output State: **`l` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `n` is a positive integer inputted initially, `eli` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of the tuple (l, 0, 0) in the list `arr`.**

The code `eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` searches for the leftmost occurrence of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the list `arr` and assigns the index of this tuple to the variable `eli`. Since the initial values of `l`, `r`, and `n` are unchanged, they remain as integers from the input and the positive integer inputted initially, respectively.
