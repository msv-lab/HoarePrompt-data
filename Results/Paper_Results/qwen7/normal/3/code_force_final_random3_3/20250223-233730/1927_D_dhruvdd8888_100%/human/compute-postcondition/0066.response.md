Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `n` remains a positive integer inputted initially.
   - `eli` is updated to the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `r` is an input integer.
   - `s` remains 1 or a value greater than `r`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(s - 1, s)
   ```

Given the conditions:
- `s` is either 1 or a value greater than `r`.
- Since `s` remains 1 or a value greater than `r`, and it is explicitly stated that `s` remains 1 or a value greater than `r`, we can infer that `s` is either 1 or a value greater than `r`.

Since `s` is either 1 or a value greater than `r`, let's consider both cases:
- If `s` is 1, then `s - 1` would be 0.
- If `s` is a value greater than `r`, then `s - 1` would be a value greater than `r - 1`.

However, since `s` is explicitly stated to remain 1 or a value greater than `r`, and no specific value for `r` is provided, we can only definitively say that `s` is 1 or a value greater than `r`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **0, 1** if `s` is 1, or **a value greater than r-1, s** if `s` is a value greater than `r`.

Given the explicit condition that `s` remains 1 or a value greater than `r`, the most precise and definitive answer is:
Output: **0, 1**
