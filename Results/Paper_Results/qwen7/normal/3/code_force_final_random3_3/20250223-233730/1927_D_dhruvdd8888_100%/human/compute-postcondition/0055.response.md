Postcondition: `s` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the same tuple, `n` remains a positive integer inputted initially, and `s` is less than or equal to `l`, and `e` is less than `r`. Additionally, if `e` is less than `N` or `e` is less than `l`, then `e` is less than `N`. Otherwise, `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.
