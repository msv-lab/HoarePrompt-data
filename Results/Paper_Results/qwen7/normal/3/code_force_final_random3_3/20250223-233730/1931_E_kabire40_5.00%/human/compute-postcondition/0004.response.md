Output State: **`rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input.**

Explanation: The code `operational_list = input().split()` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `operational_list`. The other variables (`rev_val`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, and `max_power`) remain unchanged.
