Output State: **`rev_val` is a non-empty list, `rev_res` is a string concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`, `x` is incremented by 1, `val_in` is an integer extracted from `rev_val` at index `x`.**

This means that the `rev_res` string now includes the string representation of the `val_in` integer that was extracted from the `rev_val` list at the index specified by `x`, which has been incremented by 1 after the operation. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
