Output State: **`len(rev_val)` must be greater than 0; `x` is 1; `val_in` is `rev_val[1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `rev_val[x]` to `val_in`. Given that `x` is 1, `val_in` is set to the second element of `rev_val` (considering the index starts from 0). The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
