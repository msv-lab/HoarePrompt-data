Postcondition: `rev_val` is a non-empty list, `rev_res` is a string. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is obtained by converting `rev_val[x]` to an integer. Otherwise, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` plus the reverse of the element from `rev_val` at index `x`, and `x` is incremented by 1.
