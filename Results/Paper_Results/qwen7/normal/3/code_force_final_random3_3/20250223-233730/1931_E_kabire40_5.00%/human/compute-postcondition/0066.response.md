Output State: **`x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`, and the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`; `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`. The variable `x_rev` remains unchanged as it was the integer representation of the reverse of `x` before the code execution. The length condition for `x_rev` also remains valid.
