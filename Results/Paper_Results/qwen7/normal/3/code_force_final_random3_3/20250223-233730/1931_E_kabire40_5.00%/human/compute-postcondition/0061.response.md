Output State: **`x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` and converts it back to an integer. The original value of `x` is reversed and stored in `x_rev`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
