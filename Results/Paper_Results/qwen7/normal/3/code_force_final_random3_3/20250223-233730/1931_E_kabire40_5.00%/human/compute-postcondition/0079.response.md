Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `x` will be the last element in `operational_list`. `x_rev` will be the integer representation of the reverse of `x`. If the length of `x` is equal to the length of `x_rev`, `rev_res` will contain all such `x` elements from `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_res` will be an empty string. `rev_val` will be a list containing the reverse of `x` if the lengths of `x` and `x_rev` are not equal, and it will remain an empty list otherwise.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `x` will hold the final element processed from `operational_list`. The variable `x_rev` will store the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. Depending on whether the original string and its reversed version have the same length, `rev_res` will either accumulate all such matching strings or remain an empty string. Similarly, `rev_val` will either contain the reversed form of `x` (if their lengths differ) or remain an empty list.
