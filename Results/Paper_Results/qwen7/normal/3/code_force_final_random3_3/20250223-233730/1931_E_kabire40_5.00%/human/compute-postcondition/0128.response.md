Output State: **`x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`, `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `rev_res` is `x_rev`, and `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` adds the value of `x` (which is `x_rev` from the initial state) to `rev_res`. Since `rev_res` was initially 0, after adding `x_rev`, `rev_res` becomes `x_rev`. The other variables (`x` and `rev_val`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
