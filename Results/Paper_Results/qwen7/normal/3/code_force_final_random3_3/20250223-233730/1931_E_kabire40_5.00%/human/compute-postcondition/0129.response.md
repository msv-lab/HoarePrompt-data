Output State: **`x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`, `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `rev_res` is 0, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`. Since `x[::-1]` reverses the string `x`, `rev_val` now contains this reversed string. The other variables (`x_rev`, `x`, and `rev_res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
