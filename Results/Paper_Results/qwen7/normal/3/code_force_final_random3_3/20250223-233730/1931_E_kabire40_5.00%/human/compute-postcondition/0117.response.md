Output State: **`x` is an integer equal to 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `max_power` is less than or equal to 0, `list_len` is the first input value converted to an integer, `max_power` is the second input value converted to an integer, `operational_list` is a list created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `operational_list = input().split()` takes user input and splits it into a list based on spaces. The values of `x`, `rev_val`, `rev_res`, `max_power`, `list_len`, and the original values of `max_power` remain unchanged. The new variable `operational_list` is created and populated with the split input.
