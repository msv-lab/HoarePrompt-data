Postcondition: **The final value of `rev_res` is constructed by iterating through `rev_val`. For each index `x` in `rev_val`:
- If `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]`.
- If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is updated by appending the reverse of the string value of `rev_val[x]`.
After all iterations, regardless of whether \(10^{int(max_power)}\) is less than the integer value represented by `rev_res` or not, `rev_res` contains a concatenated string formed according to these rules.**
