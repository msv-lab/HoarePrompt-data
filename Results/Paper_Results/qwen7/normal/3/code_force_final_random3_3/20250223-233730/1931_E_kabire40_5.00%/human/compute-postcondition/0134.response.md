Output State: **`x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`; `rev_res` is `rev_res` + `x`.**

The code updates `rev_res` by adding the value of `x` to it. However, since the initial value of `rev_res` is not specified, we only know that `rev_res` is now `rev_res` plus `x`. The value of `x_rev` remains unchanged.
