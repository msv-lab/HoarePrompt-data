Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `rev_val` is a list, `rev_res` is a string. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` with the additional character `val_in` appended, where `val_in` is an integer equal to `rev_val[x]`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` concatenated with the reversed value of `val_in`.
