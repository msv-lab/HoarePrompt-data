Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` and the object `operational_list`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `y` is `k + 1`.
   - `rev_val` is an empty list.
   - `rev_res` is an empty string.
   - `list_len` is an input string.
   - `max_power` is an input string.
   - `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `operational_list`. For the loop to execute, `operational_list` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `operational_list`, we need to ensure that `operational_list` is not empty.
   - The other variables (`y`, `rev_val`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, `max_power`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `operational_list` must contain at least one element.

**State:**
**`y` is `k + 1`, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a non-empty list of strings**
