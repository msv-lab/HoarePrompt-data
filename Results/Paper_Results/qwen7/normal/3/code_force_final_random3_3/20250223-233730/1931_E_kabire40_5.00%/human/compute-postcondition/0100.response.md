Output State: **`x` is an integer (x + 1), `rev_val` is a list, `rev_res` is a string, `val_in` is the element at index `x` in `rev_val`**.

This means that the variable `val_in` is now holding the value of the element at index `x` in the list `rev_val`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
