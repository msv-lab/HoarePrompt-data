Output State: **`x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` is empty, `rev_val` is an empty list, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`**.

Explanation: The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` takes the string `x`, reverses it using slicing (`x[::-1]`), and then converts the reversed string into an integer using `int()`. The other variables remain unchanged.
