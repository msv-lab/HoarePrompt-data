Output State: **`x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` contains `x`, `rev_val` is an empty list, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`**.

Explanation: The line `rev_res = rev_res + x` appends the value of `x` to the list `rev_res`. Since `rev_res` was initially empty, after this operation, `rev_res` now contains the single element `x`. The other variables (`x_rev`, `rev_val`, and `operational_list`) remain unchanged.
