Postcondition: `rev_val` is a non-empty list, `rev_res` is a string. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` concatenated with the string representation of the integer obtained from converting `rev_val[x]` to an integer. Otherwise, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` plus the reverse of the element from `rev_val` at index `x`. In both cases, `x` is incremented by 1.
