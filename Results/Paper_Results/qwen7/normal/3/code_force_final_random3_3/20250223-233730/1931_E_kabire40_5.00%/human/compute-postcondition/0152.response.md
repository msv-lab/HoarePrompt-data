Output State: **`rev_val` is a non-empty list, `rev_res` is a string, `x` is incremented by 1, `val_in` is the element at index `x` in `rev_val`.**

In this step, the code assigns the value at index `x` of the list `rev_val` to the variable `val_in`. The other variables remain unchanged, and `x` is incremented by 1.
