Postcondition: `rev_res` is a string constructed by iterating through `rev_val`. For each index `x` in `rev_val`:
- If `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]`.
- If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is updated by appending the reverse of the string value of `rev_val[x]`.
Additionally, the value of `10 ** int(max_power)` is greater than or equal to `int(rev_res)`.
