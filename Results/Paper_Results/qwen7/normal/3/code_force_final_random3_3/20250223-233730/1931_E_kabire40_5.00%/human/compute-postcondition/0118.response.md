Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in operational_list:`. The objects involved here are `x` and `operational_list`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` is an integer equal to 0.
   - `operational_list` is a list created from the input split by spaces.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `operational_list`. For the loop to start executing, `operational_list` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is initialized to 0 and will be assigned values from `operational_list`, we don't need to adjust its initial value.
   - We need to ensure that `operational_list` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `operational_list` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is an integer equal to 0, operational_list is a list created from the input split by spaces that must contain at least one element**
