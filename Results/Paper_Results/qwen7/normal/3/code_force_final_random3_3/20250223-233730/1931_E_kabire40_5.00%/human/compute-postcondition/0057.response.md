Output State: **`y` is k + 1; `rev_val` is an empty list; `rev_res` is an empty string**

Explanation: The line `rev_res = ''` initializes the variable `rev_res` as an empty string. This does not affect the values of `y` or `rev_val`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `y` and `rev_val`, while adding that `rev_res` is now an empty string.
