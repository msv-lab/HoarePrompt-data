The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers (list length and maximum power) and a list of integers. It reverses each integer in the list, sorts the reversed integers, and then constructs a new string by concatenating every even-indexed reversed integer and the reverse of every odd-indexed reversed integer. Finally, it compares this constructed string (interpreted as an integer) with \(10^{max\_power}\), printing 'Sasha' if the constructed string is greater, and 'Anna' otherwise. This process is repeated for each test case.
