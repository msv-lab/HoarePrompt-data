Output State: **`x` is 0, `x_rev` is 0**

Explanation: The initial value of `x` is 0, which is an integer. The line `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` attempts to reverse the string representation of `x` and convert it back to an integer. Since `x` is '0', reversing it still results in '0', and converting '0' back to an integer results in 0. Therefore, `x_rev` is assigned the value 0. The value of `x` remains unchanged.
