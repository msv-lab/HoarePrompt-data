Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `power` is set to 5 if `n == 15`, otherwise `power` is 4 if `n != 15` and `n >= 16`, or `power` is at least 3 and does not equal `n` if `n < 16`.**

This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the variable `i` will be 2 (since the loop iterates up to `n_cases - 1`), `t` will still be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (as it was not modified by the loop), and `n_cases` will be greater than 2 (since the loop runs at least twice). The value of `power` depends on the last value of `n` processed in the loop, following the conditions specified in the loop's logic.
