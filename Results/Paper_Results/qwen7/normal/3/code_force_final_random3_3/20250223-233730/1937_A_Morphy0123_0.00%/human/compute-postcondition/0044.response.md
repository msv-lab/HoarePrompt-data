Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n_cases`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n_cases`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n_cases` is the input integer
   - `i` is either 1 or 2
   - `n` is the integer entered by the user
   - `power` is set to 5 if `n == 15` and `power == 15`, or `power` is set to 4 otherwise.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is either 1 or 2, after the previous iteration, `i` would be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 or 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n_cases`. Hence, `i` should be 2 and `n_cases` must be greater than 2.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer entered by the user, and `power` is set to 5 if `n == 15` and `power == 15`, or `power` is set to 4 otherwise.**
