Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 16.
- `power` is greater than or equal to 3 and is not equal to `n`.

The `print(2 ** power)` statement will print \(2\) raised to the power of `power`.

Since `power` is specified to be greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to `n`, we know `power` must be an integer with a minimum value of 3. However, the exact value of `power` is not specified, so we cannot determine a specific numerical result.

Thus, the output will be:

Output: **2 ** power (where power is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to n)**
