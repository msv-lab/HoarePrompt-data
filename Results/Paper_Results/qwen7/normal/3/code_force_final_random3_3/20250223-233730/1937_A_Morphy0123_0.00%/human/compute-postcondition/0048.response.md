Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while power < log2(n):`. The variables involved here are `power` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `power` is currently 1.
   - `n` is an integer entered by the user.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `power < log2(n)`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `log2(n)` must be greater than `power`, which is currently 1.

4. **Adjust the state of `n`**:
   - Since `power` is 1, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.
   - This means `n` must be greater than \(2^1 = 2\).

5. **Consider the given constraints**:
   - `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2 (this does not affect the loop condition).
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (this does not affect the loop condition).

Given these considerations, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure `log2(n) > 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1**
