Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `power`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`. For the loop to execute at least once, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.

3. **Determine the current state of the variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` is the input integer (its value is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `i` is either 1 or 2 (its value is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n` is the integer entered by the user (its value is not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `power` is 1.

4. **Check if the loop can execute with the current state**:
   - Since `power` is currently 1, the loop will execute as long as `log2(n)` is greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. This means `n` must be greater than \(2^1 = 2\).

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1**
