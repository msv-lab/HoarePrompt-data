Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is an integer greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 16.
- `power` is 4, and it also equals `n`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(2 ** power)`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `power` is explicitly given as 4.
- Therefore, the expression `2 ** power` evaluates to `2 ** 4`.

Calculating `2 ** 4` gives us 16.

Thus, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **16**
