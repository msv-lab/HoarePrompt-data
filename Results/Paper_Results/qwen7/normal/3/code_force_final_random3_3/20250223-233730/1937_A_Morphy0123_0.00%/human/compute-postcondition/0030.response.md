Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`.
2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `power` and `n`.
3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `power` is currently set to 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < log2(n)` must be true. Given that `power` is currently 2, the loop will continue as long as `log2(n) > 2`.

4. **Calculate the minimum value of `n` for the loop to continue**:
   - We need `log2(n) > 2`.
   - This implies \( n > 2^2 \).
   - Therefore, \( n > 4 \).

So, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 4.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `power` remains 2 (no change needed).
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 4.

Thus, the state at the end of the previous iteration, adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` must be greater than 4, `power` is 2**
