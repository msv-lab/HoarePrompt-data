Output State: **`power` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `power` to 1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n_cases`, `i`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
