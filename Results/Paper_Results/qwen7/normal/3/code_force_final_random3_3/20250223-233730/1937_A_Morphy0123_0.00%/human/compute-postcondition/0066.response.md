Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes two integers, t and n, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. It returns information based on the values of t and n.**

However, since the function definition itself does not specify what exactly it returns based on t and n, the description would need more detail about the specific logic applied to t and n. Given the constraints, it could be inferring something like test cases or some form of processing based on these parameters, but without further specification, we can only state that it processes these two integers within the given ranges.
