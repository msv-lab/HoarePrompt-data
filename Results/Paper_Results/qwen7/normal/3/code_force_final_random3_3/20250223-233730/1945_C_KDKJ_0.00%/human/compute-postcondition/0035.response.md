Output State: **`i` is 0; `left` is `S[0][0]`; `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`. The condition `(left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum)` is true.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the statement itself, the values of `i`, `left`, `lsum`, `rsum`, and the condition remain unchanged.
