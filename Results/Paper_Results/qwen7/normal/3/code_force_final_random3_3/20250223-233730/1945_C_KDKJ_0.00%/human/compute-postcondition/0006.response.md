Output State: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 300000, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `func_1()` has been called three times.

Explanation: The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`. After the first three executions of the loop, the input value for the loop has been decremented by 3. Therefore, the loop will continue to run until the input value becomes zero or negative. However, since the initial condition is that `3 ≤ n ≤ 300000`, and the decrement happens by exactly one each time the loop runs, the loop will run exactly `int(input())` times. After all iterations, `func_1()` will have been called `int(input())` times, and `int(input())` will be reduced to 0. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
