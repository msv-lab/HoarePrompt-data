Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `satisfy` is 0, `ans` is 0, `a` is an empty string, `S` is a list containing all intermediate states of `[x, y]` for each iteration of the loop, where `x` is incremented by 1 if the current character is '0', and `y` is incremented by 1 if the current character is '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - lsum
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`. If the condition `(left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum)` is true, then the function does nothing. Otherwise, `i` is assigned to `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1]) - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, then no changes occur. Otherwise, `ans` is 1, and if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`, then `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1 as well.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1] + S[1][0] + S[1][1] + S[2][0] + S[2][1])`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the function does nothing. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is set to 2 if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
