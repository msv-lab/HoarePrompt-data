### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves determining the optimal position `i` to place a road that divides the village into two parts such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - The satisfaction condition is met if the number of residents wanting to live on the left side is at least `⌈left/2⌉` and on the right side is at least `⌈right/2⌉`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function processes the input string `a` and calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position.
   - It then checks for each position `i` whether placing the road after `i` satisfies the conditions.
   - If the conditions are met, it updates the answer `ans` to be the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference `|n/2 - i|`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it calls `func_1`.

4. **Execution States:**
   - The code correctly initializes and processes the input string `a` to compute the cumulative counts.
   - It iterates through each position `i` to check the conditions and update the answer accordingly.
   - The logic for updating the answer ensures that the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference `|n/2 - i|` is chosen.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the road is placed before the first house (`ans = 0`).
   - It correctly handles the case where the road is placed after the last house (`ans = n-1`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position `i` for placing the road. The code accurately processes the input, computes the necessary cumulative counts, and updates the answer based on the given conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
