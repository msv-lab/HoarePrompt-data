Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1'. If the last character of `a` (denoted as `s`) is '0', then the last character of `a` (denoted as `x`) is incremented by 1. If the first character of `a` is '1', then the last character of `a` (denoted as `y`) is incremented by 1.
