Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 300000, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `func_1()` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no details about what `func_1()` does are provided, we cannot specify changes to the variables. The precondition remains the same, and `func_1()` is simply invoked.
