Output State: **`i` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1]) - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `right` to `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. Given that `i` is 2, the new value of `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
