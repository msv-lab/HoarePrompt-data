Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1', but one character shorter than before; `S` is a list containing two lists `[x, y]` and `[x+1, y+1]`; `x` is the last character of the new `a` plus 1 if the last character of the new `a` is '0', and `y` is the last character of the new `a` plus 1 if the first character of the new `a` is '1'; `y` is increased by 1.**

This means that the variable `y` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
