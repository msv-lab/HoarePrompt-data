Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1', but one character shorter than before; `S` is a list containing a single list `[x+1, y]` where `x` is the last character of the new `a` plus 1 if the last character of the new `a` is '0', and `y` is the last character of the new `a` plus 1 if the first character of the new `a` is '1'; `x` is the last character of the new `a` plus 1 if the last character of the new `a` is '0', and `y` is the last character of the new `a` plus 1 if the first character of the new `a` is '1'; `y` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
