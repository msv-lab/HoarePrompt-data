Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an optimal position `i` for the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the road are satisfied.
2. The solution involves calculating the number of '0's (left side) and '1's (right side) up to each position `i` and checking if the conditions are met.
3. Function `func_1` correctly implements this logic:
   - It iterates through the binary string `a` and keeps track of the count of '0's and '1's.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if the counts of '0's and '1's up to `i` and beyond `i` meet the required conditions.
   - It updates the answer `ans` if the current position meets the conditions and is closer to `n/2` than the previous best position.
4. Function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1` the number of times specified by the input.
5. Both functions together correctly solve the problem as described.

Given the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
