Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 300000\).
   - `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.
   - `func_1()` has been called.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0. After each iteration, the value of `int(input())` is reduced by 1 (since it is decremented in each iteration).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is driven by `int(input())`, we need to decrement this value by 1.
   - The value of `n` and `a` remains unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
   - `func_1()` has already been called, so no further action is needed for it.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `int(input())` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `func_1()` has already been called.

If we denote the value of `int(input())` at the end of the previous iteration as `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `int(input())` will be `k-1`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can represent it as a general form.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 300000\), `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1 from its previous value)**.
