Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1]) - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, then no changes occur. Otherwise, `ans` is 1, and if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`, then `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1 as well.**
