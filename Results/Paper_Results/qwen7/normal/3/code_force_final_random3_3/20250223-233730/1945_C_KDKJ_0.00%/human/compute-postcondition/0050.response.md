Output State: **`i` is 1, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1]) - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The line `ans = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `ans`. All other variables (`left`, `lsum`, `rsum`, and `right`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
