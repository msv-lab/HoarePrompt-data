The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) (the number of test cases), followed by an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It then checks if the array \( a \) is beautiful (i.e., all elements in the array are the same). If the array is beautiful, it prints -1. Otherwise, it finds the minimum count of consecutive identical elements in the array and prints this minimum count.
