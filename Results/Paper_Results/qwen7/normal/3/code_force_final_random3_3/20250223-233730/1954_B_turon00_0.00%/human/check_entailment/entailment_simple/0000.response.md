Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and creates a set `aa` from the array to check if all elements are the same.
4. If the set `aa` has only one unique element, it prints `-1` because the array is already non-beautiful.
5. It then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same as `tmp`. This is done using a counter `cnt` which increments when the current element matches `tmp` and resets when it doesn't.
6. The minimum value of `cnt` found during the iteration is stored in `ans`.
7. Finally, it prints `ans`, which represents the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the logic in the program seems to correctly implement the solution. The program handles all edge cases, such as when the array is already non-beautiful (`len(aa) == 1`) and when the array needs to be modified to stop being beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
