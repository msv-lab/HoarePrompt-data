Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case individually.
2. It checks if the array is already beautiful by verifying if all elements are the same. If they are, it prints -1, which is correct according to the problem statement.
3. If the array is not beautiful, the program aims to find the minimum count of consecutive identical elements. However, the logic used to find this minimum count is flawed.
   - The program iterates through the array and counts consecutive identical elements. When a different element is encountered, it updates the answer with the minimum count found so far.
   - This approach only considers sequences of consecutive identical elements and does not account for the possibility of removing elements to break the beauty condition across non-consecutive elements.
4. The program fails to consider scenarios where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing fewer elements than the minimum count of consecutive identical elements found.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is False.

Correctness: **False**
