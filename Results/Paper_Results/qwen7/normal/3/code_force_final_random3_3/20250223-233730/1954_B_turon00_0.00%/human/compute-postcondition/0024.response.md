Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is the minimum of its previous value and `ans`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to be the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is incremented by 1 only if `a[1]` equals `tmp`, the value of `cnt` remains unchanged from its previous value unless that condition is met. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this line of code.
