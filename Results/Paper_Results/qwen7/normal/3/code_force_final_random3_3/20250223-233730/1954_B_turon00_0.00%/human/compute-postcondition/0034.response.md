Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `cnt` will be 0, `ans` will be the minimum value between the initial value of `n` and the cumulative counts of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` observed throughout the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The index variable `i` will have reached the length of the list `a`, which is `n`.
- The variable `cnt` will reset to 0 because it is reset to 0 whenever `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`.
- The variable `ans` will hold the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found in the list `a`. If no such sequence exists, `ans` will be equal to the initial value of `n`.
