Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` has some value, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `i`, `n`, `tmp`, and `a` were not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. The only change is that `cnt` is now one more than its previous value.
