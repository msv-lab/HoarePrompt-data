### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) when \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if all elements in the array are the same using a set (`aa`). If they are, it prints `-1` because the array cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to track unique elements.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive occurrences of the same element (`cnt`).
   - It updates the answer (`ans`) with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum count of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - The logic for checking if the array is already uniform (all elements the same) is correct.
   - The counting of consecutive occurrences and updating the answer seems to follow the requirement of making the array non-beautiful.
   - The solution correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already uniform, the solution correctly outputs `-1`.
   - The solution correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the logic, there are some issues with the implementation:

- **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Occurrences**: The current logic only counts consecutive occurrences of the first element (`tmp`). This does not account for other potential sequences within the array that could also make it non-beautiful.
- **Set Usage**: Using a set (`aa`) to track unique elements is unnecessary and does not help in identifying the minimum number of elements to remove.
- **Logic for Updating `ans`**: The logic for updating `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences is flawed. It only considers the first element and does not account for other sequences that might need to be broken.

### Detailed Evaluation:

1. **Initial Check for Uniformity**: The check for uniformity using a set is correct.
2. **Counting Consecutive Occurrences**: The current logic only counts consecutive occurrences of the first element, which is insufficient. We need to consider all possible sequences that could make the array non-beautiful.
3. **Updating `ans`**: The logic for updating `ans` should consider all possible sequences of consecutive elements, not just the first element.

### Corrected Logic:

To correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove, we need to:
- Identify all sequences of consecutive elements.
- Track the length of these sequences.
- Update `ans` with the minimum length of any sequence that can be broken to make the array non-beautiful.

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the detailed analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate due to the flawed logic for counting and updating the minimum number of elements to remove. The corrected logic would involve a more comprehensive approach to identify and count all sequences of consecutive elements.

**Final: False**
