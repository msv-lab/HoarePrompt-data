Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1, `i` is less than `n`, `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `i` is still less than `n`, `a[i]` is still equal to `tmp`, and `cnt` has been increased by 1.
