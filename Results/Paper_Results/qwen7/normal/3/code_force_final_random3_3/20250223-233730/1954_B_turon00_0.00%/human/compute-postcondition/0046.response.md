Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is `t-1`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`, `ans` is `n`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `cnt`, `i`, `t`, `a`, `tmp`, and `aa` remain unchanged.
