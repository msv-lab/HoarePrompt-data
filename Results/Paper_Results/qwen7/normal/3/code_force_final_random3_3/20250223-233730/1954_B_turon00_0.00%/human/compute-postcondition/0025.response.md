Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` sets the value of `cnt` to 0. Since `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is now 0, `ans` will also be 0 (assuming `ans` was greater than or equal to 0 before this line). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
