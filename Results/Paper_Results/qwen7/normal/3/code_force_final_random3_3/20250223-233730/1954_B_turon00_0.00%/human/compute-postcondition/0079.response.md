Output State: **`ans` is `n`, `i` equals `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `t` is `t - 1` which is greater than 0, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans = n` simply assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `a`, `tmp`, `t`, `aa`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
