Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `results`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `result`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `idx` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `results` is a list with `t-1` elements.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `results`.
   - Since `results` currently has `t-1` elements, the next element (if it exists) would be the `t`-th element.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `result` will be set to the next element in `results`, which is the `t`-th element.
   - `results` will have `t-2` elements after this iteration because the current element (the `t`-th element) is being processed.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `results` is a list with `t-2` elements, and `result` is the `t`-th element in the original list**.
