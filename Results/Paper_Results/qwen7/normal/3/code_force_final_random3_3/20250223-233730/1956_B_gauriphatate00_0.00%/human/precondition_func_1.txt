t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, representing the number of cards you and Nene receive initially. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the integers on the cards in your hand, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list at most 2 times.
