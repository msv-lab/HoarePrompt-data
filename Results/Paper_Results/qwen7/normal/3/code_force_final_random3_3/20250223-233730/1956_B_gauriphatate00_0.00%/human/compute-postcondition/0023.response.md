Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-2*n:idx-n]` converted using `map(int, ...)`, `results` is a list with an element `func_1(n, a)` appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, a)` to the `results` list. The values of `data`, `idx`, and `a` are updated according to the given conditions, but no specific values are provided for these variables, so they remain as described in the initial state. The `results` list now contains one additional element, which is the result of `func_1(n, a)`.
