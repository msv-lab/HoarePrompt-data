Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game dynamics as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for Nene's optimal strategy to minimize the player's score. Instead, it simply returns the minimum of the number of pairs of cards and half the number of cards the player has. This approach does not consider Nene's strategic selection of cards to maximize her score while minimizing the player's score.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

However, the current implementation would output:
```
2
```

This is because the function incorrectly calculates the maximum points the player can get without considering Nene's optimal strategy. For this specific case, the correct output should be 1, as explained in the example note. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
