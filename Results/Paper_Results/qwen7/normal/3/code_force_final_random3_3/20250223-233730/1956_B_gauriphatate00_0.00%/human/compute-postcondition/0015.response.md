Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]` converted using `map(int, ...)`, `results` is a list with two additional elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, a)` for the current and previous iterations.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `a` by converting a slice of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n` into a list of integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variable `idx` is incremented by 1. The value of `data` remains unchanged, and `results` is updated with the return values of `func_1(n, a)` for the current and previous iterations.
