### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene, who plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - Nene will always place cards on the table to block your points whenever possible.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of pairs of identical cards in your hand using `Counter`.
   - It returns the minimum of the number of such pairs and half the number of your cards (`n // 2`).
   - This logic is based on the fact that Nene will always try to block your points by placing cards on the table when possible.
   - However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for the optimal strategy of Nene. Nene will not just block your points but will also try to maximize her own points while minimizing yours. Therefore, simply counting pairs and returning the minimum of pairs and `n // 2` is not sufficient.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles reading multiple test cases and splitting the input data.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` and prints the result.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal strategy of Nene. Nene will not just block your points but will also try to maximize her own points.
   - The implementation in `func_2` is correct. It reads the input properly, processes each test case, and prints the results.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program does not correctly determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. The function `func_1` does not account for Nene's optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate because `func_1` does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
