Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `_` (a dummy variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is initially set to `int(data[0])`.
   - The value of `idx` is 2.
   - `results` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.
   - The values of `idx` and `results` do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` must be greater than 0.

**State:**
**`data` is a list containing strings split from the input, t must be greater than 0, idx is 2, results is an empty list**
