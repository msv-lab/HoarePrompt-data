Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n:idx]` converted using `map(int, ...)`**, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)` for the next iteration, `n` is an integer from `data[idx]`.

Explanation: The code updates the list `a` by converting the elements from `data[idx:idx + n]` into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `idx` is incremented by 1, `a` now contains integers from the specified slice of `data`, and `n` remains as an integer from `data[idx]`.
