Output State: `data` remains unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 3 * n`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-3*n:idx-2*n]` converted using `map(int, ...)`, `results` is a list with elements from each iteration of `func_1(n, a)` appended, totaling `t` elements.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The `data` list remains unchanged throughout the process.
- The `idx` variable will have increased by `3 * n` (since it increments by `n` each iteration and the loop runs `t` times).
- The `a` list contains integers from the portion of `data` that corresponds to the last iteration's input.
- The `results` list contains the outputs of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, resulting in a total of `t` elements in the `results` list.
