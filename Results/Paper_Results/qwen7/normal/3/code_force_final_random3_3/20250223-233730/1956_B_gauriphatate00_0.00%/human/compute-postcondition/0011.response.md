Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, a)` to the `results` list. The value of `idx` is updated to `idx + n + 1`. The list `a` is sliced from `data` starting at index `idx - n - 1` to `idx - 1`. All other variables remain in their initial state except for the addition of the new element to `results`.
