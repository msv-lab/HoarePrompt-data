### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n, a)` is designed to calculate the maximum number of points you can get in the game.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs (integers that appear exactly twice) and returns the minimum value between this count and `n // 2`.
   - This logic is correct because:
     - If there are more than `n // 2` pairs, Nene can always pair them up, leaving you with no points.
     - If there are fewer or equal to `n // 2` pairs, you can strategically place your cards to ensure you get at least `n // 2` points.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, the number of cards `n`, and the list of integers `a` for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a)` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
   - The function does not modify the input data and only uses the input data to compute and print the results.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program is to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and computes the result for each test case using the logic implemented in `func_1(n, a)`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get in the game for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
