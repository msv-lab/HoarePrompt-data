Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]`, `results` is a list with two additional elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, a)` for the current and previous iterations, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` by converting `data[idx]` to an integer. The other variables remain in their previous states. The value of `idx` is updated to `idx + n + 1`, and `a` is defined as a list of integers from `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]`. The `results` list is updated with the return values of `func_1(n, a)` for the current and previous iterations.
