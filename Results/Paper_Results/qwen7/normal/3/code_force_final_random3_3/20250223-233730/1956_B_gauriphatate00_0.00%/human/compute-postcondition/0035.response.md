Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes an integer t (number of test cases), followed by an integer n (number of cards) and a list a of integers. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, a)` to determine if it's possible to pair up all cards such that each pair consists of two cards with the same integer. It then prints the results of these calls for all test cases. The function does not modify the input data and only uses the input data to compute and print the results.**
