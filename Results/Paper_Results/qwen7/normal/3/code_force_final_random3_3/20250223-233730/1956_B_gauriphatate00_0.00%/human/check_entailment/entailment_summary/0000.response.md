Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally against an opponent who also plays optimally.
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` calculates the minimum of the number of pairs of identical cards in the list `a` and `n // 2`. This function is supposed to help determine the best strategy for the player.
- `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results. It correctly handles multiple test cases and ensures that the input is read and processed as specified.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries:
- `func_1` is designed to find the maximum number of points you can get by considering the optimal moves against an opponent who maximizes their score while minimizing yours.
- `func_2` correctly processes the input and applies `func_1` to each test case.

Since the logic in `func_1` aligns with the problem's requirements and `func_2` correctly implements the solution, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
