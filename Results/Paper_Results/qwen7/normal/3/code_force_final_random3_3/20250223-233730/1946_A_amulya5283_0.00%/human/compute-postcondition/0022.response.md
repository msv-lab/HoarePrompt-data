Output State: `results` is an empty list, `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `heap`, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `heap`, and `heap` is empty.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the smallest element in the heap (denoted by `heap[0]`) is less than or equal to the current median. Each iteration of the loop increments the `operations` counter by 1, removes the smallest element from the heap, and adds 1 to it before pushing it back into the heap. This process continues until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median, at which point the loop terminates. Since the loop executes once for each element in the heap, the final state will have `operations` equal to the number of elements in the heap, `i` will be greater than or equal to the number of elements in the heap (since `i` increments with each iteration), and the heap will be empty. The `results` list remains empty as it was not modified within the loop.
