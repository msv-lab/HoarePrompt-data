Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in `heap`], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `heap` + 1, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `heap`, and `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index:]`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]**.

Explanation: The `heapq.heapify(heap)` function transforms the list `heap` into a min-heap in-place. This means that the smallest element is moved to the root of the heap, and the heap property is maintained throughout the list. The values of other variables such as `results`, `i`, `operations`, `median_index`, and `current_median` remain unchanged from their initial states.
