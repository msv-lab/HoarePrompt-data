Output State: **`smallest` is 3, `heap` is now a list containing [2, 4, 4], `median_index` is 1, `current_median` is 4, `operations` is increased by 1.**

The code `operations += 1` increments the value of the `operations` variable by 1. Since the initial value of `operations` was not specified, we can only say that it has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
