Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `operations` is 0, `heap` does not contain its first element, and `smallest` is the smallest element from `heap[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. The heap no longer contains its first element, which is now stored in `smallest`. All other variables remain unchanged.
