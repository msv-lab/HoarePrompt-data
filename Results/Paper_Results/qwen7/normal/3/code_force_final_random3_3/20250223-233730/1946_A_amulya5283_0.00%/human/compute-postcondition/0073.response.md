Output State: **`results` is a list containing the total number of operations performed across all test cases, `i` is equal to the total number of test cases, `operations` is the sum of operations performed for each test case, and `heap` is empty.**

This means that after processing all test cases, the program has calculated the total number of operations performed (`results`), recorded the total number of test cases (`i`), summed up the operations for each test case (`operations`), and emptied the heap.
