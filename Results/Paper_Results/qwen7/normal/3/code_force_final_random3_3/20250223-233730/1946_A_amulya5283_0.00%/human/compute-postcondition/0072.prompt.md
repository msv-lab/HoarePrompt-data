Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) followed by `n` integers representing the array `a`. Additionally, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, arr = test_cases[i]
    arr.sort()
    median_index = n // 2
    current_median = arr[median_index]
    heap = arr[median_index:]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    operations = 0
    while heap[0] <= current_median:
        smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
        heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
        operations += 1
    results.append(operations)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is [number of elements in `heap`], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `heap`, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `heap`, and `heap` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is [5], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 6, `operations` is 5, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `current_median + 1 + 5`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap after removing the smallest element twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `smallest` is 7, `heap` is [5, 5, 7], `median_index` is 1, `current_median` is 5, `operations` is increased by 4, `results` is a list containing 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
