Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `heap[0] <= current_median`.

2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is [number of elements in heap - 1]
   - `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 4
   - `operations` is 4
   - `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `current_median + 1`
   - `median_index` is `n // 2`
   - `current_median` is `smallest + 1`
   - `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap after removing the smallest element

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition depends on `heap[0]` and `current_median`.
   - For the loop to continue, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given that `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the min-heap, and it is given that `heap[0]` is `current_median + 1`, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` cannot be satisfied.

Therefore, to make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `heap[0]` becomes less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since `current_median` is defined as `smallest + 1`, and `heap[0]` is `current_median + 1`, we need to reduce `heap[0]` to be `current_median` or less.

However, since the heap is a min-heap and the smallest element is `current_median + 1`, we need to ensure that the smallest element in the heap is adjusted to be `current_median` or less.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

State: **`results` is [number of elements in heap - 1], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 4, `operations` is 4, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `current_median` (or less), `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap after removing the smallest element**
