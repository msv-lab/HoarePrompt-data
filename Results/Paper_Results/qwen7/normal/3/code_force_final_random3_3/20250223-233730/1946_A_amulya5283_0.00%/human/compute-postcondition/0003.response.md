Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr` is a sorted version of the original list from `test_cases` at index `i`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `arr` which was the second element of the tuple in `test_cases` at index `i`. The sorting operation modifies `arr` in place, making it a sorted version of its original content. The other variables (`results` and `i`) remain unchanged.
