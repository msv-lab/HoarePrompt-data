Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in heap - 1], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 4, `operations` is 4, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `current_median`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap after removing the smallest element, `smallest` is popped from the heap.**

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to `smallest`. Since `heap` was a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `current_median`, after popping the smallest element, `smallest` is removed from the heap. All other variables remain unchanged.
