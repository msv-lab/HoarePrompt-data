Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 5, `arr` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], `results` is [5], `operations` is 0, `heap` is now a list containing `[2, 3, 4]`, `median_index` is 2, `current_median` is `2`, `smallest` is `2**.

The code sets the variable `operations` to 0. All other variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
