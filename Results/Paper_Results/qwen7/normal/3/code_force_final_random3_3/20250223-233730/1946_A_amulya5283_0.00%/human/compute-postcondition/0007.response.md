Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr` is a sorted version of the original list from `test_cases` at index `i`, `median_index` is `i // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`, `heap` is a heap data structure formed from `arr[median_index:]`**

Explanation: The `heapq.heapify(heap)` function transforms the list `heap` into a heap data structure in-place. This means that the elements in `heap` are rearranged so that they satisfy the heap property (for a min-heap, each element is less than or equal to its children). The other variables remain unchanged.
