Output State: **`smallest` is popped from `heap`, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `operations` is 1, and `heap` contains its first element which is `smallest + 1` where `smallest` is less than or equal to `current_median - 1`.**

Explanation: The code pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to `smallest`. The other variables (`results`, `i`, `operations`) remain unchanged. The heap's first element is updated to `smallest + 1`, ensuring that it remains less than or equal to `current_median` for the next iteration.
