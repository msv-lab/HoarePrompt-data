Output State: **`smallest` is popped from `heap`; `smallest` is now the new value of the smallest element in `heap`; `results` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `operations` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. The other variables (`results`, `i`, `operations`) remain unchanged.
