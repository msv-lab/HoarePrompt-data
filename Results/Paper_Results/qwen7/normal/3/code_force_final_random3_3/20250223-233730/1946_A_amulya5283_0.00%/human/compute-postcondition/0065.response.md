Output State: **`smallest` is 4, `heap` is now a list containing [4, 5], `median_index` is 1, `current_median` is 4, `operations` is increased by 2**

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to `smallest`. Initially, the heap is `[4, 4, 5]`. Popping the smallest element (which is 4) from the heap leaves us with `[4, 5]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
