Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in `heap`], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `heap` + 1, `operations` is 0, and `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index:]`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]**.

Explanation: The line `operations = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `operations`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
