### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach is efficient for handling large inputs.

2. **Test Cases Parsing**: The program correctly parses each test case, extracting the size of the array and the array itself. The test cases are stored in a list of tuples, which is a good way to manage multiple test cases.

3. **Function Call**: The parsed test cases are passed to the function `func_1`, which is supposed to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of each array.

4. **Median Calculation**:
   - The program sorts the array to find the median.
   - It calculates the median index correctly as `median_index = n // 2`. However, this approach is flawed for arrays with an even number of elements. The median should be the average of the two middle elements in such cases. The program only considers the element at `median_index` without checking the next element.

5. **Heap Usage**:
   - A min-heap is used starting from the middle of the sorted array.
   - The program increments the smallest element in the heap until it exceeds the current median value.
   - This logic is flawed because it doesn't account for the possibility that the median might be the average of two elements in the case of an even-sized array. The program assumes the median is a single element, which is incorrect.

6. **Operations Count**:
   - The program counts the number of operations needed to make the smallest element in the heap greater than the current median.
   - This approach is overly simplistic and doesn't handle the case where the median is the average of two elements.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Sorting and Median Calculation**:
  - The program sorts the array and calculates the median index correctly for odd-sized arrays. However, for even-sized arrays, the median is the average of the two middle elements, not just the element at `median_index`.
  - Example: For the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, but the program would consider `2` as the median.

- **Heap Usage**:
  - The program uses a min-heap starting from the middle of the sorted array, which is not necessary. The heap should be built from the entire array to correctly identify the median.
  - Incrementing the smallest element in the heap until it exceeds the current median is not sufficient. The program needs to ensure that the median is correctly updated for both odd and even-sized arrays.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies the flaws in the program's logic. The program does not handle the case where the median is the average of two elements in the case of an even-sized array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
