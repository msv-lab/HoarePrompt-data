Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 5, `arr` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], `results` is [5], `operations` is 5, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `[1, 2, 3, 4]` with the smallest element being `1`, `median_index` is 2, `current_median` is `1`, `smallest` is `1**.

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr`, which was originally `[4, 0, 1, 2, 3]`. After sorting, `arr` becomes `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `results`, `operations`, `heap`, `median_index`, `current_median`, and `smallest` remain unchanged except for `arr`, which is now sorted.
