State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` must be 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because the `range(t)` function generates numbers from 0 up to but not including `t`.
- The initial value of `i` is 0, as the loop starts with the first iteration where `i` is 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` (it must be an integer between 1 and 1000) and `i` (it must be 0).
