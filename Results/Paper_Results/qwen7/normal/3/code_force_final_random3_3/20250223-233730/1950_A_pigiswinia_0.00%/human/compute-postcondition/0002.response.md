Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `t` being an integer between 1 and 1000 and `i` being 0 remains unchanged. The new variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces.
