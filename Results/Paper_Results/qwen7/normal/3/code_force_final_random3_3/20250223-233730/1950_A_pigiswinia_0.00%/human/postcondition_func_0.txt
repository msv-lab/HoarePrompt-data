The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where for each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range 0 to 9. Based on the values of these integers, it prints either "STAIRS" if \(a < b < c\), "PEAK" if \(a < b > c\), or "NONE" otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return anything but prints the results for each test case.
