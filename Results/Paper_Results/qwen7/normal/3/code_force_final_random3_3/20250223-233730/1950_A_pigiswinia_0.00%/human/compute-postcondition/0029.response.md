Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from the input split, but their specific values are not explicitly stated.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NONE')
```

This `print` statement will output the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **NONE**
