The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference \(k = |n - m|\) and then simplifies \(k\) based on specific conditions. If \(k\) is a power of 2, it remains unchanged. If \(k\) is odd, it also remains unchanged. If \(k\) is even and at least 14, it is reduced to 0 through a series of operations. For even values of \(k\) less than 14, they are similarly reduced to 0. The function outputs the simplified value of \(k\) for each test case.
