Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` is odd, `k` remains unchanged. If `k` is even and at least 14, then `k` is adjusted to be `k - 14`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2`, `p` is the length of `l`, and `f` is `k - 14`.
