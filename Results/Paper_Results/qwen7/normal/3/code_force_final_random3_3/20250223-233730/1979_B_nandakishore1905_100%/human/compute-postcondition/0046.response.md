Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `f` is `k - 2`**.

Explanation: The code `f = k - q` assigns the value of `k - 2` to `f`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
