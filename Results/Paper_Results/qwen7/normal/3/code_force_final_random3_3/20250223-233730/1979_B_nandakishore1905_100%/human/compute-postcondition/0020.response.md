Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is equal to `t`; `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `k` is not a power of two and `k` is even; `l` is the string representation of the binary form of `f` without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\); `f` is `f - q`; `l` is updated to be the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of the new `l`; `q` is recalculated as \(2^{(p - 1)}\)**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `k` is an even number that is not a power of two.
- `f` is calculated as `k - q`, where `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
- After the operation `f = f - q`, `f` is further reduced by `q`.
- Since `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), and `p` is the length of the binary representation of `f`, `q` is half the value of `f` (in terms of its binary representation).
- Therefore, `f` is now half of its previous value in binary form, which means the least significant bit (LSB) of `f` is set to 0.
- `l` is updated to be the binary representation of the new `f` without the '0b' prefix.
- `p` is the length of the new `l`.
- `q` is recalculated as \(2^{(p - 1)}\), which is half the value of the new `f` in binary form.
