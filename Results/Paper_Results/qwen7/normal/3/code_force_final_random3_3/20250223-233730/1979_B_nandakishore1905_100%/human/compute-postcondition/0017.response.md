Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is equal to `t`; `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `k` is not a power of two and `k` is even; `l` is the string representation of the binary form of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\); `f` is `k - q`; `l` is updated to be the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` updates the variable `l` to be the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.
- Since `f` is defined as `k - q`, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `l` is now the binary representation of `f`, which is `k - q`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
