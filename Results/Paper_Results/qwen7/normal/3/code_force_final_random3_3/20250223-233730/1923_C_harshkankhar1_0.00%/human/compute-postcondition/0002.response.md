Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `c` is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `a` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest are the integers from the input split into a list, `b` is a list of length n+1 where every element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `b` with `n + 1` zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
