### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Analysis:**
   - The function reads the input for a single test case, which includes the length `n` of the array `c`, the number of queries `q`, and the array `c` itself.
   - It then calculates the prefix sums of the array `a` (which is initialized to include a leading zero).
   - The variable `b` is also initialized to store prefix sums, but it seems to be used incorrectly in the context of determining if a subarray is "good".
   - The function then iterates through the queries, comparing the sum of elements in the subarray `c[l_i]` to `c[r_i]` with the corresponding prefix sums stored in `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic for Determining if Subarray is Good:**
   - The logic in the function is flawed. Specifically, the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` is not sufficient to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given problem statement.
   - The problem requires that there exists an array `b` such that:
     1. The sum of elements in `a` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
     2. No element in `a` equals the corresponding element in `b`.
     3. All elements in `b` are positive.
   - The current implementation does not ensure these conditions are met.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To determine if a subarray is "good", we need to check if it's possible to rearrange the elements within the subarray such that no element remains in its original position and all elements are positive.
   - A subarray can be "good" if and only if the sum of the subarray is even and the subarray has at least 2 elements (since a subarray with 1 element cannot be "good").
   - If the sum of the subarray is odd, it cannot be "good".

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good". Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:

**False**
