Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is 2**

Explanation: The code snippet `x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2` assigns the value of `x` based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. Since `i` is 1 and `n` must be a positive integer, but there is no specific value given for `a[1]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `x` without knowing `a[1]`. However, since the condition `a[i] > 1` is not specified, we assume the else part is taken, making `x` equal to 2. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
