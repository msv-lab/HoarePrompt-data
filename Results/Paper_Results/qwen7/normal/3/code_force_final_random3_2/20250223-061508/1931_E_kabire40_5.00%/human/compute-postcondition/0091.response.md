Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and has been fully processed, `rev_val` is a list containing all the reversed strings of elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, `rev_res` is a string that contains all the elements from `operational_list` whose reversed strings have the same length as the original strings, concatenated together, `list_len` retains its initial value, which is the length of the first element in `operational_list`, `max_power` retains its initial value, which is the integer value of the second element in `operational_list`, `y` remains equal to the integer value of the input provided, `x` is incremented by 1, and `len(rev_val)` remains the same; `val_in` is the string at index `x` in `rev_val`.**

This output state reflects that the variable `x` has been incremented by 1, and `val_in` now holds the value of the string located at the new index `x` in the list `rev_val`. All other variables retain their previous states.
