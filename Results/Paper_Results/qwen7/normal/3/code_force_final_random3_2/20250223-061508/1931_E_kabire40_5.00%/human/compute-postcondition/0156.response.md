Postcondition: `rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is `k + 2`. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is an integer from `rev_val[x]`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus the reverse of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the element at index `k + 2` in `rev_val`.
