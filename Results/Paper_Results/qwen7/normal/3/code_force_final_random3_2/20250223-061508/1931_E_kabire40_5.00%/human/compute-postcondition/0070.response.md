Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list (after the operation), `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reverse of the string `x` to the list `rev_val`. The original values of `operational_list` and `x` remain unchanged, but now `rev_val` contains the reversed version of `x`.
