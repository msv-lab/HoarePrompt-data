Output State: **`operational_list` must contain at least one element; `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` and then converts it to an integer. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `x`, `x_rev` is described in terms of `x`. The precondition that `operational_list` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
