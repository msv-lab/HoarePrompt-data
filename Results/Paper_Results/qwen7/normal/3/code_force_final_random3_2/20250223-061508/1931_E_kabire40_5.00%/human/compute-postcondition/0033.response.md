Postcondition: `x` is either 0 or 1, `rev_val` contains at least one element, and `rev_res` is the concatenation of the string representation of `val_in` based on the value of `x`: if `x` is 0, `rev_res` is the string representation of `val_in` appended to `rev_res`; if `x` is 1, `rev_res` is `rev_res` concatenated with the reversed string representation of `val_in`.
