Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` will be equal to the total number of elements in `rev_val` - 1.
- `rev_res` will be a string that has been built by concatenating the string representations of integers when `x` is even and the reversed strings when `x` is odd.
- `rev_val` will contain all its original elements as it was not modified within the loop.
- The value of `10` is a standalone integer and does not affect the variables or objects mentioned above.

The `print('Sasha')` statement will simply print the string "Sasha".

Output: **Sasha**
