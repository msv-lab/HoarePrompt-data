Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and must have at least one element; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`.**

Explanation: The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` and then converts it to an integer. Since `x` is a string from the `operational_list`, `x_rev` will be the integer value of the reversed string `x`. The original list `operational_list` remains unchanged.
