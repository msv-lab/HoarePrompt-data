Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`.**

Explanation: The code reverses the string `x` and converts it into an integer, storing it in `x_rev`. The original list `operational_list` and the variable `x` (which was the next element in the list) remain unchanged.
