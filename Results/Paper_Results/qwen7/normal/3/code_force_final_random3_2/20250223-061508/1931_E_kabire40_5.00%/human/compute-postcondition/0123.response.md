Output State: **`operational_list` contains at least one fewer element, `rev_val` now includes the reverse of the last value of `x`, `x` is no longer defined, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the last value of `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends the reverse of the last value of `x` (which is stored in `x_rev`) to the list `rev_val`. Since `x` is no longer defined, it remains undefined. The `operational_list` contains at least one fewer element because `x` was removed from it before this operation. `x_rev` remains unchanged as it is the integer representation of the reversed string of the last value of `x`.
