Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `x` and `operational_list`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `operational_list`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and must have at least one element.
   - `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`.
   - If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by `x`.
   - Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are elements in `operational_list`, the next `x` will be the next element in the list.
   - Therefore, `operational_list` will lose its first element.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `operational_list` will now be the remaining elements of the original list (one element less).
   - `x` will be the next element in the original `operational_list`.

Given the above steps, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list**.
