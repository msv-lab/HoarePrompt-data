Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in operational_list:`. The objects involved here are `x`, `operational_list`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `operational_list` is a list created from the split input.
   - `x` is the variable that will take each element of `operational_list` one by one during the loop iterations.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `operational_list`. If `operational_list` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop depends on `operational_list` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `operational_list` is not empty.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `operational_list` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`operational_list` must contain at least one element**
