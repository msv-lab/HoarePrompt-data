Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string into two parts using the `split()` function, assigning the first part to `list_len` and the second part to `max_power`. The original values of `t`, `rev_val`, and `rev_res` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, `rev_val` and `rev_res` remain empty, and `list_len` and `max_power` take the values from the split input string.
