Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` adds the value of `x` to `rev_res`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `rev_res`, it remains as `rev_res` plus `x`. The other variables (`operational_list`, `x`, and `x_rev`) are not affected by this operation.
