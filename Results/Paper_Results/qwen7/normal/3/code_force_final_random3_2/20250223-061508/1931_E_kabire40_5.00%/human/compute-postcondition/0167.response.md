Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes three inputs: t (a positive integer between 1 and 10^4), n (an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^5), and m (an integer between 0 and 2⋅10^6). Additionally, it receives a list a containing n integers, each between 1 and 10^9. The function returns different outputs based on the inputs for each test case.**

Note: Since the specific output logic isn't provided, the functionality focuses on the input parameters and their constraints.
