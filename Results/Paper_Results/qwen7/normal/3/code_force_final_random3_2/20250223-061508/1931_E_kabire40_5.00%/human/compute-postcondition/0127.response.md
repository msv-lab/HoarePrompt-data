Output State: **`operational_list` must contain at least two fewer elements, `x` is undefined, `x_rev` is 0**

Explanation: The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` attempts to reverse the string `x` and convert it to an integer. Since `x` is undefined, reversing it results in an empty string `''`. Converting an empty string to an integer results in `0`. Therefore, `x_rev` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.
