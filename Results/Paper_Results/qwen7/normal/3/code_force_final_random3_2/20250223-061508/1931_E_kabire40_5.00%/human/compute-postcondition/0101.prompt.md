Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and has been fully processed; `rev_val` is a list containing all the reversed strings of elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order; `rev_res` is a string that contains all the elements from `operational_list` whose reversed strings have the same length as the original strings, concatenated together; `list_len` retains its initial value, which is the length of the first element in `operational_list`; `max_power` retains its initial value, which is the integer value of the second element in `operational_list`; `y` remains equal to the integer value of the input provided.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and has been fully processed, `rev_val` is a list containing all the reversed strings of elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, `rev_res` is a string that contains all the elements from `operational_list` whose reversed strings have the same length as the original strings, concatenated together, `list_len` retains its initial value, which is the length of the first element in `operational_list`, `max_power` retains its initial value, which is the integer value of the second element in `operational_list`, `y` remains equal to the integer value of the input provided. If `x` is even, `x` is incremented by 1 and `val_in` is the integer value of the `(x - 1)`-th element in `rev_val`. Otherwise, `x` is 0, `val_in` is the value of `rev_val[0]`, and `rev_res` is updated by adding the reverse of `val_in`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and has been fully processed, `rev_val` is a list containing all the reversed strings of elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, `rev_res` is a string that contains all the elements from `operational_list` whose reversed strings have the same length as the original strings, concatenated together, `list_len` retains its initial value, which is the length of the first element in `operational_list`, `max_power` retains its initial value, which is the integer value of the second element in `operational_list`, `y` remains equal to the integer value of the input provided, `x` is incremented by 1, `len(rev_val)` remains the same, and `rev_res` is updated based on the value of `x % 2`: if `x % 2 == 0`, `rev_res` is unchanged; otherwise, `rev_res` is the concatenation of `rev_res` and the reverse of the string at index `x` in `rev_val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and has been fully processed, `rev_val` is a list containing all the reversed strings of elements from `operational_list` that do not have the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, `rev_res` is a string that contains all the elements from `operational_list` whose reversed strings have the same length as the original strings, concatenated together, `list_len` retains its initial value, which is the length of the first element in `operational_list`, `max_power` retains its initial value, which is the integer value of the second element in `operational_list`, `y` remains equal to the integer value of the input provided, `x` is now equal to `k + 1`, `len(rev_val)` remains the same, `rev_res` is updated based on the value of `(k + 1) % 2`: if `(k + 1) % 2 == 0`, `rev_res` is unchanged; otherwise, `rev_res` is either appended with the integer value of the string at index `k + 1` in `rev_val` (if `(k + 1) % 2 == 0`) or with the reverse of the string at index `k + 1` in `rev_val` (if `(k + 1) % 2 == 1`), and `val_in` is assigned the integer value of the string at index `k + 1` in `rev_val` if `(k + 1) % 2 == 0` or the reversed string of the element at index `k + 1` in `rev_val` if `(k + 1) % 2 == 1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
