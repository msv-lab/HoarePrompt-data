Output State: **`operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string, excluding the first element; `x` is the second element in the list; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`; `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends the reverse of `x` (a string) to the list `rev_val`. Since `x` is a string, `x[::-1]` reverses the string. The other variables remain unchanged.
