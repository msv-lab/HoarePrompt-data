Postcondition: **`operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string representation of the first element in `operational_list`; if `len(str(x_rev)) == len(x)`, then `rev_res` is equal to `rev_res` plus `x_rev`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list with one element which is the reverse of `x`.**
