Output State: **`operational_list` contains at least one element, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`. Since `x[::-1]` reverses the string `x`, `rev_val` now includes this reversed string. The other variables remain unchanged.
