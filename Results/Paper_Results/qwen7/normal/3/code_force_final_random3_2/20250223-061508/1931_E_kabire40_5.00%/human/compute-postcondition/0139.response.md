Output State: **`rev_val` must have at least 1 element, and `x` is an odd number; `val_in` is the element from `rev_val` at index `x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the element from `rev_val` at index `x` to the variable `val_in`. Since `x` is specified to be an odd number, the value of `val_in` is the element in `rev_val` at that specific odd index. The precondition that `rev_val` must have at least one element remains unchanged.
