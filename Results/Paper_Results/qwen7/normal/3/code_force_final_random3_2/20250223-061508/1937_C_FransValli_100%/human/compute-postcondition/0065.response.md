Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `arr` is `[i+2, i+1]`
   - `item` is `i+1`
   - `res` is `'>'`

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over `arr[1:]`, which means it starts from the second element of `arr`.

3. **Current Values**:
   - Since `arr` is `[i+2, i+1]`, the second element (index 1) is `i+1`.
   - Therefore, `item` is currently `i+1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `item` must be the next element in `arr[1:]`.
   - The next element in `arr[1:]` would be `i+2`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `arr` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `item` changes to `i+2`.
   - `res` remains `'>'` as per the postcondition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`arr` is `[i+2, i+1]`, `item` is `i+2`, `res` is `'>'`**
