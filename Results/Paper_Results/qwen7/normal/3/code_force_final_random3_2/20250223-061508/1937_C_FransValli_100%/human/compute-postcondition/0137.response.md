Output State: **`mini` is equal to `arr[1]`, `item` is `arr[1]`, `res` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is assigned the value of `input()`, which takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. The values of `mini` and `item` remain unchanged, as they are both equal to `arr[1]`.
