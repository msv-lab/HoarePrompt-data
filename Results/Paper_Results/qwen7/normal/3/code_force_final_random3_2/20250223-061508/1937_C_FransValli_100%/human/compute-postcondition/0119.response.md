Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `res` is an input string, `arr` contains the value of `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1` according to the initial state) to the list `arr`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` now contains the value of `i + 1`.
