Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is mentioned to be greater than 1 but no specific value is provided, so we only know this condition.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Here, `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, and there's no context to determine its value from the given information. Therefore, we cannot provide a precise value for `maxi`.

Given the information, the output will include the string `'?'` followed by two instances of `maxi` and two instances of `i`.

Output: **'? [maxi] [maxi] 1 1' (where [maxi] is the undefined value of maxi)**
