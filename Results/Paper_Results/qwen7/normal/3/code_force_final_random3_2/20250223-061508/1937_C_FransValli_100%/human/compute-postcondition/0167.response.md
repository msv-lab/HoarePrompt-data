Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `res` is the input string provided by the user.
   - `i` is an integer, but its value is not explicitly given.
   - `maxi` is equal to `i` if `res` is equal to `<`, otherwise, it is not defined in the initial state.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

Given the initial state, let's consider the possible scenarios for `res`:

- If `res` is equal to `<`, then `maxi = i`.
- If `res` is not equal to `<`, then `maxi` is undefined.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we'll denote it as `i`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (a literal question mark).
- `maxi`, which is `i` if `res` is `<`.
- `maxi` again, which is also `i` if `res` is `<`.
- `i` (the value of `i`).
- `i` (the value of `i`).

The output will be:
Output: **'? [i] [i] [i] [i]** (where `[i]` is the value of `i`)
