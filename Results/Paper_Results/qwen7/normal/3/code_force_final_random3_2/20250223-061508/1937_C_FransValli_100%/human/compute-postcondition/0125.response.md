Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `i + 2`: This means `i` is incremented by 2. Since the exact initial value of `i` is not provided, let's denote it as `i_initial`. Therefore, `i = i_initial + 2`.
   - `n` is the same: This means `n` has the same value as `i`, so `n = i_initial + 2`.
   - `res` is an input string: This is just a string and does not affect the print statement directly.
   - `arr` contains the value of `i + 2`: Since `i` is now `i_initial + 2`, `arr` will contain `i_initial + 2 + 2 = i_initial + 4`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`.
   - `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. We will leave it as `maxi`.
   - `arr[0]` is the first element of `arr`, which we determined is `i_initial + 4`.
   - `i` is `i_initial + 2`.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
- `'?'`: A question mark.
- `maxi`: The value of `maxi`.
- `arr[0]`: The value of `i_initial + 4`.
- `maxi`: The value of `maxi` again.
- `i`: The value of `i_initial + 2`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? maxi i_initial + 4 maxi i_initial + 2'**
