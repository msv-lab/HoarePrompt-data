To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the loop head and identify the relevant variables.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

Here, the loop variable `_` is used to iterate over the integer value obtained from `int(input())`. The loop will execute once for each integer input provided by the user.

### Relevant Variables
- The loop variable `_`: This variable is initialized to the integer value obtained from `int(input())`.
- The integer value itself: This is the number of iterations the loop will perform.

### Initial State
The initial state provided is:
- No specific values for the loop variable or the integer input are given.

### Adjusting the State
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that the loop variable `_` is set to a valid integer value obtained from `input()`.

### Final State
Since the loop will execute based on the integer value provided by `int(input())`, we need to ensure that this value is correctly set before the loop starts. Therefore, the state should reflect that the loop will execute for the integer value obtained from the input.

State: **The integer value obtained from `int(input())` must be a positive integer (since `range` in Python starts from 0 and includes all integers up to but not including the stop value).**

However, since the exact value is not known until runtime, we cannot specify a concrete value. Instead, we need to ensure that the loop can execute for any valid input.

### Final Answer
State: **The integer value obtained from `int(input())` must be a positive integer.**

This ensures that the loop can execute for any valid input provided by the user.
