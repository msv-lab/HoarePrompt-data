Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is the final input string provided by the user after the loop has executed all its iterations.
- `maxi` is equal to `n-1`.
- `i` must be between 1 and `n-1` inclusive.
- `arr` is a list containing only one element which is 0.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the components to be printed:

1. `'?'`: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
2. `maxi`: As stated, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`.
3. `arr[0]`: Since `arr` contains only one element which is 0, `arr[0]` is 0.
4. `maxi`: Again, this is `n-1`.
5. `i`: This variable is between 1 and `n-1` inclusive.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? n-1 0 n-1 [i]** (where `[i]` is any integer between 1 and `n-1` inclusive).
