Output State: **`mini` is equal to `arr[0]`, `i` is equal to `n`, `res` is an input string, and `arr` contains the values from 1 to n-1.**

Explanation: The line `mini = arr[0]` assigns the first element of the list `arr` to the variable `mini`. The values of `i`, `res`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
