Output State: **arr is [i+2, i+1], mini is i+2, n is at least i + 2, maxi is 0, res is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `arr` (which is `i+2`) to the variable `mini`. Since `arr` is initially `[i+2, i+1]`, `mini` is set to `i+2`. The other variables (`n`, `maxi`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
