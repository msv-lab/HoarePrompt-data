Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `res` is the input string entered by the user, and if the current value of `res` is equal to '<', then `maxi` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value entered by the user as the new value of `res`. The initial conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition for `maxi` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is equal to '<', then `maxi` is set to 2. Otherwise, the value of `maxi` remains undefined based on the given information.
