Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is defined as `[i+2, i+1]`. This means that `arr` is a list containing two elements: `i+2` and `i+1`.
   - `item` is defined as `i+2`. So, `item` is the same as the first element of the list `arr`.
   - `res` is defined as `'>'`. This variable is not used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)`.
   - There is no variable named `mini` mentioned in the initial state, so we assume `mini` is a typo or a placeholder. Given the context, it seems like it might be intended to be `item` or another variable, but since it's not defined, we'll treat it as a typo and assume it should be `item`.

Given this understanding, the print statement should be interpreted as:
```python
print('?', item, item, item, item, flush=True)
```

Since `item` is `i+2`, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` followed by four instances of `i+2`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? (i+2) (i+2) (i+2) (i+2)'**
