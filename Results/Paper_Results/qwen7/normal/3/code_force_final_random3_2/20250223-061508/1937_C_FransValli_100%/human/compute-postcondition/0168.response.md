Output State: **`res` is the input string provided by the user, `maxi` is equal to `i` if `res` is equal to `<`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. The initial conditions for `maxi` and `i` remain unchanged unless the condition `res == '<'` is met. Since the condition is not evaluated in the given code snippet, `maxi` remains as it was initially defined (equal to `i` if `res` was equal to `<`), and `i` is incremented by 1.
