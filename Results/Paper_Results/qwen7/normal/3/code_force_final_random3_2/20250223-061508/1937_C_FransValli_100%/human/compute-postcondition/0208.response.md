Output State: **`res` is a new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is `n+1`, and `arr` is either `[n, n+1]` or `[n, n, n+1]` depending on the value of `res`.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Initially, `i` is equal to `n`, so it is appended to `arr`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1, making it `n+1`. The value of `maxi` remains unchanged as `n-1`. The value of `res` changes to a new input string from the user, but its initial state is not relevant to the final state after executing the code. The value of `arr` depends on its initial state, which is either `[n]` or `[n, n]`, and after appending `i`, it becomes either `[n, n+1]` or `[n, n, n+1]`.
