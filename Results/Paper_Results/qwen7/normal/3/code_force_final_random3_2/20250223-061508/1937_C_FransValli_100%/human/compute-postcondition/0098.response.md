Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `res` is the input string entered by the user, and `maxi` is 3.**

Explanation: The code sets `maxi` to the value of `i`, which is 3. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` remains 3, `n` must still be greater than 2, `res` remains the input string entered by the user, and `maxi` is now 3.
