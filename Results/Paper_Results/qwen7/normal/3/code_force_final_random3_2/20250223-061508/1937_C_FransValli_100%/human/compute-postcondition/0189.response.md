Output State: **`res` is '=', `maxi` is `n-1`, `i` is between 1 and `n-1` inclusive, `arr` is a list containing `[0, i]`**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains only the element `0`. After appending `i`, `arr` now contains `[0, i]`. All other variables (`res`, `maxi`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
