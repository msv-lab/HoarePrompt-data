Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified, so we only know this condition.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value precisely. We will leave it as `maxi` in the output.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2, so both instances of `i` will be printed as 2.

Therefore, the output will include the literal string `'?'`, followed by `maxi`, then another `maxi`, and finally the number 2 twice.

Output: **'? maxi maxi 2 2'**
