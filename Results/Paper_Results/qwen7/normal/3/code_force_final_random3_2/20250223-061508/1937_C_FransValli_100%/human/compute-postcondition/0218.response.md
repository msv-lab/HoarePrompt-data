Output State: **`mini` is equal to `arr[0]`, `res` is the new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is either `n` or `n+1`, `arr` must be one of `[n, n+1]` or `[n, n, n+1]; res` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `res`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `res` as the new input string from the user, while keeping the initial states of `mini`, `maxi`, `i`, and `arr`.
