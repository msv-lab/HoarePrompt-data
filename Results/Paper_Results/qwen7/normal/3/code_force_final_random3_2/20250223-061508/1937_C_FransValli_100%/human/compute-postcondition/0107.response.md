Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `res` is an input string equal to '<', `arr` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` and adds the value of `i` to it. Since `i` must be less than `n`, this condition remains unchanged. The value of `res` is also unchanged and is an input string equal to '<'.
