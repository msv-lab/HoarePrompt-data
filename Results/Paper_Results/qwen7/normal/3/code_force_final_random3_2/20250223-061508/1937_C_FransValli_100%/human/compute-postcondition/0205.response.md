Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`res`**: This is a new input string from the user. Since the actual value of `res` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. However, it will be used to decide the form of `arr`.

2. **`maxi`**: It is explicitly stated that `maxi` is equal to `n-1`. So, `maxi = n-1`.

3. **`i`**: It is explicitly stated that `i` is `n`. So, `i = n`.

4. **`arr`**: The value of `arr` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is a single character, `arr` will be `[n]`. If `res` is a two-character string, `arr` will be `[n, n]`.

Given these details, let's consider both possible cases for `arr`:

- If `res` is a single character, then `arr = [n]`.
- If `res` is a two-character string, then `arr = [n, n]`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Case 1: `res` is a single character
- `maxi = n-1`
- `arr[0] = n` (since `arr = [n]`)
- `i = n`

So, the print statement will output:
```
?, n-1, n, n-1, n
```

### Case 2: `res` is a two-character string
- `maxi = n-1`
- `arr[0] = n` (since `arr = [n, n]`)
- `i = n`

So, the print statement will output:
```
?, n-1, n, n-1, n
```

In both cases, the output is the same because `arr[0]` is always `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **?, n-1, n, n-1, n**
