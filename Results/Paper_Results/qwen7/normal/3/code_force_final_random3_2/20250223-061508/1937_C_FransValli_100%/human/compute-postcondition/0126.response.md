Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the same, `res` is an input string, and `arr` contains the value of `i + 2`**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value entered by the user to the variable `res`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `i + 2`, `n` remains the same, `res` is now the input string provided by the user, and `arr` still contains the value of `i + 2`.
