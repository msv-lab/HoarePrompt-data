Output State: **`i` must be less than `n`, `res` is an input string, `res` is not equal to '<', and the current value of `res` is '=', `arr` contains the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `i` must be less than `n` and `res` is not equal to '<' and its current value is '=', these conditions remain unchanged. After executing the code, `arr` now includes the value of `i`.
