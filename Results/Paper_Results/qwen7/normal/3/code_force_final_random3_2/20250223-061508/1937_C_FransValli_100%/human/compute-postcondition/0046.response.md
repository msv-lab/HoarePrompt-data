Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` generates values from 1 to `n-1`).

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is either `[i]` or `[0, i, i]`.
   - `n` is at least `i + 1`.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `res` is the input string from the user.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, we know that:
     - If `res` is `<`, then `arr` becomes `[i]`.
     - If `res` is `=`, then `arr` remains `[i]`.
     - If `res` is `>`, then `arr` becomes `[0, i, i]`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `n` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop body.
   - `maxi` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop body.
   - `res` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop body.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value `k` (where `k` is between 1 and `n-2`), and `n` is at least `k + 1`.
- For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `arr` is either `[k+1]` or `[0, k+1, k+1]` depending on the value of `res`.
- `n` is at least `(k + 1) + 1` or `k + 2`.
- `maxi` is still 0.
- `res` remains the same.

Since the exact value of `res` is not specified, we will keep it as a variable.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`arr` is either `[i+1]` or `[0, i+1, i+1]`, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the input string from the user.**
