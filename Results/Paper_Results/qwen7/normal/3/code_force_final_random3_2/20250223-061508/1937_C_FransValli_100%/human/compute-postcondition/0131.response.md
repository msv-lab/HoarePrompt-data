Postcondition: `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the same, `res` is an input string, and `arr` contains the value of `i + 2`. If `res` equals `'<'`, then `i` remains as `i + 2` and `arr` contains the value of `i + 2`. If `res` equals `'='`, then `i` is appended to itself (i.e., `i = i + i`) and added to `arr`.
