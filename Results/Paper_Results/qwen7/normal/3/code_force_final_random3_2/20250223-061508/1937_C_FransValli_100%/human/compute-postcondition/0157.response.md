Output State: **`mini` is equal to `arr[n-1]`, `item` is `arr[n-1]`, `res` is an input string, `n` is an input integer greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which must be greater than 0) to the variable `n`. The values of `mini`, `item`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
