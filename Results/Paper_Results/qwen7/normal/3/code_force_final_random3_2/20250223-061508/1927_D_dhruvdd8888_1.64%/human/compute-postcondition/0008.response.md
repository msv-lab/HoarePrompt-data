Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `N + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(N + 1):` will start with `i = 0` and continue until `i < N + 1`.
   - Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be `0`, and `N` must be a non-negative integer.

3. **Check the Given States**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\).
   - `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`.
   - `N` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())` with an additional element `-1` appended to it.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `e` is 0.
   - `num` is the first element of the list `nums`.
   - `arr` is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `N` is obtained from `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `N` is a valid integer.
   - The initial value of `i` should be `0`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `N` must be a non-negative integer (since `range(N + 1)` requires `N` to be non-negative).

Therefore, the final state is:
**`N` must be a non-negative integer, and `i` is 0**.

So, the answer is:
State: **`N` must be a non-negative integer, and `i` is 0**.
