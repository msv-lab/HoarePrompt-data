Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration
- `N` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `N + 1`.
- `s` is `N`.
- `num` is equal to `nums[N]`.
- `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`).
- `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `eli` is the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is controlled by the input to the loop, specifically `int(input())`.

### Loop Body
The loop body is omitted, but we know that the loop will execute based on the input provided.

### Adjusting States for Next Iteration
Since the loop is controlled by the input `int(input())`, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself. The loop will execute one more time if the input is a positive integer.

### Updated State
- `N` remains as it was because it is not affected by the loop.
- `i` remains as it was because it is not affected by the loop.
- `s` remains as it was because it is not affected by the loop.
- `num` remains as it was because it is not affected by the loop.
- `arr` remains as it was because it is not affected by the loop.
- `LA` remains as it was because it is not affected by the loop.
- `l` and `r` remain as they were because they are not affected by the loop.
- `eli` remains as it was because it is not affected by the loop.

The only thing that changes is the input to the loop, which will be read from the user.

### Final Answer
State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s` is `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`), and `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `eli` is the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`, and the input for the next iteration is an integer.**

Note: The exact value of the input integer is not specified, but it must be a positive integer for the loop to continue executing.
