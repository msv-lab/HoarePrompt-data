Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(N + 1)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = N`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `N` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `num` is equal to `nums[0]`.
   - `arr` contains a tuple `(2, 0, num)`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < N + 1`. Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will execute again if `i` becomes 1.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 1.
   - `s`, `num`, and `arr` do not change based on the loop head alone; they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `num` is equal to `nums[0]`, and `arr` contains a tuple (2, 0, num)**
