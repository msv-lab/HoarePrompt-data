Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `N` inclusive. Therefore, the loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was either `1` or `2`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `i` was either `1` or `2` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by `1`.
   - If `i` was `1`, it becomes `2`.
   - If `i` was `2`, it becomes `3`.
   - In both cases, `i` must now be `3` for the loop to execute one more time.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`N`, `s`, `num`, and `arr`) are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 3, `s` is either 0 or 2, `num` is equal to `nums[i]`, and `arr` contains tuples (2, 0, `nums[i]`) and (1, 1, `nums[i]`)**.
