Output State: `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s` is `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, and `arr` contains tuples (2, 0, `nums[0]`), (1, 1, `nums[1]`), (2, 3, `nums[3]`), ..., (2, `N-1`, `nums[N-1]`), and (1, `N`, `nums[N]`).

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` will be `N + 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `N` inclusive. The variable `s` will be `N` as it gets updated to the current index `i` whenever a new segment of numbers starts. The variable `num` will be set to the last element of the list `nums`, which is `nums[N]`. The list `arr` will contain all the segments where the value of `num` changes, starting from the second occurrence of each number and ending just before the next different number appears.
