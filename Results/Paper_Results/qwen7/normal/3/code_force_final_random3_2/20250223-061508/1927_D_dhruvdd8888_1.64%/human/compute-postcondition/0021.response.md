Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 3, `s` is either 0 or 2, `num` is equal to `nums[3]`, and `arr` contains tuples (2, 0, `nums[3]`), (1, 1, `nums[3]`), and (2, 3, `num`).**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. Given the initial conditions, `s` is either 0 or 2, so `1 + s` becomes either 1 or 3. Since `i` is 3 and `num` is equal to `nums[i]` (which is `nums[3]`), the new tuple added to `arr` is `(2, 3, nums[3])`. Therefore, the updated list `arr` now contains three tuples: `(2, 0, nums[3])`, `(1, 1, nums[3])`, and `(2, 3, nums[3])`.
