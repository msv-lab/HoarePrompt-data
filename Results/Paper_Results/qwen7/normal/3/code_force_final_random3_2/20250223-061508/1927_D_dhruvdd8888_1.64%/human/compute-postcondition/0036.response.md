Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `N` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is `N + 1`.
   - `s` is `N`.
   - `num` is equal to `nums[N]`.
   - `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`).
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - The current value of `tc` is greater than 5.
   - The condition `ppp == 23` is true.

2. **Determine Values:**
   - Since `i` is `N + 1`, and `s` is `N`, let's assume `N` is some specific value, say `N = 5` (though the actual value of `N` isn't crucial for determining `l` and `r`).
     - Therefore, `i = N + 1 = 6` and `s = N = 5`.
   - The `arr` list would look like this: `[ (2, 0, nums[0]), (1, 1, nums[0]), ..., (6, 5, nums[5]) ]`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one, so if `arr` has 7 elements, `LA = 6`.
   - `l` and `r` are obtained from the input, but since they are not specified in the initial state, we'll keep them as `l` and `r`.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(l, r)`.
   - Since `l` and `r` are obtained from the input, their values depend on the user input.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output the values of `l` and `r` as obtained from the input.

Output: **l, r**
