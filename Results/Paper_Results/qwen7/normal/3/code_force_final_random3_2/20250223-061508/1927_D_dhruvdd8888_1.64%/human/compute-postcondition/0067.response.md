Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s` is `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`), and `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `eli` is the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`, and the input for the next iteration is an integer, `l` and `r` are now specific integers obtained from the input. The continue statement does not change any variable values or the state of the program, it only continues the loop.**

This means that the loop will continue to the next iteration without changing any of the current variable values or the state of the array `arr`.
