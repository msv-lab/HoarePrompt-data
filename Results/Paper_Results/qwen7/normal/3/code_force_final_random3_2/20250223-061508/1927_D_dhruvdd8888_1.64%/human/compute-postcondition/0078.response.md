Postcondition: **`eli` is the index found by bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0)), `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s` is `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`), `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using map(int, input().split()), `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, and `tc` is greater than 5. If `e >= r`, then `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at index `LA`. Otherwise, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.**
