Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly parses the input and initializes necessary variables.
2. It constructs a list `arr` that captures the transitions where the value of the array changes.
3. For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `arr` that corresponds to the query range `[l, r]`.
4. Based on the positions found in `arr`, it determines whether there exists a pair `(i, j)` within the query range `[l, r]` such that `a_i â‰  a_j`.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the annotations, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program checks for the existence of different elements within the specified range for each query and prints the appropriate indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Correctness: **True**
