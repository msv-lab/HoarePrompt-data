Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s` is `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`), and `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one. If `ppp` equals 23, no changes are made to the variables.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if tc > 5:
        if ppp == 23:
            print(l, r)
        continue
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s` is `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`), and `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `eli` is the index found by bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0)). If `s` equals 1, then `s` remains 1, `e` remains unchanged, and `_` remains unchanged. If `s` is greater than 1 and `(e >= r)` is true, `s` remains `N`, `e` is updated to the value of `arr[min(eli, LA)][1]`, and `_` is updated to the value of `arr[min(eli, LA)][2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `N`, `e` is less than `N`, and `_` is updated to the value of `arr[min(eli, LA)][2]`. Additionally, the value of `s` is less than or equal to `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `eli` is the index found by bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0)), `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`. If `s` equals 1 or `e >= r`, then `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at index `LA`. Otherwise, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`. `tc` is greater than 5.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `eli` is the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `l` and `r` are assigned the values from the tuple split by space and converted to integers, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, and `tc` is greater than 5; in both cases, `s`, `e`, and `_` are updated to the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
