You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; for each query, l and r are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s` is `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, and `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`).
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `N + 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `N`. The variable `s` will be `N` since it is updated to `i` whenever `nums[i]` changes. The variable `num` will be set to the last element of the list `nums`, which is `nums[N]`. The list `arr` will contain all the transitions where `num` changes, starting from the first element and ending with the last transition before the loop exits.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: [nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[N]]
    #State: `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s` is `N`, `num` is equal to `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples starting from (2, 0, `nums[0]`), followed by (1, 1, `nums[0]`), and ending with a tuple (1 + `s`, `N`, `nums[N]`), and `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one. If `ppp` equals 23, no changes are made to the variables.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: Output State: `N` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `N + 1`, `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, and `tc` is greater than 5 after all iterations. The variable `l` and `r` will contain the last values obtained from the input split and converted to integers. The variable `eli` will hold the final index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`. The state of the other variables (`arr`, `LA`, `ppp`) remains unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n (an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5), a (a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6), and q (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5). For each query defined by l and r (integers where 1 <= l < r <= n), the function processes a sublist of a from index l to r and returns a result based on the queries.
