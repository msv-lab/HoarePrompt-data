Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `arr` is a list containing tuples. It starts with `(2, 0, nums[0])`, then `(1, 1, nums[0])`, and ends with `(1 + s, N, nums[N])`.
   - `eli` is the result of `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`. This function returns the position in the sorted list `arr` where the value `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain order. Since `arr` starts with `(2, 0, nums[0])` and `(1, 1, nums[0])`, if `l` is 1, `eli` will be 1; otherwise, it will be 0.
   - `N` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is `N + 1`.
   - `s` is `N`.
   - `num` is `nums[N]`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
   - `tc` is greater than 5.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   ```python
   print(-1, -1)
   ```

Given the above analysis, the code snippet simply prints `-1 -1`.

Output: **-1 -1**
