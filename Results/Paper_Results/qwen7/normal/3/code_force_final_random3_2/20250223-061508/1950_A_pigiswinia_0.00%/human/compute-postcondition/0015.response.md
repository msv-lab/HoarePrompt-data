Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input.**

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` also remains unchanged with its value being 1.
