Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is equal to `t-1`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, and `c` is the third integer from the input for each iteration. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will reflect the last input provided during the loop's execution. The variable `i` will be set to `t-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`, inclusive. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the ones provided in the last input since they are redefined in each iteration but not stored or changed outside the loop.
