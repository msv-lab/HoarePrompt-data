Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(t \geq 2\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since neither part modifies the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, the overall postcondition after the if-else block executes is simply the same as the precondition.
