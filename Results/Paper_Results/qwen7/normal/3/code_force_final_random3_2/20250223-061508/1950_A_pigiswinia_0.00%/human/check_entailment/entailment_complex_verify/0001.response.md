### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Input**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIRS' if this condition is met. This part is correct.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met. However, the condition `a < b > c` should actually be `a < b and b > c` to correctly identify a peak. The current implementation uses a chained comparison which is incorrect.
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'NONE'. This part is correct.

Given that the condition for identifying a peak is incorrect, the program will not behave as intended for some test cases. Specifically, it will incorrectly identify some peaks as neither (e.g., for the input `3 4 1`, the program will print 'NONE' instead of 'PEAK').

### Conclusion:

The program logic does not match the problem requirements accurately due to the incorrect peak condition check.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
