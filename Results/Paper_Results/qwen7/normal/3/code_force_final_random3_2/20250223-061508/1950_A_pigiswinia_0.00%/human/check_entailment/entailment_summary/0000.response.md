Reasoning:
- The program correctly defines the conditions for a stair and a peak.
- It iterates through each test case and checks the conditions accurately.
- The program handles multiple test cases as specified by the input \(t\).
- The conditions for 'STAIRS' and 'PEAK' are correctly implemented using the chained comparison operators `<` and `>`.

Given the provided execution summary and the code logic, the program appears to be functioning as expected according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
