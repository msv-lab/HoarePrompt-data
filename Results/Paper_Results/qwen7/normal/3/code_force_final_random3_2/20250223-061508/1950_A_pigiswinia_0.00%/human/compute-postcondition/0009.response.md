Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers split from the input.
- The condition `a < b > c` is false.

The print statement is `print('NONE')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output will be:

Output: **NONE**
