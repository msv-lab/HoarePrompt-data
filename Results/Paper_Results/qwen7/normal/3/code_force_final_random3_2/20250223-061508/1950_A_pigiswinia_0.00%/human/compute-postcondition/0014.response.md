Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers split from the input.
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `t-1`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers split from the input.**
