Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and we read an input integer for `t`.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, after executing the code, `t` will now hold the specific integer input from the user within this range. The other conditions and constraints on `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged and are still valid.
