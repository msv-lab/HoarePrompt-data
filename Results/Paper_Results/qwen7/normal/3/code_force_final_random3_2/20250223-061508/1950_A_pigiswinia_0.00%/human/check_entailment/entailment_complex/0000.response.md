Reasoning:

1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. If either condition is met, it prints the corresponding string ('STAIRS' or 'PEAK').
5. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
6. The function handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.
7. There are no logical errors or missing parts in the implementation.

Given the above points, the function appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
