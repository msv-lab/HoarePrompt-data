The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where each test case consists of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (each between 0 and 9). For each test case, it prints 'STAIRS' if \(a < b < c\), 'PEAK' if \(a < b > c\), and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.
