Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `minn` is 1 (this is not part of the loop head).
   - `same` is 2 (this is not part of the loop head).
   - `i` is 4.
   - `len(ar)` is not given directly, but we know that for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

3. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time**: 
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 4, `len(ar)` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

4. **Formulate the answer**: We only need to adjust the state of `i` and `len(ar)` for the loop to execute one more time. However, since `len(ar)` is not directly provided, we can only ensure that `i` is less than `len(ar)` by adjusting `i` to be less than `len(ar)`.

Given that `i` is 4, `len(ar)` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is 2, `i` is less than `len(ar)` and `len(ar)` must be greater than 4**
