Based on the initial state provided:

- `same` is between 1 and `len(ar)`.
- `num` is the last element that was equal to `ar[i-1]` before the loop ended.
- `i` is `len(ar)`.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop.
- `minn` is not equal to infinity.

The print statement is `print(minn)`. 

Given that `minn` is explicitly described as the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop and it is not equal to infinity, we need to determine the value of `minn`.

Since `same` is between 1 and `len(ar)`, and `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, `minn` must be a positive integer within this range. However, without the actual values of `ar` and the loop details, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `minn`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `minn`, which is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value of same encountered during the loop)**
