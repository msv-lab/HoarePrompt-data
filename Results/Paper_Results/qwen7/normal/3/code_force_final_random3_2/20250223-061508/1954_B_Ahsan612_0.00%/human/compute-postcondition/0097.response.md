Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `same` is 1
   - `num` is `ar[0]`
   - `i` is 1
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `minn` is infinity
   - `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**: The loop condition depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `ar`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `i` is currently 1
   - We need to check the length of the list `ar` to determine if `i < len(ar)`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` (which is 1) must be less than `len(ar)`.
   - Therefore, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(ar)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1**
