Output State: **`same` is 3, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 4, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
