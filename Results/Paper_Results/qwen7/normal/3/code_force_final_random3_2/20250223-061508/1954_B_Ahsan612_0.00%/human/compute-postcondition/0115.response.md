Output State: **`same` is either 3 or 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `same`, `num`, `minn`, `t`, `n`, and the list `ar` with its specific element `ar[i]` (which is equal to `num`) are still as they were in the initial state.
