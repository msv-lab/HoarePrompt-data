Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `input()`, which is used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `same` is between 1 and `len(ar)`.
   - `num` is the last element that was equal to `ar[i-1]` before the loop ended.
   - `i` is `len(ar)`.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, which is either equal to infinity (if it was not updated within the loop) or a finite value (if it was updated).

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will run for the number of times specified by `int(input())`.

4. **Adjusting States**: Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the state of the loop will change based on the input provided. The key state to adjust is the number of iterations left, which is determined by the input.

5. **New State**: After the loop runs once, the input for the next iteration will be taken. Therefore, the new state will depend on the input provided for the next iteration.

Given the current state and the loop condition, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input for the next iteration.

**State:**
- `same` is between 1 and `len(ar)`.
- `num` is the last element that was equal to `ar[i-1]` before the loop ended.
- `i` is `len(ar)`.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, which is either equal to infinity (if it was not updated within the loop) or a finite value (if it was updated).

Since the loop will run again based on the next input, the new state will be:

**State: **`same` is between 1 and `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element that was equal to `ar[i-1]` before the loop ended, `i` is `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the next input integer, and `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, which is either equal to infinity (if it was not updated within the loop) or a finite value (if it was updated).**
