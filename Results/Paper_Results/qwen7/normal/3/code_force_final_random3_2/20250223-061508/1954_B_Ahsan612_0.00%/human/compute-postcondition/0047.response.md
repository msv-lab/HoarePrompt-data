Output State: **`same` is 1, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was processed, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `same = 1` updates the variable `same` to the integer value 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
