Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `same` is 1
   - `num` is `ar[0]`
   - `i` is 1
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `minn` is infinity

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute the first time if `i` is less than `len(ar)`.
   - Currently, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Since `i` is already set to 1, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is at least 2 (because 1 < 2 would satisfy the loop condition).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(ar)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, and `len(ar)` must be at least 2**
