Output State: **`same` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1, so `same` becomes 2. The values of `num`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `minn`, and `ar[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
