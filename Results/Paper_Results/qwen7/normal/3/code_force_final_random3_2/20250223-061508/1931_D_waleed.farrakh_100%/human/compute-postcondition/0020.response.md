Output State: `idx` is equal to `t * 2 + 1`, `t` is 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the last relevant line of `data` and converting each element to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples `(n, x, y, arr)`, where each tuple represents the values read from the input during each iteration of the loop.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `idx` will be at the position right after the last processed line (since it increments by 2 each time), `t` will be 0 as all test cases have been processed, and `test_cases` will contain all the test case details collected during the loop's execution.
