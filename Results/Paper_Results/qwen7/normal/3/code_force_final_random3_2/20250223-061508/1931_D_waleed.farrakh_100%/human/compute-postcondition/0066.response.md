Output State: **`arr` is the fifth element of the next `test_case` and contains at least one element; `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x; `ry` is a % y; `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y); `count` remains unchanged; `ry` is a % y.**

Explanation: The code `ry = a % y` updates the value of `ry` to be the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
