Output State: **`arr` is the fifth element of the next `test_case` and contains at least one element; `a` is the value of `arr`; `rx` is ((-a % x + x) % x)**

Explanation: The code calculates `rx` using the formula `(-a % x + x) % x`. Since `a` is the value of `arr`, `rx` is computed based on the value of `a` and `x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
