Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from splitting `data[idx]` and converting each element to an integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is increased by 2**.

This means that `t` is decremented by 1 and must remain greater than 0. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are set to the integers obtained from splitting and converting the string at `data[idx]`. Similarly, `arr` is updated to be the list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the string at `data[idx + 1]`. Finally, `idx` is increased by 2.
