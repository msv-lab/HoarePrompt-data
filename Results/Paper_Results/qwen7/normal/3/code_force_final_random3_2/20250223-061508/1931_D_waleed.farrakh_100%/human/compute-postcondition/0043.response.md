Output State: **`results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is the sum of all increments made during the loop, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` encountered in `arr`, and `current_pair` is the last pair considered in the loop.**

This means that after executing the provided code snippet, the `results` list now contains one element, which is the final value of `count`. The `count` variable holds the sum of all increments made during the loop. The `freq` dictionary has been updated to contain the frequency of each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` encountered in the array `arr`. Additionally, the `current_pair` variable, which was used to keep track of the current pair during the loop, now holds the last pair considered.
