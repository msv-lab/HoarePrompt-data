Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from splitting `data[idx]` and converting each element to an integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `idx` is increased by 2, `arr` is updated to be a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr` by converting the elements of `data[idx + 1]` into integers and mapping them into a list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `idx` is increased by 2, and `arr` is redefined based on the new value of `data[idx + 1]`.
