Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` will be an empty list, `rx` will be the last calculated value of (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` will be the last calculated value of a % y, `count` will be the sum of `freq[rx, ry]` for all pairs where `rx` and `ry` match any previously seen pairs, `current_pair` will be the last calculated pair of (a % x, a % y), and `results` will contain the final value of `count`. The dictionary `freq` will store the frequency of each unique `(a % x, a % y)` pair seen throughout the loop.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. Since `count` reflects the total occurrences of specific `(a % x, a % y)` pairs based on previous encounters, appending it to `results` means that `results` now contains the final value of `count`. All other variables remain in their final states from the loop execution.
