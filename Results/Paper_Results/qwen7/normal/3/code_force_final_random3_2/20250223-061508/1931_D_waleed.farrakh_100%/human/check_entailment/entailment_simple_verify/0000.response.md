### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):

1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `freq` is a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.

2. **Loop Through Array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - Calculate `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`.
     - Calculate `ry` as `a % y`.
     - Check if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, add the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

3. **Result Collection**:
   - Append the count of beautiful pairs to `results`.

4. **Return Results**:
   - Return the list `results` containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the entire input from standard input and split it into lines.
   - Extract the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Extract `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
     - Append the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Call `func_1` with `test_cases` to get the results.
   - Print each result in `results`.

#### Annotations Analysis:

- **Initial State**:
  - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

- **After Processing**:
  - `test_cases` remains unchanged.
  - `results` contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

- **Final State**:
  - `t` is 0.
  - `idx` is 4.
  - `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are as they were in the last iteration.
  - `test_cases` is an empty list.
  - `results` contains the counts of beautiful pairs for all test cases.

#### Correctness Evaluation:

1. **Modulo Operations**:
   - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always non-negative and less than `x`.
   - `ry` is directly computed as `a % y`.

2. **Pair Frequency Tracking**:
   - The `freq` dictionary correctly tracks the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - When a pair is encountered again, its frequency is incremented, allowing the program to count the number of beautiful pairs efficiently.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles large inputs within the constraints (up to \(2 \times 10^5\) elements per array).
   - It correctly processes multiple test cases and handles the input format as specified.

4. **Logic Flow**:
   - The logic flow is consistent and follows the problem description accurately.
   - The program correctly identifies and counts beautiful pairs based on the given conditions.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
