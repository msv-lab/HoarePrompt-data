Output State: **`arr` is the fourth element of the next `test_case` and must contain at least one element; `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x; `ry` is a % y.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a % y` to `ry`. Since the initial value of `rx` was defined as `(-a % x + x) % x`, it remains unchanged. The variable `arr` and its condition also remain unaffected.
