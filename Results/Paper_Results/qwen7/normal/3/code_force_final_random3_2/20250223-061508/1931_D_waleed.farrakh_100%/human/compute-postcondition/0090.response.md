Output State: **`n` is decremented by 1, `x` remains the same, `y` remains the same, `arr` is the next test case's array, `test_cases` is the remaining list of test cases, `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, or `test_cases`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged except for the addition of the `freq` dictionary which is empty.
