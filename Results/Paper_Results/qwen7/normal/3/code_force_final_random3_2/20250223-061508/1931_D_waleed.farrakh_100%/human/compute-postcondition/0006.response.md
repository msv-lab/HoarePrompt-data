Output State: **`idx` is 2, `n` is an integer value, `x` is an integer value, `y` is an integer value, `data` is a list containing the lines from `sys.stdin.read` split by lines, `t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` retain their original values, `test_cases` is an empty list**

Explanation: The line `n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())` splits the string at `data[idx]` into substrings and converts each substring into an integer, assigning them to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. After this operation, `idx` is incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2) to point to the next line in the `data` list. All other variables retain their original values.
