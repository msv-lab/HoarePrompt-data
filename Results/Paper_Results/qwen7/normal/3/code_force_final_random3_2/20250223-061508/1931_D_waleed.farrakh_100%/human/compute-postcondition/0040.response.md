Postcondition: `a` is now the next element in `arr`; `current_pair` is \((a \% x, a \% y)\); `rx` is \((-a \% x + x) \% x\); `ry` is now \(a \% y\); `count` is increased by either `freq[(rx, ry)]` (if \((rx, ry)\) is in `freq`) or 1 (otherwise); `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1 if \((rx, ry)\) was not already in `freq`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
