You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array). Each element in arr is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        freq = {}
        
        count = 0
        
        for a in arr:
            rx = (-a % x + x) % x
            ry = a % y
            if (rx, ry) in freq:
                count += freq[rx, ry]
            current_pair = a % x, a % y
            if current_pair in freq:
                freq[current_pair] += 1
            else:
                freq[current_pair] = 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` will be an empty list, `rx` will be the last calculated value of (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` will be the last calculated value of a % y, `count` will be the sum of `freq[rx, ry]` for all pairs where `rx` and `ry` match any previously seen pairs, `current_pair` will be the last calculated pair of (a % x, a % y), and `results` will contain the final value of `count`. The dictionary `freq` will store the frequency of each unique (a % x, a % y) pair seen throughout the loop.
    return results
    #The program returns the final value of `count`, which represents the sum of frequencies of all unique (a % x, a % y) pairs seen throughout the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array). The function returns the final value of count, which represents the sum of frequencies of all unique (a % x, a % y) pairs seen throughout the loop.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the final value of `count`, which represents the sum of frequencies of all unique (a % x, a % y) pairs seen throughout the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
