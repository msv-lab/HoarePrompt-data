Postcondition: `arr` is the fifth element of the next `test_case` and contains at least one element; `a` is the value of `arr`; `rx` is ((-a % x + x) % x); `ry` is a % y; `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y); `freq[current_pair]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `current_pair` is already present in `freq`.
