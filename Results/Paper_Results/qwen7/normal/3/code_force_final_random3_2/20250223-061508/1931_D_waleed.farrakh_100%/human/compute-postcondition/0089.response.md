Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are test cases to process. This means the loop will execute again if there are more test cases available.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `n`: This is the number of test cases. Since we are processing one test case per iteration, `n` will be decremented by 1 after each iteration.
   - `x` and `y`: These remain unchanged within the loop unless modified explicitly, but since they are constants for each test case, they stay the same.
   - `arr`: This is the array for the current test case. After processing all elements in the current `arr`, it will be ready for the next test case.
   - `test_cases`: This is the list of all test cases. After processing the current test case, we move to the next one.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `n` will be decremented by 1 because we have processed one test case.
- `x` and `y` remain the same.
- `arr` will be the next test case's array.
- `test_cases` will be the remaining list of test cases.

State: **`n` is decremented by 1, `x` remains the same, `y` remains the same, `arr` is the next test case's array, `test_cases` is the remaining list of test cases**.
