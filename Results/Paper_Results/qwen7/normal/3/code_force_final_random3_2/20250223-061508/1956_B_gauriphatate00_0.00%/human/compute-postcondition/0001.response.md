Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and appears at most twice in the list, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from `sys.stdin.read()`**.

The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read()`, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` is not affected by this operation.
