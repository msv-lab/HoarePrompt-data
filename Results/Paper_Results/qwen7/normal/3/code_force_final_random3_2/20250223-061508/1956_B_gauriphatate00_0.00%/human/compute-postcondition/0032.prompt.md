Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by the total length of all lists `a` (which is 3 * n), plus 3 (for the increments and the initial value of `t`); `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended three times, with each `n` and corresponding `a` being derived from the slices of `data` as per the loop's logic; `n` is the last integer obtained from `data[idx]`, and `a` is the list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` should still be greater than 0, `idx` will point to the position right after the last processed list `a`, `results` will contain the results of applying `func_1(n, a)` three times, and `n` and `a` will be set based on the final iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` must contain at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` must contain at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` must contain at least one element




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
