Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, followed by `t` groups of data. Each group contains an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each group, it calls `func_1(n, a)` three times, collects the results, and prints them. The function does not return any value but modifies a list `results` to store the output of `func_1` and prints the contents of `results` after processing all groups.**
