Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `result` and `results`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the `results` list.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: The state given is that `results` must contain at least one element.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element.
   - The variable `result` will be set to the next element in the `results` list during each iteration, but its value does not affect the loop condition directly.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `results` contains at least one element, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`results` must contain at least one element**
