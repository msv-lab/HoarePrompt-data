Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of points you can get in the described card game scenario. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the minimum between the number of pairs of identical cards in your hand (`pairs`) and half the number of cards you have (`n // 2`). This is because Nene will always try to maximize her score while minimizing yours, and having pairs of identical cards means Nene can block your points effectively. Thus, the maximum number of points you can get is limited by the number of such pairs.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It correctly handles the reading of multiple test cases and outputs the results for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the functions are correctly designed to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
