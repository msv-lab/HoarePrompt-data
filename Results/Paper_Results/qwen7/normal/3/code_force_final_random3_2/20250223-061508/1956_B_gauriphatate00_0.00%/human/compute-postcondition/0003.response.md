Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and appears at most twice in the list, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from `sys.stdin.read()`**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value from `data` at index `idx` to the variable `t`. Since `idx` was initially 0, it now becomes 1 after the assignment. The value of `t` is the integer obtained from `data[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
