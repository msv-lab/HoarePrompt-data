Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 2 * n, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx]` to `n` after converting it to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
