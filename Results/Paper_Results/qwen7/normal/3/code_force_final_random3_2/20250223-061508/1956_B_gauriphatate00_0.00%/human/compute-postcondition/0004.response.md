Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and appears at most twice in the list, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from `sys.stdin.read()`**.

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `data` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the executed line of code.
