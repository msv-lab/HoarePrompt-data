Output State: `t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 3 * n + 2; `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration of the loop; `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]` just before the last iteration, and `a` is updated to be the map of integers from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n` just before the last iteration.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` will still be greater than 0 (as long as the loop condition was met for all iterations), `idx` will be increased by 3 * n + 2 (since each iteration increments `idx` by n + 1), `results` will contain the cumulative results of applying `func_1(n, a)` for each of the t iterations, `n` will hold the value of `data[idx]` right before the last iteration, and `a` will be the list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` just before the last iteration.
