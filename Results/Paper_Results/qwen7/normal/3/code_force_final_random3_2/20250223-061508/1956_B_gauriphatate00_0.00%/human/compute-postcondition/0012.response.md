Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t > 0`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `idx` is increased by `2 * n`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]`.
   - `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since it was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be greater than 0 unless the loop body changes its value. However, no such change is mentioned, so we assume `t` remains greater than 0.
   - `idx` will be increased by `2 * n` again.
   - `a` will be a new list of integers obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]`.
   - `results` will have a new value appended to it, which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` must still be greater than 0.
   - `idx` will be increased by `2 * n` again.
   - `a` will be updated based on the new value of `idx`.
   - `results` will have a new value appended to it.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 2 * n, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended**.
