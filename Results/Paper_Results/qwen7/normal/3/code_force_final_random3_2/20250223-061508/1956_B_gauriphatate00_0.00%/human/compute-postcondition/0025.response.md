Output State: `t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by the total length of all lists `a` (which is 3 * n), plus 3 (for the increments and the initial value of `t`); `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended three times, with each `n` and corresponding `a` being derived from the slices of `data` as per the loop's logic; `n` is the last integer obtained from `data[idx]`, and `a` is the list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` should still be greater than 0, `idx` will point to the position right after the last processed list `a`, `results` will contain the results of applying `func_1(n, a)` three times, and `n` and `a` will be set based on the final iteration of the loop.
