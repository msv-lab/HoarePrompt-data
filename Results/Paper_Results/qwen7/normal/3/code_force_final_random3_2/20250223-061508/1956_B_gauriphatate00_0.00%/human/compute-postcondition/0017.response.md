Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 3 * n + 1, `results` is a list to which the return value of `func_1(n, a)` has been appended, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`, and `a` is updated to be the map of integers from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n`.**

Explanation: The code appends the return value of `func_1(n, a)` to the `results` list. The values of `t`, `idx`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged except that `idx` is increased by `3 * n + 1`. The `results` list now includes the return value of `func_1(n, a)`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and that `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and of length `n` remains valid.
