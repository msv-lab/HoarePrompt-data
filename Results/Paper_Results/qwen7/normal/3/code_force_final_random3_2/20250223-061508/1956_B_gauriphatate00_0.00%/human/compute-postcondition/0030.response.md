Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `result` and the iterable `results`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `results`. At the end of the previous iteration, it was stated that `results` must contain at least one element.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine any specific changes to `result` itself; however, we need to ensure that `results` still contains at least one element.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `results` must still contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` must contain at least one element**
