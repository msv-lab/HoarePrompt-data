The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of cards in your hand, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive. The function returns the minimum value between the number of pairs (integers with a count of exactly 2) found in the list `a` and half the number of cards in your hand (`n // 2`).
