Postcondition: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', with an additional element appended based on the condition. If `clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, then an additional 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. `i` is `test_cases`.**
