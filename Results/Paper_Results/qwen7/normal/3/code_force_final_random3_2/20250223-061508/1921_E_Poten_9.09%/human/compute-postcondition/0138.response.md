Postcondition: `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user; `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Bob' based on the condition that if `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, `answers` is set to ['Draw'], otherwise `answers` is set to ['Bob'].
