The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `answers`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over each element in the `answers` list. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing at least one of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', and `j` is the first element of the `answers` list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the second element of the `answers` list, and the `answers` list must still contain at least one of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw'.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing at least one of the strings 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', `j` is the second element of the `answers` list**
