Postcondition: `test_cases` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the first element of `clues` is not 1, and the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`. Additionally, the current value of `clues[2]` is even and the current value of `clues[4]` is even, or the current value of `clues[2]` is odd and the current value of `clues[4]` is odd. The fourth element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The decision to append 'Draw' or 'Bob' to `answers` depends on the following conditions:
- If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob'.
- If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, the decision is based on the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` being greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. If true, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw'; otherwise, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob'.
