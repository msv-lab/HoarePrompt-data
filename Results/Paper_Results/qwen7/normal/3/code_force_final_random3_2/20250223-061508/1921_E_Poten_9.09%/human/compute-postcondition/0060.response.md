Postcondition: `test_cases` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `answers` is either ['Draw'] or a list containing 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the first element of `clues` is not 1, and the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`. Additionally, the current value of `clues[2]` is even and the current value of `clues[4]` is even, or the current value of `clues[2]` is odd and the current value of `clues[4]` is odd. The fourth element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the current value of `clues[3]` is less than or equal to the current value of `clues[5]`. The decision to append 'Draw' or 'Bob' to `answers` depends on whether the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`.
