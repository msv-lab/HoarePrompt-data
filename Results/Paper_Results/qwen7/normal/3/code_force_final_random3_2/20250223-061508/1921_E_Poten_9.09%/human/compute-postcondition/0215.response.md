Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing the elements 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' with an additional 'Draw' appended, `i` is `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Draw')` appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The other variables (`clues` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
