Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user; `answers` is a list containing 'Draw'**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The initial state of `clues` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `clues` is still a list of integers entered by the user, and `answers` now contains the string `'Draw'`.
