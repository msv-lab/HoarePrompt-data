Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' with 'Alice' appended, `i` is `test_cases`**.

This means that the `answers` list has had 'Alice' appended to it, while the `clues` list and the variable `i` (which is equal to `test_cases`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
