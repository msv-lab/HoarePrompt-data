Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the outcome of the game. Specifically, the program does not handle all possible cases correctly. Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the following test case:
```
6 5 2 2 5 3
```
- Alice starts at (2, 2).
- Bob starts at (5, 3).

According to the rules, Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left, and Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left. Let's analyze the possible outcomes:

1. **Alice's First Move**: Alice can move to (3, 2), (3, 1), or (3, 3).
2. **Bob's First Move**: Bob can move to (4, 3), (4, 2), or (4, 4).

The program incorrectly determines the outcome based on certain conditions, such as the parity of the coordinates and the relative positions of Alice and Bob. However, the program does not fully account for all possible moves and their outcomes.

For instance, if Alice moves to (3, 2) and Bob moves to (4, 3), the game continues, and the program should correctly determine the winner based on the optimal moves of both players. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, leading to an incorrect outcome.
