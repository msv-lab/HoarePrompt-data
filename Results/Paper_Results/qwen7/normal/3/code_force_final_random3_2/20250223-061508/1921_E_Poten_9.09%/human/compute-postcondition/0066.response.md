Postcondition: **`test_cases` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the first element of `clues` is not 1, and the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`. Additionally, the current value of `clues[2]` is even and the current value of `clues[4]` is even, or the current value of `clues[2]` is odd and the current value of `clues[4]` is odd. The fourth element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the decision to append 'Draw' or 'Bob' to `answers` is based on the following conditions:**
- If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` is set to ['Bob'].
- If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` contains 'Draw'.
- If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, `answers` contains 'Bob'.
- If `clues[3] >= clues[5]` and the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, `answers` contains 'Bob'.
- If none of the above conditions are met, `answers` contains 'Draw'.
