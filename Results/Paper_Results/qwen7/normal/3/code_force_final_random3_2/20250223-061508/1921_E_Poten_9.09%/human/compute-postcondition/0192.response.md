Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' with an additional 'Draw' appended, `i` is `test_cases`**.

This means that the `answers` list has had an additional element `'Draw'` appended to it, while the `clues` list and the value of `i` (which is `test_cases`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
