Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), and \(y_b\). For each test case, it determines whether Alice, Bob, or neither can win based on specific conditions related to these integers. The function appends the result ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') to a list for each test case and prints the results in the order they were processed. The final output is a list of outcomes for all test cases.**
