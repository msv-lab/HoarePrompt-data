Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user; `answers` is a list containing 'Bob'**.

The code appends the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. Since `clues` was the only predefined list and no changes were made to it, its state remains unchanged. The new list `answers` now contains the string `'Bob'`.
