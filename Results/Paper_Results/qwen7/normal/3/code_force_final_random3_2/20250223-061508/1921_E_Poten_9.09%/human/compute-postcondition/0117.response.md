Postcondition: **`test_cases` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw' or ['Alice'], `i` is 0 or 1, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the first element of `clues` is not 1, the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the current value of `clues[3]` is less than or equal to the current value of `clues[5]`.**

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes after the if-else block executes. If the condition in the if statement is true, `answers` will contain 'Draw' and `i` will be 1. Otherwise, `answers` will contain ['Alice'] and `i` will remain 0. The other variables (`test_cases`, `clues`) retain their initial conditions specified in the precondition.
