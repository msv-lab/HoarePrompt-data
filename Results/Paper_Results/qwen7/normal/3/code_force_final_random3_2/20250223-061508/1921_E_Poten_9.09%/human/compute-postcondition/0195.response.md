Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` is a list containing the elements 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' with an additional 'Draw' appended, `i` is `test_cases`.**

The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The initial state of `clues` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, `clues` is still a list of integers entered by the user, `answers` now contains the original elements plus an additional `'Draw'`, and `i` is still equal to `test_cases`.
