Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `y = x // 2` assigns the value of `x // 2` to the variable `y`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `y` is now assigned the value of `x` divided by 2 using integer division.
