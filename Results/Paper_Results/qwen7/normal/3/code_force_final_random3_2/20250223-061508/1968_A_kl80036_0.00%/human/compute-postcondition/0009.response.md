Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`, `x` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `x`. The value of `t`, `i`, and `y` remains unchanged from their initial state. The new value of `x` is the integer input provided by the user.
