Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This means `t` can take any integer value between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `i` is 0. So, `i = 0`.
   - `x` is an input integer. Let's denote this input as `x_input`.
   - `y` is calculated as `x // 2`, where `//` denotes integer division.

2. **Calculation of `y`**:
   - Since `y = x // 2`, `y` will be the integer part of `x_input / 2`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(y)`, which will print the value of `y`.

Given the initial state, the value of `y` depends on the input integer `x_input`. Since the exact value of `x_input` is not specified, we can only describe `y` in terms of `x_input`.

Output: **[x_input // 2]**
