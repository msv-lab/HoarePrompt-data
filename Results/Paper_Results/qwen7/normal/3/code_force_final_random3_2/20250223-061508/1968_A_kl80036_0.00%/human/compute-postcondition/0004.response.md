Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input()))`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is `x // 2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run for `int(input())` iterations. Since `i` starts at 0, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented to 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - The value of `i` must be 1 for the loop to execute again.
   - The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`**.
