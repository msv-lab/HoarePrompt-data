Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x // 2` to `y`. Here, `//` denotes integer division, which means the result is the quotient of `x` divided by 2, discarding any remainder. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
