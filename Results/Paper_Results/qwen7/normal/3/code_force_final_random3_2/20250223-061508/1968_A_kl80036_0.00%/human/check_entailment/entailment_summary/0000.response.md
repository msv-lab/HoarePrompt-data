Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by simply printing `x // 2` for each test case. However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). The goal is to find a \(y\) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized, but the program's current logic only divides \(x\) by 2, which does not guarantee the maximum value.

To illustrate why this might be incorrect, consider the following examples:

- For \(x = 10\), the program outputs \(y = 5\). But \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\). Checking other possible values, we see that \(\gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 12\), which is greater.
- For \(x = 21\), the program outputs \(y = 10\). But \(\gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 13\). Checking other possible values, we see that \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 30\), which is greater.

Thus, the program does not always find the optimal \(y\) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Correctness: **False**
