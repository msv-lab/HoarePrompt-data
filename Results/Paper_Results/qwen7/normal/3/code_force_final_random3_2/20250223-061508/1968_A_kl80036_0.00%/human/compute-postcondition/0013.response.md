Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from `i` in `range(int(input()))`, and `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to \(n-1\)), `x` is an input integer, and `y` is `x // 2` for the last input value of `x`.

In this final state, the loop has executed 1000 times (from `i=0` to `i=999`). The variable `t` remains within its initial constraint, `i` is set to 999 as it is the last iteration of the loop, `x` holds the value of the last input integer processed by the loop, and `y` is the result of dividing `x` by 2 using integer division.
