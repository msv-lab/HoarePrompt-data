Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `i` remains 0. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `x` as an input integer, while keeping the original conditions for `t` and the value of `i`.
