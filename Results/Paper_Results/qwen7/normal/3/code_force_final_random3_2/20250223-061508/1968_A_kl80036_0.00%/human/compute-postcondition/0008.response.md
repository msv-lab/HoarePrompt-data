Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input()))`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `y` is `x // 2`
   - `x` is reassigned to an input integer

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.
   - Let's assume the user inputs a value for `int(input())`. Let's denote this new input value as `new_input_value`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value (which was 1). Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < new_input_value`. So, `i` must be less than `new_input_value`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` remains the same, as it is not involved in the loop head.
- `i` is updated to 2.
- `x` is still an input integer, but it hasn't been reassigned yet.
- `y` is still `x // 2`, but it hasn't been recalculated yet.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`**
