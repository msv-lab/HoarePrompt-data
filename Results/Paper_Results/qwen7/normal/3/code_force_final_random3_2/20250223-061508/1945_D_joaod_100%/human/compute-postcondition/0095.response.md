Output State: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `best` is total + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` remains `sys.float_info.max`, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `total` is the minimum cumulative cost considering either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` based on which is smaller and then increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `v` is an integer within the bounds of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` and is decreased by 1.**

In more detail, the `total` variable is updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
