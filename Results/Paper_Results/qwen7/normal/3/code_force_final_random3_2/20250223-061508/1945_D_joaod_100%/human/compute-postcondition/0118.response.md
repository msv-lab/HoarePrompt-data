Output State: **`na_frente` is an integer obtained from the first number input, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the second number input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent input split and converted to integers.**

The code `custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` remain unchanged.
