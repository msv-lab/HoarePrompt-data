Output State: **`total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`, `na_frente` remains its initial value, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `best` is unchanged if neither branch updates it, otherwise `best` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final`, or to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `v > pos_final`.**

Explanation: The code updates `total` by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. The other variables (`na_frente`, `v`, and `best`) remain unchanged from their initial values unless they are updated by another part of the code. The condition for updating `best` remains the same, considering the new value of `total`.
