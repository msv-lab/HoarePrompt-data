Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `v`.

2. **Determine the Range of `v`:**
   The loop starts with `v = na_frente` and decrements `v` until it reaches `-1`. 

3. **Understand the Postcondition:**
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged.
   - `custo_pra_passar_b` remains unchanged.
   - `best` is updated based on the condition `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
   - `cases` remains unchanged.
   - `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `na_frente` is a non-negative integer.
   - `total` is the minimum cumulative cost.
   - `v` is an integer within the bounds of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop decrements `v` from `na_frente` to `-1`, the next value of `v` will be `v - 1`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged as per the postcondition.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged.
- `custo_pra_passar_b` remains unchanged.
- `best` remains unchanged (as it is not updated in the loop).
- `cases` remains unchanged.
- `pos_final` remains unchanged (as it is not updated in the loop).
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged.
- `c` remains 0.
- `na_frente` remains unchanged.
- `total` remains unchanged.
- `v` decreases by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `best` is set to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` remains `sys.float_info.max`, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `total` is the minimum cumulative cost considering either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` based on which is smaller, and `v` is an integer within the bounds of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` and is decreased by 1.**
