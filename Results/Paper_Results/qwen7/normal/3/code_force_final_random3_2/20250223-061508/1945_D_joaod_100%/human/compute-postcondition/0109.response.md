Output State: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `best` is the minimum cumulative cost considering either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` based on which is smaller, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is an integer within the bounds of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` and is increased by 1, `total` is the original value of `total` plus `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In this output state, the `total` variable has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
