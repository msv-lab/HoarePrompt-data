Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `x` which iterates over the values of `cnt.values()`. Therefore, the only variable directly controlled by the loop head is `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more values in `cnt.values()` to iterate over.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: The state given is that `ans` is increased by `x // 4`. This means that `ans` has been updated based on the value of `x` from the previous iteration.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ans` was updated in the previous iteration, it does not need to be modified for the next iteration.
   - The variable `x` will take the next value from `cnt.values()` for the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be set to the next value from `cnt.values()`. There is no specific requirement mentioned for `ans` to change for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `x` is now the next value from `cnt.values()`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is increased by the previous value of `x` // 4, `x` is the next value from `cnt.values()`**
