Based on the initial state provided:

- The dictionary `cnt` contains the count of each unique element in the list `a`.
- The variable `ans` remains 0.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(ans)
```

Since `ans` is explicitly stated to remain 0, the print statement will output the value of `ans`.

Output: **0**
