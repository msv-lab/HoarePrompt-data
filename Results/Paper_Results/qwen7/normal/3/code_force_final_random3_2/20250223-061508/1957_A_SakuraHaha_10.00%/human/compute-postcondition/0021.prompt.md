You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `a` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in the list `a`.
    #
    #This final output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the dictionary `cnt` contains the count of each unique element in the list `a`. The variable `ans` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop. The values of `t` and `n` also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: The dictionary `cnt` contains the count of each unique element in the list `a`, and the variable `ans` remains 0.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t, n, and the list of integers a_i.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
