Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not handle the input reading and processing correctly.
2. The program reads `t` but does not process multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.
3. The function `func_1()` processes only one test case, but the main part of the program calls this function without handling multiple test cases.
4. The logic inside `func_1()` calculates the number of sides of polygons that can be formed using the sticks, but it does not account for the fact that no stick can be used in more than one polygon.
5. The variable `ans` should be reset to 0 at the beginning of each test case, but it is not being reset.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
