Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `N` inclusive, as specified by `range(N + 1)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` must be at least 0.

2. **Determine the next value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `N`.
   - Given that `N` must be at least 0, and `i` is now 2, the loop will continue if `N` is at least 2.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `N` must still be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Other states remain unchanged:**
   - `s` remains 1.
   - `arr` remains containing the tuples `(1, 0, num)` and `(2, 1, num)` where `num` is equal to `nums[i]`.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `N` must be at least 2, `s` is 1, and `arr` contains the tuples `(1, 0, num)` and `(2, 1, num)` where `num` is equal to `nums[2]`**.
