Output State: **i is N, s is N, e is N, arr contains tuples of the form (1 + N, j, nums[j]) for each index j from 0 to N inclusive, nums is a list with at least N + 1 elements, l and r are integers from the input split, eli is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple (l, 0, 0) in the sorted list arr, and _ is the loop counter which is N.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `N`, as the loop runs `N + 1` times and starts from `0`. The variable `s` will also be equal to `N`, as it is set to `N` when the loop finishes and no further changes are made to it within the loop. Similarly, `e` will be equal to `N` for the same reason. The list `arr` will contain tuples of the form `(1 + N, j, nums[j])` for each index `j` from `0` to `N` inclusive, as the loop appends such tuples to `arr` in each iteration. The variable `nums` remains unchanged throughout the loop. The variables `l` and `r` are input values from the split operation and do not change during the loop. The variable `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, and `_` is the loop counter which is `N` after all iterations.
