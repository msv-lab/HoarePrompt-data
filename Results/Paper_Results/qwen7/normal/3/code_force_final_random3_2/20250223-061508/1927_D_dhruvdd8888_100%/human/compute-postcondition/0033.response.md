Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `l` and `r`. The values of `i`, `s`, `arr`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
