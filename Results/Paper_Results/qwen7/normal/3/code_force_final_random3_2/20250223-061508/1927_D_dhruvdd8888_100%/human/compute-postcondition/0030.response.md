Output State: The loop will execute exactly `N + 1` times, where `N` is the integer input from stdin. After all iterations, the variable `i` will be `N`, `s` will be equal to `N`, and `arr` will contain tuples of the form `(1 + s, j, num)` for each index `j` from `0` to `N` inclusive, where `num` is the value of `nums[j]`. The value of `num` will be the last element of `nums` since the loop continues until `i` reaches `N` and appends the final tuple with `i` being `N`.
