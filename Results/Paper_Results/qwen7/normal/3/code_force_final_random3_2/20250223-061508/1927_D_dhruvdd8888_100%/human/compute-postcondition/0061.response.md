Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `arr` is an updated list, `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`**.

The code reads two integers from the input and splits them into a tuple, assigning the first integer to `l` and the second integer to `r`. The other variables (`i`, `s`, `e`, `arr`, `nums`, `eli`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
