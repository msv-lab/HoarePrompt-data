Output State: **`i` is 0, `N` must be at least 0, the value of `nums[i]` is not equal to `num', `arr` contains the tuple `(1 + s, 0, num)`**.

This means that the list `arr` has been appended with a new tuple `(1 + s, 0, num)`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0, `N` remains unchanged (still must be at least 0), and `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`.
