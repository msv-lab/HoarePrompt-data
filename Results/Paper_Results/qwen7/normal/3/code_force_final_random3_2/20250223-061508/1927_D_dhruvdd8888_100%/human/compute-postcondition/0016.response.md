Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(N + 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < N + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `N` must be at least 0
   - `nums[i]` is now equal to `num`
   - `s` is 0
   - `arr` contains the tuple `(1 + s, 0, num)`

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `N` must be at least 0, the condition `i < N + 1` will be true for the next iteration if `N` remains at least 0.
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `nums[i]` (which is `nums[1]`) will be updated to `num`.
   - `s` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `arr` will contain the tuple `(1 + s, 0, num)`, which remains `(1, 0, num)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `N` must be at least 0, the value of `nums[i]` is now equal to `num`, `s` is 0, and `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 0, num)`**.
