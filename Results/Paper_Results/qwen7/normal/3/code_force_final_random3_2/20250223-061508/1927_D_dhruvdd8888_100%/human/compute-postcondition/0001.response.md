Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `N` is an integer input from stdin.**

The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input (which is set to `sys.stdin.readline`) and assigns it to the variable `N`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `q`) remain unchanged.
