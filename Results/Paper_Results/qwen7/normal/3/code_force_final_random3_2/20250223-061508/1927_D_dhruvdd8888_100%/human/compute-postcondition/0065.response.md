Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.
- `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.
- `arr` is an updated list.
- `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements.
- `l` is an integer from the input split.
- `r` is an integer from the input split.
- `eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
- `s` is now the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.
- `e` is now the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.

The print statement is:
```python
print(s - 1, s)
```

Given the description, `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index. Since no specific value for `s` is provided, we cannot determine its exact numerical value. However, we know that `s` is derived from the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index in the list `arr`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **s - 1, s** (where `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index).
