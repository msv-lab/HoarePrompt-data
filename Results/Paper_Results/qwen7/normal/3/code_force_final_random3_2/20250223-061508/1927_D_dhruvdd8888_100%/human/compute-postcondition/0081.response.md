Based on the initial state provided:

- `eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
- `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.
- `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.
- `_` is 2.
- `l` is an integer from the input split.
- `r` is an integer from the input split.
- `s` is assigned the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.
- `e` is assigned the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.

The print statement is:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1 -1**
