Postcondition: **`eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `_` is 2, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `s` is assigned the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is assigned the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index. This holds true regardless of whether the condition `e < N or e < l` is met or not.**
