Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `N + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(N + 1):` will start with `i = 0` and continue until `i < N + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `N + 1` must be greater than 0. Since `N` is an integer input from stdin, we need to ensure that `N` is at least 0.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - The initial value of `i` will be 0 when the loop starts.
   - The value of `N` must be at least 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\).
- `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input with an additional element `-1` appended to it.
- `N` is an integer input from stdin.
- `s` is 0.
- `e` is 0.
- `num` is the first element of `nums`.
- `arr` is an empty list.

The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `N + 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `N` is at least 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `N` must be at least 0**
