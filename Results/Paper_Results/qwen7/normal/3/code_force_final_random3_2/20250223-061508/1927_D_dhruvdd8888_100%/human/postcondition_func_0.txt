The function processes a list of integers `nums` and handles a series of queries. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, it determines and prints a pair of indices based on the segments of `nums` identified during the initial pass through the list. If no valid segment is found, it prints `-1 -1`. The function does not return any value but modifies and uses predefined global variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q`.
