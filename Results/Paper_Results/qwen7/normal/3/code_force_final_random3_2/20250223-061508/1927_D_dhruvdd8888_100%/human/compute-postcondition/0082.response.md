Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
   - `s` is the start value of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index.
   - `e` is the end value of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `l` is an integer from the input split.
   - `r` is an integer from the input split.
   - `s` is assigned the start value of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index.
   - `e` is assigned the end value of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(s, e + 1)
   ```

Given the initial state, we know that:
- `s` and `e` are derived from the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index in the sorted list `arr`.

Therefore, when the `print` statement is executed, it will print the values of `s` and `e + 1`.

Since the exact values of `s` and `e` depend on the contents of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index in `arr`, we can express the output in terms of these values.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s and e are the start and end values of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index in the sorted list arr)**
