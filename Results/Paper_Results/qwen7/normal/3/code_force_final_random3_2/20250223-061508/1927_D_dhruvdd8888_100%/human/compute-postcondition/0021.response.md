Output State: **`i` is 1, `N` must be at least 0, `s` is 1, and `arr` contains the tuples `(1, 0, num)` and `(2, 1, num); num` is equal to `nums[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. Since `i` is 1, `num` now holds the value of `nums[1]`. All other variables (`N`, `s`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
