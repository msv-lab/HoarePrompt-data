### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Structure**:
   - The function reads the input values `N`, `nums`, and `q`.
   - It then processes `nums` to create a list of ranges where each range contains consecutive identical numbers.
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate range within the processed list `arr`.

2. **Processing Input and Creating Ranges**:
   - The code correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` and stores them in `arr` as tuples `(start_index + 1, end_index, value)`.
   - This step ensures that for any segment `[l, r]`, there will be a range in `arr` that starts before or at `l` and ends after or at `r`.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the code uses `bisect_left` to find the first range in `arr` that starts at or before `l`.
   - It then checks if this range starts before `l` and ends after `r` to determine if a valid pair `(i, j)` exists.
   - The logic handles edge cases where no valid pair exists or where the range boundaries do not overlap with the query range.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles cases where the range starts before `l` but ends after `r` (prints `-1, -1`).
   - It also handles cases where the range starts before `l` and ends within `r` (prints the valid pair).
   - The code correctly handles cases where the range starts after `l` and ends after `r` (prints `-1, -1`).

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic is sound and correctly implements the problem requirements.
   - The use of `bisect_left` efficiently finds the relevant range for each query, and the subsequent checks ensure correctness.
