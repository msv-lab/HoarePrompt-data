Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `s` is the start value of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index.
- `e` is the end value of the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index.
- `arr` is an empty list.
- `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements.
- `l` is an integer from the input split.
- `r` is an integer from the input split.
- `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
- `e` is less than `N` and `e` is less than `l`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the variables `s` and `e`:

- Since `arr` is an empty list, there are no tuples in `arr` initially.
- Therefore, `eli` would be the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted if `arr` were not empty. However, since `arr` is empty, `eli` is effectively 0 because it would be the first position if we were to insert `(l, 0, 0)` into an empty list.
- `LA` is not explicitly defined, but it doesn't matter since `eli` itself is 0. Thus, `min(eli, LA)` is 0.
- The tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index (which is 0) does not exist because `arr` is empty, so `s` and `e` cannot be determined from this list.

However, since the problem specifies that `s` and `e` are derived from the tuple at the `min(eli, LA)` index, and there is no such tuple due to `arr` being empty, we need to consider the logical defaults or assumptions.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, it seems reasonable to assume that `s` and `e` might default to some initial values, but since they are derived from non-existent tuples, we can infer that `s` and `e` are not meaningful in this context.

Therefore, the print statement `print(s, e + 1)` will print default or undefined values for `s` and `e + 1`.

Output: **0, 1** (assuming `s` and `e` default to 0, and `e + 1` is 1)
