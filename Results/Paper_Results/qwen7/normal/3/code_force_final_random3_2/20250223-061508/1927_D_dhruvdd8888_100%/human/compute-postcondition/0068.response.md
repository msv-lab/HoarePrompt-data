Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.
- `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.
- `arr` is an updated list.
- `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements.
- `l` is an integer from the input split.
- `r` is an integer from the input split.
- `eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
- `s` is now the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.
- `e` is now the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.

The `print(s, e + 1)` statement will print the start value `s` and the end value `e + 1` of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index.

Since `s` and `e` are explicitly defined as the start and end values of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, we can directly use these values in the output.

Output: **s, e + 1**
