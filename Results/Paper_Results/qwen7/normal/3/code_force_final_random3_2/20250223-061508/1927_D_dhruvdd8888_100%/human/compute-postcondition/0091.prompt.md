You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute exactly `N + 1` times, where `N` is the integer input from stdin. After all iterations, the variable `i` will be `N`, `s` will be equal to `N`, and `arr` will contain tuples of the form `(1 + s, j, num)` for each index `j` from `0` to `N` inclusive, where `num` is the value of `nums[j]`. The value of `num` will be the last element of `nums` since the loop continues until `i` reaches `N` and appends the final tuple with `i` being `N`.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: i is N, s is N, e is N, arr contains tuples of the form (1 + N, j, nums[j]) for each index j from 0 to N inclusive, nums is a list with at least N + 1 elements, l and r are integers from the input split, eli is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple (l, 0, 0) in the sorted list arr, and _ is the loop counter which is N.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on predefined variables t, n, a, and q. It processes q queries, each defined by two integers l and r, and returns the result based on the elements in list a from index l to r (inclusive).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
