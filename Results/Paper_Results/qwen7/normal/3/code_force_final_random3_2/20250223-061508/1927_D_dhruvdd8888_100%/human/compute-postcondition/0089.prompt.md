Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will execute exactly N + 1 times, where N is the integer input from stdin. After all iterations, the variable i will be N, s will be equal to N, and arr will contain tuples of the form (1 + s, j, num) for each index j from 0 to N inclusive, where num is the value of nums[j]. The value of num will be the last element of nums since the loop continues until i reaches N and appends the final tuple with i being N. LA is the length of arr minus one.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1 or s > r:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N or e < l:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `arr` is an empty list, `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`. If `s` is greater than `r` or `s` is less than or equal to `r`, `s` remains unchanged. If `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, then `e` is greater than or equal to `r`; otherwise, either `e` is less than `N` and `e` is less than `l`, or `e` is greater than or equal to `N` and `e` is greater than or equal to `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `arr` is an updated list, `nums` is a list with at least `N + 1` elements, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is now the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is now the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index. In all cases, the values of `i`, `s`, `e`, `arr`, `nums`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, and `e` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `eli` is the updated index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`, `s` is the start value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `e` is the end value of the tuple at the min(eli, LA) index, `_` is 2, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, and after executing the if-else block, `s` and `e` retain their assignments from the min(eli, LA) index regardless of the condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
