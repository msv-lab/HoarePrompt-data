Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program aims to find the number of '0's between the first and last '1' in the string `arr`. However, the goal is to minimize the number of operations required to move all chips into a single contiguous block. Counting the '0's between the first and last '1' does not directly give the minimum number of operations needed.

2. **Misinterpretation of Operations**: The program does not simulate the actual operations of moving chips to the closest free cell to the left. Instead, it simply counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, which is not equivalent to the number of operations required.

3. **No Simulation of Moves**: The program does not simulate the process of moving chips step-by-step, which is necessary to ensure the minimum number of operations is calculated accurately.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
