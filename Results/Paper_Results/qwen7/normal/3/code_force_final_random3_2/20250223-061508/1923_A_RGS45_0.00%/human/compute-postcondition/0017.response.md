Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code converts the input, which was originally an integer (`n`), into a string and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as an input integer, while `arr` now holds the string representation of the input previously held by `n`.
