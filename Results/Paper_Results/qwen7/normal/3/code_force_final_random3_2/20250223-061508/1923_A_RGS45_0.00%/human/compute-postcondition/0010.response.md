Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (considering the reversed string), `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`, `n` is updated to an input integer**.

Explanation: The code replaces the current value of `arr` with a new string input from the user. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions, but their actual values depend on the new input string `arr`.
