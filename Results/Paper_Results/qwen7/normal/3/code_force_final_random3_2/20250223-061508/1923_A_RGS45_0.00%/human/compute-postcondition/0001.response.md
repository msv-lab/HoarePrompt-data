Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, which is a common practice when the value of the iterator is not needed within the loop body.
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `n` and the values of `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are unspecified but known to be either 0 or 1, with at least one being 1.

3. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute:**
   - Since the loop runs `t` times, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The values of `n` and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` do not affect whether the loop can execute; they are only relevant inside the loop body.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
