Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a new string input from the user.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found.
   - `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`, where `arr[::-1]` is the reverse of `arr`.
   - `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(z.count('0'))
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.
   - `z.count('0')` counts the number of '0's in the substring `z`.

Given the initial state, let's consider the possible values for `x` and `y`:
- If `1` is not found in `arr`, then `x = -1`.
- If `1` is not found in `arr[::-1]`, then `y = -1`.

However, since the problem does not specify the exact content of `arr`, we need to consider the general case where `1` is found in both `arr` and `arr[::-1]`.

Let's assume the following example for clarity:
- Suppose `arr = "10101"`.
- `x` would be 0 (index of the first '1').
- `y` would be 4 (index of the first '1' in the reversed string "10101").

Then, `z` would be `arr[x:n-y-1] = arr[0:5-4-1] = arr[0:0] = ""`.

Finally, `z.count('0')` would count the number of '0's in an empty string, which is 0.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **0**
