Output State: **The variable `t` will be equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, which is the initial value of `t`. For each iteration, `n` will be an input integer, `arr` will be a string input from the user, `x` will be the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` (or -1 if '1' is not found), `y` will be the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (or -1 if '1' is not found), and `z` will be a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`. After all iterations, the final values of `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will reflect the total number of iterations that occurred. The values of `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be determined based on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
