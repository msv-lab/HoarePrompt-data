Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (considering the reversed string).**

Explanation: The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`. If '1' is found, `y` will be the index of this character in the reversed string, otherwise, it will be `-1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
