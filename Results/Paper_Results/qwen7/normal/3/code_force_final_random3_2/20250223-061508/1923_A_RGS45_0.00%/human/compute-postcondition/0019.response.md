Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found.**

The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` reverses the string `arr` and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' from the reversed string. This gives us the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the original string `arr`. If '1' is not found, both `x` and `y` will be -1.
