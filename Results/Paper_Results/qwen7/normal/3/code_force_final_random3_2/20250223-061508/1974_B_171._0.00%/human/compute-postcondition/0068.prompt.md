Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `decoded` is an empty list, `mapping` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for char in encoded:
    if char in mapping:
        decoded.append(mapping[char])
    else:
        for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
            if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                mapping[chr(c)] = char
                break
        decoded.append(chr(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `decoded` is either a list containing one element `'mapping[char]'`, or an empty list. `mapping` is either an empty dictionary, or a dictionary containing all letters from 'a' to 'z' as keys, each mapped to the value 'a'. `encoded` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `decoded` is either a list containing one additional element `'mapping[char]'`, or it contains the character 'z'. `mapping` remains unchanged, `encoded` remains unchanged, and `char` is the next character in `encoded`. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` gets the new element. Otherwise, `c` is 97 (ord('a')), `decoded` contains 'z', `mapping` maps all letters from 'a' to 'z' to 'a', and `encoded` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `decoded` is a list and `mapping` remains unchanged. If `char` is in `mapping`, then `decoded` is extended by `'mapping[char]'`. If `char` is 'z', then `decoded` ends with 'z'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
