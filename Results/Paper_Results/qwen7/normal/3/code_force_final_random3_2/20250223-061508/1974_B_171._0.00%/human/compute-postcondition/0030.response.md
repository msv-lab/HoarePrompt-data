Output State: **`c` is 97, `mapping` is a dictionary with key 'a' and value `char`, the character corresponding to `c` is not in the values of `mapping`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a block of code prematurely. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that the `break` statement is part of, the only thing we know is that the execution is terminated at this point. Therefore, none of the variables are modified by this statement. The initial state remains unchanged.
