Output State: **`c` is 99; `mapping['c']` is assigned the value of `char'; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is initially set to 99, and `mapping[chr(99)]` (which is `mapping['c']`) is assigned the value of `char`. The `break` statement does not affect the values of `c` or `mapping['c']`, but it indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
