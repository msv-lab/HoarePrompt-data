Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):`. The variables involved here are `c`.

2. **Determine the Range of `c`**: The range function `range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)` generates values from the ASCII value of 'a' to the ASCII value of 'z'. This means `c` will take on each value from 97 (ASCII for 'a') to 122 (ASCII for 'z').

3. **Initial State**: 
   - `decoded` is an empty list.
   - `mapping` is an empty dictionary.
   - `char` is not in `mapping`.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are more characters in the range from 'a' to 'z' to iterate over. Since the range is fixed and known, the loop will always execute if the range is valid.

5. **Adjusting the States**: 
   - The variable `c` will start from the ASCII value of 'a' (97) and increment until it reaches the ASCII value of 'z' (122). Therefore, before the loop starts, `c` should be set to the starting value of the range, which is 97 (the ASCII value of 'a').

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `c` should be set to the starting value of the range, which is 97 (the ASCII value of 'a').

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`decoded` is an empty list, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 97**.
