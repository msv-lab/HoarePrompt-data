State: **`decoded` is an empty list, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `encoded` must have at least one character**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `char`, which is being iterated over from the `encoded` list.
2. For the loop to execute, the `encoded` list must contain at least one character. If `encoded` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. The variables `decoded` and `mapping` are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.
