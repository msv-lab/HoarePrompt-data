Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `decoded` is an empty list.
   - `mapping` is a dictionary.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - For each character `c` in this range, if `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` is updated with the key `chr(c)` and the value `'a'`.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since the loop has just completed an iteration, `c` would have been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `c`.
   - After the loop completes an iteration, `c` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `c` will be `ord('b')` (which is 98) if it was `ord('a')` (which is 97) in the previous iteration.

6. **Checking Dictionary Update**:
   - The dictionary `mapping` might have been updated based on the condition in the loop body.
   - However, since we don't know the exact value of `c` from the previous iteration, we can only say that if `chr(c-1)` (the previous character) was not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` was updated with `chr(c-1)` as the key and `'a'` as the value.

Given these points, let's state the modified state:

- `decoded` remains an empty list because the loop body does not modify it.
- `mapping` might have been updated, but we cannot specify the exact state without knowing the exact value of `c` from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`decoded` is an empty list, `mapping` is a dictionary that may have been updated with the key `chr(c-1)` and the value `'a'` if `chr(c-1)` was not already in the values of `mapping`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `c` from the previous iteration, we can only say that `c` will be `ord('b')` (98) in the next iteration.

So, the final state can be summarized as:

State: **`decoded` is an empty list, `mapping` is a dictionary that may have been updated with the key `chr(97)` (which is 'a') and the value `'a'` if `'a'` was not already in the values of `mapping`, and `c` is 98**.
