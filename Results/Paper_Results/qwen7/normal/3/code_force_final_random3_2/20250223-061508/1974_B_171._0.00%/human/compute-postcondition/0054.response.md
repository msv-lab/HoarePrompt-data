Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `c`, which iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `c` is within the specified range.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 'a'. This means that the loop has just started or has completed its first iteration.

4. **Check the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, no changes are made. However, since the loop body is not provided, we focus on the loop itself and the loop variables.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `c` should now be 'b'.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`c` is 'b'**
