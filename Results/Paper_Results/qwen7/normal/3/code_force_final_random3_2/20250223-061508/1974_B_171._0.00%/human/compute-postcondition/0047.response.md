Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `char`, `decoded`, `mapping`, and `encoded`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `encoded`. After each iteration, `char` is set to the next character in `encoded`.

3. **Postcondition analysis**:
   - `decoded` is updated based on whether `char` is in `mapping`.
   - If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` gets a new element `'mapping[char]'`.
   - If `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is set to 97 (`ord('a')`), `decoded` contains 'z', and `mapping` maps all letters from 'a' to 'z' to 'a'.
   - `mapping` and `encoded` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `decoded` is either a list containing one additional element `'mapping[char]'`, or it contains the character 'z'.
   - `mapping` remains unchanged.
   - `encoded` remains unchanged.
   - `char` is the next character in `encoded`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `char` is the next character in `encoded`, for the loop to continue, `encoded` must still contain characters.
   - Therefore, `char` will be the next character in `encoded`.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `char` is now the next character in `encoded`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`decoded` is either a list containing one additional element `'mapping[char]'`, or it contains the character 'z', `mapping` remains unchanged, `encoded` is a string with at least one character remaining, and `char` is the next character in `encoded`.**
