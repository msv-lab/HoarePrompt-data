Output State: **`j` is 0; `arr` is a list containing 1; `lex` is `lex - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `lex` was an input integer less than or equal to 26, the new value of `lex` is now one less than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.
