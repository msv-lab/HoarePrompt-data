Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is between 1 and 51, `arr` is [26, 1, 1]**.

Explanation: The code appends the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` is `[26, 1]` if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, or `[26, 26]` otherwise. In both cases, after appending `1`, the list `arr` becomes `[26, 1, 1]`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
