Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(2)`. The only variable here is `j`.

2. **Determine the current value of `j`**: Since the loop is iterating over `range(2)`, it means `j` takes values from 0 to 1. We need to determine the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Determine the value of `j` at the start of the next iteration**:
   - If `j` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - If `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, then the loop would have completed, and no further iterations would occur.

4. **Adjust the state based on the value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` can only be 0 or 1, and we need to consider the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1 if it was 0 previously.

Given that `j` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to adjust the states of `lex` or `arr` because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, then `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is greater than 26, then `arr` contains the element 26, and if `lex` is less than 52, `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` still contains the element 26.**
