Output State: `arr` is a list containing sorted elements starting with 1s followed by 26s, and ends with the value of `lex`, `k` is 2, `lex` is an integer.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (i.e., `k` goes from 0 to 2), the final value of `k` will be 2. The list `arr` and the value of `lex` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The loop simply prints characters based on the values in `arr` and increments `k` until it reaches 3, but does not alter `arr` or `lex`.
