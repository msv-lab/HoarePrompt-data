Output State: `arr` is a list containing sorted elements starting with 1s followed by 26s, and ends with the value of `lex`, `k` is 2, `lex` is an integer.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the final value of `k` will be 2. The list `arr` will contain elements that started with 1s and 26s based on the conditions within the loop, and it ends with the value of `lex`. The variable `lex` retains its final value from the last iteration of the loop. The other variables (`i`, `j`, and `cases`) are not relevant to the final output state since they are either used within the loop or reset in each iteration.
