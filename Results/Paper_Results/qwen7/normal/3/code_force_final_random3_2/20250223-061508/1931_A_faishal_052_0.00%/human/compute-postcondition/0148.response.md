Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list containing sorted elements starting with 1s followed by 26s, and ends with the value of `lex`.
   - `k` is 1.
   - `lex` is an integer.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')` will execute.

3. **Determine the Value of `arr[k]`**:
   - Since `k` is 1, we need to find the value of `arr[1]`.
   - According to the initial state, `arr` starts with 1s followed by 26s. Therefore, `arr[1]` must be 1 (the second element in the list).

4. **Calculate `chr(arr[k] + 96)`**:
   - Substitute `arr[1]` with 1: `arr[k] + 96 = 1 + 96 = 97`.
   - Convert the integer 97 to its corresponding character using `chr(97)`, which is 'a'.

Therefore, the print statement will output the character 'a'.

Output: **a**
