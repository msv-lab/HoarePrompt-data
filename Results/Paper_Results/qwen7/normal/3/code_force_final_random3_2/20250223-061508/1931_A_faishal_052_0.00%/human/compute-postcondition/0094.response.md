Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` must be 0.
   - `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements `[lex, ...]`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - `k` is explicitly stated to be 0.
   - Therefore, `arr[k]` refers to the first element of the list `arr`, which is `lex`.
   - We need to convert `lex` to its corresponding ASCII value by adding 96 to it.
   - In ASCII, 'a' is represented by 97, so 'l' would be 108, 'e' would be 101, and 'x' would be 120.
   - Adding 96 to these values:
     - For 'l': `108 + 96 = 204`
     - For 'e': `101 + 96 = 197`
     - For 'x': `120 + 96 = 216`

4. **Output**:
   - Since `arr[k]` is `lex`, we add 96 to 'l' (the first character of `lex`).
   - The ASCII value of 'l' plus 96 is 204.
   - Converting 204 back to a character gives us the character with ASCII value 204, which is not a standard printable character.

Given the above analysis, the output will be the character corresponding to the ASCII value 204.

Output: **\ufb04**
