Output State: **`j` is 2; `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ...]**.

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Since `arr` initially contains an additional element `lex` and `j` is 2 (which is not part of the list), `j` remains unchanged. The exact order of the other elements in the list is not specified, but they will be sorted relative to `lex`.
