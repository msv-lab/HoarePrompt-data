Output State: **`j` is 0, `lex` is less than or equal to 27, `arr` is [1]**.

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `lex - 1`. Since `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26, the new value of `lex` is now less than or equal to 27. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
