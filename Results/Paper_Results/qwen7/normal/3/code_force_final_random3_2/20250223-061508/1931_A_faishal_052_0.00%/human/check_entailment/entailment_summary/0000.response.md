Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Conditions for Appending Values to `arr`:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the conditions for appending values to the list `arr`. Specifically, it only considers two ranges (up to 26 and between 27 and 51) and always appends 26 when the condition is not met. This logic does not accurately reflect the possible values that can be derived from the encoded integer.

2. **Sorting and Printing:**
   - After constructing the list `arr`, the program sorts it and prints the first three elements. However, the construction of `arr` itself is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Handling Larger Encoded Values:**
   - The program fails to handle larger encoded values correctly. For instance, for the input `55`, the expected output is `czz`, but the program will not produce this result due to the incorrect logic in constructing `arr`.

4. **Lexicographical Order:**
   - The program does not ensure that the constructed word is the lexicographically smallest possible. The sorting step after constructing `arr` does not guarantee the correct order.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to find the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded.

Correctness: **False**
