Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and the range function arguments.

2. **Determine the initial values of the loop variables**:
   - The variable `j` is initialized to 0 (since `range(2)` generates values from 0 to 1).
   - The range function argument is 2, meaning the loop will run twice (for `j = 0` and `j = 1`).

3. **Check if the loop can execute based on the given state**:
   - The state before the loop mentions that `total` is not mentioned, `i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq cases \leq 100\), `arr` is an empty list, and `lex` is an input integer.
   - The loop itself does not depend on `total`, `i`, `cases`, `arr`, or `lex`. It only depends on `j` and the range value.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop will execute regardless of the values of `total`, `i`, `cases`, `arr`, and `lex`, these variables do not need to be adjusted.
   - The only variables in the loop head are `j`, and it will take on the values 0 and 1 during the loop iterations.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are simply the values of `j` as it progresses through the loop.

**State:**
- `j` is 0 (initial value)
- `j` will take on the values 0 and 1 during the loop iterations

So, the final state is:

**State: **`j` is 0, `j` will take on the values 0 and 1 during the loop iterations**
