Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is either between 0 and 26 or greater than 26, `arr` is [26, 1, `lex`]**.

Explanation: The loop has already executed exactly 2 times, setting `j` to 2. The value of `lex` remains unchanged from its last state, which is either between 0 and 26 or greater than 26. The list `arr` now contains `[26, 1, lex]` after appending `lex` in the last iteration of the loop.
