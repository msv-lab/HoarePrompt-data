Output State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing the element 1**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the element `1` to the list `arr`. Regardless of the initial value of `lex`, the code does not change its value. Therefore, `lex` remains an integer, and `arr` now contains the element `1`.
