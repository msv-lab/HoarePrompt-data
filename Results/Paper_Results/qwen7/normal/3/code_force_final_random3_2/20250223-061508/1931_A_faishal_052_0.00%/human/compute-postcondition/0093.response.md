State: **`j` is 2, `k` must be 0, `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ...]** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `k` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
- The loop runs for 3 iterations (`range(3)`), so `k` will take values 0, 1, and 2.
- The initial value of `k` is 0.
- Since `k` is the loop variable, it needs to be set to its starting value, which is 0.
- The state of `j` (which is 2) does not affect the loop's execution, so it remains unchanged.
- The list `arr` is mentioned but no specific state change is required for it since the loop does not modify it directly and its sorted nature is already given.

Thus, the state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `k` being 0, while `j` and `arr` remain as stated.
