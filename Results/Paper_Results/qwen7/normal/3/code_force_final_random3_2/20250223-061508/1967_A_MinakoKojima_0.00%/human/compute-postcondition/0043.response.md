Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `k` is updated based on the expression `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now 1, `n` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1 and the loop will continue if `i < n`).

6. **Expression for `k`**: The value of `k` is updated but does not affect the loop condition directly. Therefore, no change is needed for `k` in this context.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
