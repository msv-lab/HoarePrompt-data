Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.
   - `i` is `n`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be within the range `[1, n-1]`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, incrementing `i` by 1 would make it `n + 1`. However, since the loop runs up to `n-1`, `i` must remain `1` for the loop to continue.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than `1` because the loop starts from `1` and ends at `n-1`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged as no new information about `ans` is provided for the next iteration.
   - `i` needs to be set to `1` for the loop to start.
   - `n` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
