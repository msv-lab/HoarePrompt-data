State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is decreased by `n * m`, `i` must be less than `n` and `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `i` is being initialized to `n` in the loop head.
2. The loop condition `i < n` must be true for the loop to execute at least once.
3. For the loop to start, `n` must be greater than 0 because if `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
4. The initial value of `i` (which is `n`) does not affect the loop's execution directly, but it must satisfy the loop condition `i < n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be less than `n`.
