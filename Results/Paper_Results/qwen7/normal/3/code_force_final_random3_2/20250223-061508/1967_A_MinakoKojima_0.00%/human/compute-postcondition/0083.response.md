Output State: **`ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code multiplies `ans` by the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`. Since `i` was initially 1, after executing the line, `i` is incremented to 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
