Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input decreased by `n * m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`**.

This means that the value of `k` has been updated to `k - (n * m)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
