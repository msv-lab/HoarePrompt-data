Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `k` is `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 (`i += 1`).

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` remains unchanged within the loop.

3. **Variable `k`:**
   - The value of `k` is updated based on the formula `k = k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
   - This means `k` is modified during the loop body but not directly by the loop itself.

### Adjusting the States
- Since the loop increments `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i < n`, so `n` must remain greater than 0.
- The value of `k` is not directly adjusted by the loop, but it will be updated based on the loop body, which is omitted here.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `k` will be updated based on the loop body, but its exact new value cannot be determined without knowing the loop body.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`**
