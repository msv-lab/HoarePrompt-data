Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i - 1]) - (m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i - 1]))`, `a[i]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i - 1])`**

Explanation:
- Initially, `a[i - 1]` is equal to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i - 1])`.
- The code updates `a[i]` to be `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i - 1])`.
- Since `a[i - 1]` is already defined, `min(k, m + k // n - a[i - 1])` remains unchanged.
- Therefore, `a[i]` is set to the same value as `a[i - 1]`.
- The values of `ans`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged except for the adjustment in the value of `k` due to the subtraction in its definition.
