Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are now specific integers based on the user's input.
