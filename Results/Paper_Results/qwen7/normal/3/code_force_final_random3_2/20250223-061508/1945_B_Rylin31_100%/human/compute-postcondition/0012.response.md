Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each `t`, it processes three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}). It returns a result based on these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific integer values `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. The function processes these values for each test case and returns a result accordingly.
