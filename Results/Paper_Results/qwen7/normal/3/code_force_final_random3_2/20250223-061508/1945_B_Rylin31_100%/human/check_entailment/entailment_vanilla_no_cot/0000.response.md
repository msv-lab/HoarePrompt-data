Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The formula used in the solution, `m // a + m // b + 2`, is incorrect for this problem. Instead, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. The correct approach involves calculating the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determining how many fireworks can be visible within that interval plus the additional fireworks launched by each installation independently.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        
        # Number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the LCM interval
        fireworks_a = (lcm_ab - 1) // a
        
        # Number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the LCM interval
        fireworks_b = (lcm_ab - 1) // b
        
        # Maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time
        max_visible = fireworks_a + fireworks_b + 1
        
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected function properly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously by considering the LCM of `a` and `b` and the visibility period `m`.
