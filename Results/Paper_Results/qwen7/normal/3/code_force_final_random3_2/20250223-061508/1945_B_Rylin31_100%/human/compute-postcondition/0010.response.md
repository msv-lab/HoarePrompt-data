Output State: The value of `t` must be a positive integer, `i` will be equal to `t`, `a` will be the last input integer received, `b` will be the second last input integer received, and `m` will be the third last input integer received.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still hold the initial input integer value as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will now be equal to `t` because the loop has completed all its iterations. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` will hold the values of the last three input integers provided during the loop's execution, as these are the last values assigned to them within the loop body.
