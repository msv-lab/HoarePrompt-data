Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 2 (though `t` itself is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 3.
- `a` is the first input integer.
- `b` is the second input integer.
- `m` is the third input integer.

The print statement is:
```python
print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

Here, `//` denotes integer division. The expression `m // a + m // b + 2` calculates the integer division of `m` by `a`, adds it to the integer division of `m` by `b`, and then adds 2 to the result.

Since the actual values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not specified, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(m // a + m // b + 2)**
