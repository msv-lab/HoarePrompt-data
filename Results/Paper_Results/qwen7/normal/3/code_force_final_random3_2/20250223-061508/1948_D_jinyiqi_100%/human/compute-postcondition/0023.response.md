Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and their values:

- `count` is set to 2 under certain conditions: 
  - If `s[k]` is either a '?'.
  - If `s[k + j]` is either a '?'.
  - If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.

- `n` is at least 2.
- `j` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.
- `count` is not equal to `j`.
- `k` is incremented by 1 after the condition check.

Given these conditions, `count` is explicitly set to 2. Therefore, when the print statement `print(count * 2)` is executed, it will print `count * 2`, which is `2 * 2 = 4`.

Output: **4**
