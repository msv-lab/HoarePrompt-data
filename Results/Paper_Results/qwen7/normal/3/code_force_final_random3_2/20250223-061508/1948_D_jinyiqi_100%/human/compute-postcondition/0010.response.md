Postcondition: `count` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `j` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. The character `s[k]` is either a '?', the character `s[k + j]` is either a '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`. If none of these conditions are met, then `count` remains 0, `s[k]` is not '?', `s[k + j]` is not '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
