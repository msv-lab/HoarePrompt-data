Postcondition: `count` is either 3 or 1, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not `?`, the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is not `?`, and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`. Since the condition `count == j` is not met, the program returns `None`.
