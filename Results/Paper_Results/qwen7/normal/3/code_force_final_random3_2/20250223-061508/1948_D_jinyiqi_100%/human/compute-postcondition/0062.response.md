Output State: **`count` is either 3 or 1, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not `?`, the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is not `?`, and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` was either 2 or 0 initially, after incrementing by 1, `count` will be either 3 (if it was 2) or 1 (if it was 0). The values of `k`, `n`, and the conditions regarding the characters in string `s` remain unchanged.
