Postcondition: **`count` is either 3 or 1, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not `?`, the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is not `?`, and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`**.

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts, ensuring that regardless of whether the if condition is met or not, the final state of the variables `count`, `k`, `n`, and the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` in string `s` remains consistent with the provided conditions.
