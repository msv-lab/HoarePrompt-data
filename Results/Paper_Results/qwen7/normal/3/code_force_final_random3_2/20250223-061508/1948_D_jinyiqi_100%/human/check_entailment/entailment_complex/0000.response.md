Reasoning:
The provided program logic seems to be attempting to solve the problem correctly, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Call Missing**: The function `func_1()` is called in the main loop, but the input handling and the actual function call are not properly aligned. The `input()` should be inside the loop to handle each test case separately.

2. **Logic Flaw in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check for tandem repeats by iterating backward from the middle of the string. However, the logic for counting matching characters and determining if a tandem repeat is found is flawed.
   - The variable `count` is incremented only when characters match or are question marks, but it does not reset properly between different starting points `k`.

3. **Output Handling**: The function should print the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat found, but the current implementation prints either the length of the tandem repeat or 0 without keeping track of the maximum length found.

To correct the program, we need to:
- Ensure `func_1` is called for each test case.
- Properly implement the logic to find the longest tandem repeat.
- Keep track of the maximum length of the tandem repeat found.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = list(input().strip())
    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0
    
    for start in range(n):
        for length in range(1, n - start + 1, 2):  # Only even lengths
            if start + length > n:
                break
            is_tandem_repeat = True
            for i in range(length // 2):
                if s[start + i] != '?' and s[start + i] != s[start + length - i - 1]:
                    is_tandem_repeat = False
                    break
            if is_tandem_repeat:
                max_length = max(max_length, length)
    
    print(max_length)
```

Explanation:
- We iterate over each possible starting point of the substring.
- For each starting point, we check all possible even-length substrings.
- We use a flag `is_tandem_repeat` to check if the substring is a tandem repeat.
- We update `max_length` with the maximum length of the tandem repeat found.
- Finally, we print the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat for each test case.

Given the above corrections, the original program is **incorrect** because it does not handle the input correctly and does not implement the logic to find the longest tandem repeat properly.

Correctness: **False**
