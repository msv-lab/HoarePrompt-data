Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case consists of three non-negative integers (a, b, and c) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, if the first integer (a) is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, the function returns a result based on the values of a, b, and c. If a is not within this range, the function returns an error message.**
