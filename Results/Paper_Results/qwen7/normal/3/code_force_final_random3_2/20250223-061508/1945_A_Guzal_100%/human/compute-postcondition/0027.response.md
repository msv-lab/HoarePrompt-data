Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `k` is 0.**

The code initializes `k` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `k` is updated to 0.
