Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` must be 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` must be 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - `k` is either `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if `b` is not divisible by 3 and `b % 3 + c` is less than 3, or `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` and `(b + c) % 3` is not equal to 0.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain greater than 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
- `t` remains the same (since it is not part of the loop head).
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the updated state is:
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is either `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if `b` is not divisible by 3 and `b % 3 + c` is less than 3, or `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` and `(b + c) % 3` is not equal to 0.**

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is either `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if `b` is not divisible by 3 and `b % 3 + c` is less than 3, or `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` and `(b + c) % 3` is not equal to 0.**
