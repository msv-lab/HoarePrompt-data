Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is either `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if `b` is not divisible by 3 and `b % 3 + c` is less than 3, or `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` and `(b + c) % 3` is not equal to 0.**
