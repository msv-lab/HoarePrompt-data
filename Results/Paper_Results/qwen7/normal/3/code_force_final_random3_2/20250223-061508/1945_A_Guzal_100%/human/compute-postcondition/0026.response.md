Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is not directly affected by the code. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, `i` remains 2, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers entered by the user.
