You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    4 8
    1 4

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 99 (since the loop runs `x` times and `x` can be any positive integer up to 100 based on the initial state), `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer, and after executing the if-else block 99 times, the final values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers provided as input, with the condition that either `x` is less than `y` or `x` is greater than or equal to `y` remains unchanged. The variable `t` remains within its initial bounds, and `i` reaches its maximum possible value given the constraints of the problem.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 9\). For each test case, it prints the pair \(x, y\) if \(x < y\), otherwise it prints \(y, x\). After processing all test cases, it ensures that the output respects the given constraints and conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It reads a single integer `x` at the beginning and then processes `x` test cases in a loop, which is incorrect. Instead, it should read the number of test cases `t` first, and then process each test case individually. Here is an example where the program fails:

Input:
```
2
5 3
7 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3 5
2 7
```

Actual Output:
```
3 5
5 3
```

The program does not correctly handle the second test case because it uses the value of `x` from the first test case for the second test case, leading to incorrect results.
