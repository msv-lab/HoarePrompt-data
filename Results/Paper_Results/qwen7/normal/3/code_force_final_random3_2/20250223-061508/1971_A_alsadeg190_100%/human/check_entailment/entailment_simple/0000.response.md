Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
3. It then compares `x` and `y` and prints the minimum followed by the maximum.
4. The logic inside the loop is correct:
   - If `x < y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.
5. The loop runs exactly `t` times, ensuring all test cases are processed.
6. There are no logical errors or issues with the flow of the program based on the provided comments and the problem description.

Given this analysis, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
