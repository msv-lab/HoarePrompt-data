Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the value `x`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < x`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - If `x` is less than `y`, the condition remains unchanged. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the condition also remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged because it is used as the upper limit of the range in the loop, and it does not change within the loop body.

5. **New State**:
   - `t` remains the same since it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `x` remains the same as it was before the loop started.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and if `x` is less than `y`, the condition remains unchanged. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the condition also remains unchanged.**
