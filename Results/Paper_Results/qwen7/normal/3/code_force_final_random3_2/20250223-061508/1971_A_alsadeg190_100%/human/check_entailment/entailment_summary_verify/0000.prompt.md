You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 9\). For each test case, it prints the pair \(x, y\) if \(x < y\), otherwise it prints \(y, x\). After processing all test cases, it ensures that the output respects the given constraints and conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It reads a single integer `x` at the beginning and then processes `x` test cases in a loop, which is incorrect. Instead, it should read the number of test cases `t` first, and then process each test case individually. Here is an example where the program fails:

Input:
```
2
5 3
7 2
```

Expected Output:
```
3 5
2 7
```

Actual Output:
```
3 5
5 3
```

The program does not correctly handle the second test case because it uses the value of `x` from the first test case for the second test case, leading to incorrect results.
