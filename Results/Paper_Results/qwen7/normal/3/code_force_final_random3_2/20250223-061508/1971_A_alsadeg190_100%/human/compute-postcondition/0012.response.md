Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `y` is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer.
- The condition `x < y` or `x \geq y` remains unchanged.

The `print(x, y)` statement will print the values of `x` and `y`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified beyond the conditions given, the output will be the specific values of `x` and `y` as they are determined by the input.

Output: **x, y (where x is an input integer greater than 0 and y is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer)**
