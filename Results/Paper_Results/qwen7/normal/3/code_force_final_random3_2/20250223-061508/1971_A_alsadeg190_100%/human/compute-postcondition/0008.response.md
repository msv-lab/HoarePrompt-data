Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and if `x` is less than `y`, the condition remains unchanged. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the condition also remains unchanged.
