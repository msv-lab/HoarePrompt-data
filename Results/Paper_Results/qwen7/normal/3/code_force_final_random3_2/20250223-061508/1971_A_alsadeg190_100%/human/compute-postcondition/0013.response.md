Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `y` is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer.
- The condition `x < y` or `x ≥ y` remains unchanged.

The `print(y, x)` statement will print the values of `y` and `x`.

Since `y` is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer, and `x` is an input integer greater than 0, the exact values of `y` and `x` depend on the user's input. However, based on the precondition, we know these values will satisfy the condition `x < y` or `x ≥ y`.

Output: **y, x (where y is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer, and x is an input integer greater than 0 that satisfies the condition x < y or x ≥ y)**
