Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer, and now `x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

This means that the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and `x` and `y` are now assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. The condition `x` is less than `y` or `x` is greater than or equal to `y` remains unchanged.
