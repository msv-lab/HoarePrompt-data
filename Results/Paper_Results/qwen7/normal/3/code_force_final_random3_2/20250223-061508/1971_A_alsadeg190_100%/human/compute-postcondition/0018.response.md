Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `y` is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer, and now `x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.

This means that `x` and `y` are both integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting it to integers. Since `x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input split, they are essentially the same value.

Therefore, the `print(y, x)` statement will print the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`, which are the same.

Output: **y y**
