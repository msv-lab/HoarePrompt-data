The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 9\). For each test case, it prints the pair \(x, y\) if \(x < y\), otherwise it prints \(y, x\). After processing all test cases, it ensures that the output respects the given constraints and conditions.
