Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `y` is an integer obtained from the input split and converted to an integer, and now `x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.

The `print(x, y)` statement will print the values of `x` and `y`.

Since `x` and `y` are both assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, they will have the same value.

Output: **x y (where x and y are the values obtained from the input split and converted to integers)**
