Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`**.

The value of `k` is updated to be the sum of `a` and the integer division of `(b + c)` by 3. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
