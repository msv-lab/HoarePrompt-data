Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the given state, so it should be set to the starting value of the `range` function, which is `0`.
   - `n` is an input integer, but its value is not specified in the initial state. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is the index variable in the `range` function, it should be set to `0` at the start of the loop.
   - `n` must be a non-negative integer for the loop to execute. Given that `n` is an input integer, we can assume it is valid as per the problem constraints (i.e., it will be a non-negative integer).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute properly.

**State:**
- `i` is `0`
- `n` must be a non-negative integer

Putting this together:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a non-negative integer**
