Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`**.

The value of `k` is incremented by 1. Since `b + c` is not divisible by 3, `(b + c) // 3` is the integer division of `b + c` by 3. Therefore, `k` becomes `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. The values of `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
