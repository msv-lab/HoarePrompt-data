Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `_` is not affected and retains its initial value of 1.
