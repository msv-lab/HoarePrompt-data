Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and \(10^4\), `_` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged from their initial state.
