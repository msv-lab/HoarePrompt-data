State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is automatically initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so no adjustment is needed for `_`.
- The variable `t` determines whether the loop will execute. Since the loop runs `t` times, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) and within the specified range (1 to \(10^4\)).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
