Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user after the last iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` starts at `start` and decreases by 1 each time through the loop. Since the loop continues as long as `t > 0`, once `t` reaches 0, the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` will be 0. The values of `start`, `end`, `n`, and `s` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
