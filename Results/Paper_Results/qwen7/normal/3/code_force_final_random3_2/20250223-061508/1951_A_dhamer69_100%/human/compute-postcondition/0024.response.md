Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` and `end` are integers (their specific values are not relevant to the print statement).
- `t` is greater than 0 (its specific value is not relevant).
- `n` is an input integer (its specific value is not relevant).
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `n` is not equal to 2.
- `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s` and it is even.
- The current value of `count_1` is 2.
- The string `s` contains exactly one instance of '11'.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will simply print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of other variables.

Output: **NO**
