Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, and `n` is not equal to 2; `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`, and `count_1` is even. Additionally, either `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1 or `count_1` is not equal to 2.
