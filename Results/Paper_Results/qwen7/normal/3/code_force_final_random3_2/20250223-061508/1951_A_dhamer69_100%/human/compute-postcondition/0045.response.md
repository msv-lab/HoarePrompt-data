Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`, and `count_1` is calculated as `s.count('1')`. If `s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`, the conditions are met. Otherwise, the conditions do not change.**
