Correctness: **False**

The provided program `func` does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python program that generates `.py` files (`ac.py` and `wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in subfolders whose names fall within a specified range. However, the given program `func` is a completely different function that reads input from stdin and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions related to binary strings. Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the provided problem description.
