Output State: **All keys in the `nodes` defaultdict that have a list of length 1 are appended to the `leaves` deque, `start` is an input integer, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`**.

Explanation: The code `moves = func_1(nodes, start)` calls the function `func_1` with the arguments `nodes` and `start`. The function `func_1` returns a value which is assigned to the variable `moves`. The initial state of `nodes` and `leaves` remains unchanged except that the keys in `nodes` with a list of length 1 are appended to the `leaves` deque. The value of `start` remains as an input integer.
