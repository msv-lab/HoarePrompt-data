Output State: **`empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key has a list as its value containing all the nodes connected to it with at least one key, and the length of the list corresponding to the key is exactly 1; `leaves` is a list containing the key.**

Explanation: The code appends the `key` to the `leaves` list. Since `leaves` was not defined before, it is assumed to be a new list initialized with the `key`. All other variables (`empty` and `nodes`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
