Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a tree with `n` nodes.
   - There are `t` rounds, but since `t=1`, we only need to handle one round.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an unvisited neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The goal is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - In a tree, a node can be a leaf (degree 1), or it can have more than one neighbor.
   - The game ends when a player cannot move the stone to an unvisited neighbor.
   - The parity (odd/even) of the distance from the starting node to other nodes determines the winner.

3. **Code Breakdown:**

   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
     - It uses recursion to traverse the tree.
     - However, the function does not correctly calculate distances. Instead, it returns a list of distances extended by 1 for each recursive call, which is incorrect.

   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - Reads input values for `n` and `t`.
     - Constructs the tree using adjacency lists.
     - Identifies leaves (nodes with degree 1) and stores them in a deque.
     - Calls `func_1` to get the distances from the starting node.
     - Checks if any distance is odd. If so, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The main issue lies in `func_1`. The function should calculate the shortest path distances from the starting node to all other nodes, but it incorrectly extends distances without proper initialization and base case handling.
   - The logic to determine the winner based on the parity of distances is correct, but the distances themselves are not calculated correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the distances from the starting node to all other nodes. Therefore, the determination of the winner based on these distances will also be incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
