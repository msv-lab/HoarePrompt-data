Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one tuple (u, v), `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially lists, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to variables `u` and `v`. These values are converted from strings to integers using the `int` function. Since these are the first edges being added, `edges` starts as an empty list and now contains one tuple `(u, v)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
