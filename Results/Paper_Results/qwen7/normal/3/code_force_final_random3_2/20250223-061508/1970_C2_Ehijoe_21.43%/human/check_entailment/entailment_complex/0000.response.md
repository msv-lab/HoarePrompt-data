### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game and Problem Statement**:
   - The game involves a tree with \(n\) nodes, and there are \(t = 1\) round.
   - The goal is to determine whether Ron or Hermione wins based on the parity of the minimum distance from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the shortest path distances from a given starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - If the starting node has only one neighbor (excluding the parent), it returns `[0]`.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances to all neighbors and returns a list of these distances.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - Reads the input values for \(n\), \(t\), edges, and the starting node.
   - Constructs the graph using a `defaultdict` to store adjacency lists.
   - Identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one neighbor).
   - Calls `func_1` to get the list of distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - Checks if any of these distances are odd. If at least one distance is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies the winning player based on the parity of the minimum distance from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the shortest path distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - The overall logic aligns with the game rules and the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the parity of the minimum distance from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree.

**Correctness: **True**
