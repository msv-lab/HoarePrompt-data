Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one tuple \((u, v)\), `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially lists, `i` is 4, `nodes[u]` is a list containing `v`.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list associated with the key `u` in the `nodes` defaultdict. Since `u` and `v` are the first and second integer inputs respectively, the list for `nodes[u]` is updated to include `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
