Output State: **`empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key has a list as its value containing all the nodes connected to it with at least one key, and `leaves` now has the key appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `leaves.append(key)` appends the `key` to the `leaves` list. The initial state of `empty` remains `False`, and the `nodes` dictionary structure remains unchanged. The only change is that `key` is added to the `leaves` list.
