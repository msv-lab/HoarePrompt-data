Postcondition: `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key has a list as its value containing all the nodes connected to it with at least one key. If the length of the list corresponding to the key is exactly 1, then `leaves` is a list containing the key. Otherwise, `leaves` remains unchanged.
