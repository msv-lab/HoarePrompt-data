Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, each tuple (u, v) indicates an undirected edge between nodes u and v, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and `moves` is a list of integers representing the sequence of moves made during the game; `n` is updated to the integer value entered by the user, `t` is updated to the integer value entered by the user.**

The code reads two integers from the input, updates `n` and `t` with these values, and leaves the other variables unchanged. Since the input values for `n` and `t` are read and stored, their values are now specific and depend on the user's input.
