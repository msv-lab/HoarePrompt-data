Postcondition: **All keys in the `nodes` defaultdict that have a list of length 1 are appended to the `leaves` deque, `start` is an input integer, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`. If at least one move in `moves` is an odd number, the condition is met. Otherwise, all moves in `moves` are even numbers.**
