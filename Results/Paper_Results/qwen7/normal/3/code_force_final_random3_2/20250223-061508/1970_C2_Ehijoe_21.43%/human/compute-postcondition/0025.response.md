Output State: **`empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key has a list as its value containing all the nodes connected to it with at least one key, `leaves` has the key appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the `key` to the `leaves` list. Since `empty` is initially `False` and `nodes` remains unchanged, the only change is that `key` is added to the `leaves` list.
