Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`, `i` is incremented to `i + 1` where `i + 1 <= isqrt(x)**.

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated to the maximum between its current value and `x // i`. Additionally, `i` has been incremented by 1, and the condition for `i` is that it should be less than or equal to the integer square root of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
