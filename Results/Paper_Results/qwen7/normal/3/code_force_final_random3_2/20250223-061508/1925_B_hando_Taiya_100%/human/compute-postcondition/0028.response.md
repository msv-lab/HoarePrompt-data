Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and either `i` (if `n <= x // i`) or remains unchanged (if `n > x // i`), and `i` is incremented to `i + 1` where `i + 1 <= isqrt(x)`.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `n <= x // i` is true, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`, and `i` is incremented. If the condition is false, `ans` remains unchanged, and `i` is still incremented.
