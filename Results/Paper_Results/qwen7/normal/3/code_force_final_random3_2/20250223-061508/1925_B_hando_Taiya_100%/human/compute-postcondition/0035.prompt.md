Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `ans` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if n <= x // i:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if n <= i:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and either `x // i` or `i` depending on whether `n <= i` is true, where `i` is a divisor of `x` and \(x \% i == 0\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and either `x // i` (if `n <= i`) or remains unchanged (if `n > i`), and `i` is incremented to `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `i + 1 <= isqrt(x)\).

This means that after the if-else block executes, `t` remains within the range of \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` remains within the range of \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` remains within the range of \(1 \leq n \leq x\), and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and either `x // i` if `n <= i` or remains unchanged if `n > i`. Additionally, `i` is incremented to `i + 1` as long as `i + 1` is less than or equal to the integer square root of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i` (if `n <= i`), and `i` is incremented to `i + 1` where `i + 1 <= isqrt(x)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
