Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `i`, `i` is a divisor of `x` and \(x \% i == 0\), and the condition `n <= x // i` is true.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
