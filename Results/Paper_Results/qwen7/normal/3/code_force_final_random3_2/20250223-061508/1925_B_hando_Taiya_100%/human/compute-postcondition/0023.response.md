Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and either `x // i` (if `n <= i`) or remains unchanged (if `n > i`), and `i` is incremented to `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `i + 1 <= isqrt(x)`.
