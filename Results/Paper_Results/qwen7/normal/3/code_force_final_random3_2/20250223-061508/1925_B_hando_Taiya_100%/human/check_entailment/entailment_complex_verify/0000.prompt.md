You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i` for all divisors `i` of `x` such that `n <= i` or `n <= x // i`, and `i` has been incremented to `isqrt(x) + 1` after the loop completes.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the maximum value between ans and x // i for all divisors i of x such that n <= i or n <= x // i)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by input integers \(t\), \(x\), and \(n\). For each test case, it calculates the maximum value between \(ans\) and \(x // i\) for all divisors \(i\) of \(x\) such that \(n \leq i\) or \(n \leq x // i\). After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of \(ans\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum balance of the problemset. Specifically, the program only checks divisors of `x` and does not ensure that the number of sub-problems `n` is used optimally. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  12 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

In this case, the optimal solution would be to split the problem of difficulty 12 into four sub-problems with difficulties 3, 3, 3, and 3, which gives a balance of 3. However, the program only checks divisors and does not ensure that the number of sub-problems `n` is used optimally. Therefore, the program fails to handle this case correctly.
