Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump suit` is a string, `trumps` is a list containing one element which is `rank` if the suit matches the trump suit, otherwise it is an empty list, `answers` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with a space (if `suits[suit]` is `None`), `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None` except for the key `suit` which is now mapped to `rank` (if `suits[suit]` is not `None`), `rank` is the rank of the current card, `suit` is the suit of the current card.**

Explanation: The code `rank, suit = card` unpacks the tuple `card` into two variables `rank` and `suit`. These new variables hold the rank and suit of the current card being processed. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
