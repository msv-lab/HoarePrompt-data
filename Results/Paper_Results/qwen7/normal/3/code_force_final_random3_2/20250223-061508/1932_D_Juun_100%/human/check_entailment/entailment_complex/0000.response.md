Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and constraints as specified in the problem statement.
2. The logic for identifying trump cards and generating valid answers is sound. The program correctly sorts and matches ranks for non-trump cards and uses the trump cards to beat non-trump cards when necessary.
3. The program correctly handles the scenario where there are no valid answers, printing "IMPOSSIBLE" as required.
4. The program processes all cards and generates the required output in the correct format.
5. The final loop that prints pairs of remaining trump cards in descending order of their ranks also follows the correct logic.

Given the above points, the annotated program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
