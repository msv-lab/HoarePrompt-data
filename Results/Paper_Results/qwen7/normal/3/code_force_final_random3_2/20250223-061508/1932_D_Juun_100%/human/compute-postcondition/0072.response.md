Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution with each element being a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are `None`. `trumps` is sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `trumps` list in descending order using the `sorted()` function with the `reverse=True` parameter. Since `trumps` was initially an empty list, sorting an empty list does not change its state. The `answers` and `suits` dictionaries remain unchanged from their previous states.
