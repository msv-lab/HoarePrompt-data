Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump suit` is a string, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None`, `rank` is the rank of the card, `suit` is the suit of the card.**

The code `rank, suit = card` unpacks the tuple `card` into two variables, `rank` and `suit`. Since `card` contains at least one card, `rank` will hold the rank of the card and `suit` will hold the suit of the card. However, the values of `t`, `n`, `trump suit`, `trumps`, `answers`, and `suits` remain unchanged.
