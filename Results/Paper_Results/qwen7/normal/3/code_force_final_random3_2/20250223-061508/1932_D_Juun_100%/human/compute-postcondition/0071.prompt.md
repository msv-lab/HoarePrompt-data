Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All cards have been processed, `trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values are all `None`.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that match the trump suit except for the last one, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution with the new element added which is a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be something other than None, and the current value of `rank` remains `None`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that match the trump suit except for the last two elements, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution with the new element added which is a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be something other than `None`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that match the trump suit except for the last element, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution with the new element added which is a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be something other than `None`. If `trumps` is not empty, the function continues and `trumps` is updated by popping the last element. If `trumps` is empty, the function returns None.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
