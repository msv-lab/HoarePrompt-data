Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: `trumps` is not an empty list.
   - This means `trumps` contains at least one element.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
   ```

   - `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the list `trumps`.
   - The result of `trumps.pop()` is concatenated with `trump`.
   - Another `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the new last element of the list `trumps`.
   - The result of this second `trumps.pop()` is also concatenated with `trump`.

Given that `trumps` is not an empty list, let's denote the elements of `trumps` as `[e1, e2, ..., en]` where `n` is the number of elements in the list.

- The first call to `trumps.pop()` will remove and return the last element, `en`.
- The second call to `trumps.pop()` will then remove and return the new last element, which was previously `en-1`.

Thus, the expression `f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'` will be evaluated as follows:
- First, `trumps.pop()` returns `en` and the list becomes `[e1, e2, ..., en-1]`.
- Then, `trumps.pop()` returns `en-1` and the list becomes `[e1, e2, ..., en-2]`.

So, the final output will be:
Output: **enen-1 trump en-1trump**
