Output State: **`trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that match the trump suit except for the last element, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution with the new element added which is a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be something other than `None`. We continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop continues. Therefore, the lists `trumps` and `answers` are updated as described in the initial state, and the dictionary `suits` remains unchanged.
