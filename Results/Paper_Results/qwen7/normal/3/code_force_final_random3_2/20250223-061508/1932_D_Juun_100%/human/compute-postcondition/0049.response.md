Output State: **`trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that match the trump suit except for the last one, `answers` is a list containing all valid answers generated during the loop execution with the new element added which is a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and at least one value must be something other than None, and the current value of `rank` remains `None`.**

Explanation: The code appends a formatted string to the `answers` list using the current `rank` and `suit`, and removes the last element from the `trumps` list. Since the initial value of `rank` is `None`, the string appended to `answers` will be in the format `{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}`. The `trumps` list loses its last element due to `trumps.pop()`. All other variables remain unchanged.
