Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, with `t` being the initial input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` equal to `t`, and `a`, `b`, and `m` holding the last set of input integers processed within the loop. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution, and `i` increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `t`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated based on the input provided in each iteration but retain the final values from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` will still be the initial input, `i` will be equal to `t`, and `a`, `b`, and `m` will hold the values from the last set of inputs processed by the loop.
