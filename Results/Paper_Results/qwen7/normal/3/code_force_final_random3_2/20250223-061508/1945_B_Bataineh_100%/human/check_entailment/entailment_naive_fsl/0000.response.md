Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` is greater than 1. In such cases, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously would be higher than what the current implementation calculates.

For example, consider the input `(a=6, b=8, m=4)`:
- The GCD of 6 and 8 is 2.
- According to the program, since `m < a` and `m < b`, it prints `2`. However, the actual maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 3 because:
  - Fireworks from the first installation: [4, 6, 8]
  - Fireworks from the second installation: [4, 8]

In this case, the fireworks launched at 4 minutes from both installations are visible at the same time, along with the fireworks launched at 8 minutes from the first installation. Therefore, the program incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `3`.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then determine the maximum number of overlapping intervals.
