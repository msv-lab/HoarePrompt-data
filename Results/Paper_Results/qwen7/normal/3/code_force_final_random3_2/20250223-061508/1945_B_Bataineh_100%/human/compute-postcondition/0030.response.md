Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are input integers, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values from the input split. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
