Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all edge cases and scenarios. Let's analyze why:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The current logic does not fully account for the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which is crucial for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks**: The solution attempts to calculate the number of simultaneous fireworks based on the visibility period `m` and the launch intervals `a` and `b`. However, it does not correctly compute the LCM of `a` and `b`, which is necessary to determine the optimal launch times where the maximum number of fireworks are visible simultaneously.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then use it to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time within the visibility period `m`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b
        l = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of multiples of LCM within the visibility period m
        max_simultaneous = m // l + 1
        print(max_simultaneous)

# Example usage
func()
```

This approach ensures that we correctly account for the LCM of `a` and `b`, which helps in determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
