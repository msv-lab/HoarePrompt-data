Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
3. The logic for calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is as follows:
   - If `m < a` and `m < b`, it prints `2`. This is correct because in this scenario, no fireworks from the same installation will overlap since their intervals are larger than `m`.
   - If `m < a` and `m > b`, it prints `2 + m // b`. This is also correct because the first installation launches fireworks every `a` minutes, and the second every `b` minutes. The number of fireworks from the second installation visible at the same time as any from the first is `m // b`.
   - If `m < b` and `m > a`, it prints `2 + m // a`. This is correct for the same reason as above but considering the roles of `a` and `b` are swapped.
   - If `m >= a` and `m >= b`, it prints `m // a + m // b + 2`. This is correct because the number of fireworks from each installation visible at the same time is `m // a` and `m // b`, plus the 2 fireworks from the same installation.

Given the logic and the conditions checked, the program correctly handles all cases as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
