Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
