Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze why:

1. **Penalty Calculation**: The program aims to minimize the penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\). However, it only counts the number of times an element in the array is larger than the next element, which doesn't directly translate to the optimal penalty calculation as required.

2. **Logic for Splitting**: The logic in the loop tries to maintain two variables `la` and `lb`, but it does not ensure that the resulting subsequences \(s\) and \(t\) are optimal for minimizing the penalty. Specifically, the logic for updating `la` and `lb` and incrementing `ans` does not align with the requirement to split the array into two subsequences that minimize the total penalty.

3. **Optimal Splitting**: The problem requires finding the optimal way to split the array into two subsequences such that the sum of penalties of these two subsequences is minimized. The given program does not implement this optimal strategy.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one would need to use a more sophisticated algorithm, possibly involving dynamic programming or a greedy approach that ensures the optimal splitting of the array. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect for solving the problem as stated.
