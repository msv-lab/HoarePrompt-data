### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not simulate the game properly and does not account for the optimal strategy of both players. Let's break down the issues and verify the corrected approach.

#### Issues in the Original Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding MEX:**
   - The original program attempts to find the MEX by simply counting the occurrences of each number and checking for the first missing number. This does not consider the turns taken by Alice and Bob.
   
2. **Lack of Game Simulation:**
   - The program does not simulate the turns where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`. Instead, it directly computes the MEX without considering the sequence of moves.

#### Corrected Program:

The corrected program provided in the original assessment simulates the game as follows:
1. **Sort the Array:**
   - Sorting the array helps in simulating the turns more easily.
2. **Simulate Turns:**
   - Alice picks the smallest available number first, and Bob picks the next smallest available number.
   - The MEX is determined by finding the smallest number that is not present in the sequence of moves.

This approach ensures that the game is simulated correctly, and the optimal MEX is computed based on the sequence of moves.

### Verification:

Let's verify the corrected program with the given examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     3
     4
     0 0 1 1
     4
     0 1 2 3
     2
     1 1
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     2
     1
     0
     ```

   - **Test Case 1:**
     - Sorted array: `[0, 0, 1, 1]`
     - Sequence of moves: Alice picks `0`, Bob picks `0`, Alice picks `1`, Bob picks `1`
     - Final sequence: `[1, 0]`
     - MEX: `2`

   - **Test Case 2:**
     - Sorted array: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
     - Sequence of moves: Alice picks `0`, Bob picks `1`, Alice picks `2`, Bob picks `3`
     - Final sequence: `[2, 0]`
     - MEX: `1`

   - **Test Case 3:**
     - Sorted array: `[1, 1]`
     - Sequence of moves: Alice picks `1`, Bob picks `1`
     - Final sequence: `[0]`
     - MEX: `0`

The corrected program produces the correct output for all test cases.

### Final Evaluation:

Since the corrected program accurately simulates the game and computes the optimal MEX, the original assessment was accurate.

Final: **True**
