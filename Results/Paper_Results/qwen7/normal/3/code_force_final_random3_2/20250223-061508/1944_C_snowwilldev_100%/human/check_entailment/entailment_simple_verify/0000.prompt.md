You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed N times, so `i` is N-1. The dictionary `cnt` contains the count of each element in the list `a` up to the last index processed.
    #
    #In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `N-1`, indicating that the loop has processed every element in the list `a` exactly once. The `defaultdict` `cnt` will contain the count of each unique value found in the list `a`. Specifically, for each `j` in the range from 0 to `N-1`, `cnt[j]` will be the number of times `j` appears in the list `a`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `N`, `N` remains a non-negative integer, `cnt` contains the count of each element in the list `a` up to the `N-1`th index, and `t` is incremented by 1 for each index `i` where `cnt[i]` is equal to 1. The function will return `i` (which is `N`) if `t` is less than 2 and `cnt[N]` is not 0. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[N]` is 0, the function will return `N`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob. The function `func_1` attempts to count how many unique elements are present in the array `a` and returns the smallest non-negative integer that is not present among these unique elements. However, this approach does not consider the turns taken by Alice and Bob and their respective goals.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
1
0
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
1
1
0
```

For the first test case, the correct sequence of moves would be:
1. Alice picks 1, so `a = [0, 0]` and `c = [1]`.
2. Bob picks 0, so `a = [0]` and `c = [1]`.
3. Alice picks 0, so `a = []` and `c = [1, 0]`.

The MEX of `[1, 0]` is 2, but the program incorrectly outputs 1.

This discrepancy shows that the program does not correctly simulate the optimal play of both players, hence the correctness is **False**.
