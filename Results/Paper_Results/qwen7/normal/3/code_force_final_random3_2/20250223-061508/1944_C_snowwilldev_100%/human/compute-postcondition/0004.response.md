Output State: **`i` is 0; `cnt[a[i]]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `a[0]` is accessed and its count in `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since no specific value for `a[0]` is given, we denote the updated count as `cnt[a[0]]` which is now 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
