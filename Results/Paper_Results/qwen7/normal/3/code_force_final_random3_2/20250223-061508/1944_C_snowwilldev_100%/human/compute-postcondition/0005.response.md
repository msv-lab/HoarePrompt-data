Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `N`. However, since `N` is a constant and does not change within the loop, we only need to focus on `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `N`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 0
   - `cnt[a[i]]` is 1

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will become 1.
   - The condition for the next iteration is `i < N`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `N`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `cnt[a[i]]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`, but since the problem does not specify what happens inside the loop body, we only update `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `cnt[a[i]]` is 1**
