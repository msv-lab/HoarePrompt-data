#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed N times, so `i` is N-1. The dictionary `cnt` contains the count of each element in the list `a` up to the last index processed.
    #
    #In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `N-1`, indicating that the loop has processed every element in the list `a` exactly once. The `defaultdict` `cnt` will contain the count of each unique value found in the list `a`. Specifically, for each `j` in the range from 0 to `N-1`, `cnt[j]` will be the number of times `j` appears in the list `a`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `N`, `N` remains a non-negative integer, `cnt` contains the count of each element in the list `a` up to the `N-1`th index, and `t` is incremented by 1 for each index `i` where `cnt[i]` is equal to 1. The function will return `i` (which is `N`) if `t` is less than 2 and `cnt[N]` is not 0. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[N]` is 0, the function will return `N`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `N` and counts the occurrences of each integer using a `defaultdict`. It then iterates through the possible values from 0 to `N`, incrementing a counter `t` for each value that appears exactly once in the list. If `t` reaches 2 or a value that does not appear in the list is encountered, the function returns the current index `i`. Otherwise, it returns `N` after completing its iterations. The function ultimately returns either 0, 1, or 2 based on the conditions met during its execution.
