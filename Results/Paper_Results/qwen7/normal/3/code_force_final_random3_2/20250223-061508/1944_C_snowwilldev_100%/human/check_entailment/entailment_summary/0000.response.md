Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` formed by the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
- The provided program attempts to solve this problem by counting the occurrences of each integer in the array `a` and then determining the smallest non-negative integer that is missing from the list of unique elements.
- However, the logic in `func_1()` is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns, and it does not account for the different strategies of Alice and Bob.
- The program should consider the optimal moves of both players. Specifically, Alice will try to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to minimize it. This involves Alice picking elements that help her achieve a higher MEX and Bob picking elements that prevent Alice from achieving a high MEX.
- The provided solution does not simulate these optimal moves; instead, it simply counts the occurrences of each integer and returns the smallest index that meets certain conditions. This does not reflect the strategic nature of the game.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
