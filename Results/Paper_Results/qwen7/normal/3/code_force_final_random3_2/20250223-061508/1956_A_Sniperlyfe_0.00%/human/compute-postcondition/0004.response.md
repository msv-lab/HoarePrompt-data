Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `q` is an integer input from the user, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting another input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `qs`. The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
