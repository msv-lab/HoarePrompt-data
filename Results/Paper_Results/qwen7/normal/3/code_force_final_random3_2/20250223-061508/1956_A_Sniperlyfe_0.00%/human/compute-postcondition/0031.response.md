Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `t` (which determines the number of iterations) and the loop counter (which is `_` but is not explicitly used in the loop body).

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**: Since the loop counter `_` is not used in the loop body and does not affect the state, we only need to consider the variable `t`.

3. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `res` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for every `n` in `qs`.

5. **Next Iteration State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `t` should be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `t` should be decreased by 1.
- `res` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the loop head.

Thus, the updated state is:

**State: **`res` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for every `n` in `qs`, `t` is decreased by 1**
