### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` is designed to simulate the process of removing players from the game until no more players can be removed in a single round.
   - `n` is the current number of players.
   - `p` is a list of indices (1-based) that represent the positions of players to be removed in each round.
   - The function iteratively reduces `n` by the number of players at positions specified in `p` that are still within the range of `n`.
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
   - Once the loop terminates, `n` will be 0, and `p` will remain unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` and appends the results to the list `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the removal process and ensures that `n` becomes 0 after all possible removals.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes each test case and prints the results as required.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and individual queries as specified in the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the described game rules.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
