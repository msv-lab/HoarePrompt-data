Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `t` is decreased by 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code reads multiple integers from input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings. Then, `map(int, ...)` converts each string in the list to an integer. This list of integers is assigned to `qs`. The value of `t` is decreased by 1, and `k` and `q` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. `p` remains as it was initially defined before this code snippet.
