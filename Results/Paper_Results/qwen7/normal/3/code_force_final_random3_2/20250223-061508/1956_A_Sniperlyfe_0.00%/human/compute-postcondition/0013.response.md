Output State: **`res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `q` is an integer input from the user, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting another input string and converting each element to an integer (with the first element removed), `n` is the first element of the updated `qs`, and `func_1(n, p)` is appended to `res`.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since `res` initially contained the result of `func_1(n, p)` once, after appending it again, `res` now contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
