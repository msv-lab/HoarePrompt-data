### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Understanding `func_1`:
- The function `func_1(n, p)` is designed to simulate the game process.
- It takes two parameters: `n`, the number of players, and `p`, which is the sequence of positions to kick out players.
- The function iteratively reduces the number of players `n` by the number of players that need to be kicked out in each round.
- The loop continues until no more players can be kicked out in a round.

#### Understanding `func_2`:
- The function `func_2()` is the main function that processes the input and outputs the results.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the sequence `k` and the number of queries `q`.
- It then reads the sequence `p` and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
- For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to get the number of winners and appends the result to the list `res`.
- Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` as specified.
   - This matches the problem description.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - The function `func_1` simulates the game process correctly.
   - It iteratively reduces the number of players by the number of players to be kicked out in each round.
   - It stops when no more players can be kicked out in a round, which is the correct stopping condition.
   - The logic inside the loop is correct for the game simulation.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case as required.
   - The output format matches the problem description.

### Key Points to Validate:
- The function `func_1` correctly handles the logic of reducing the number of players based on the sequence `p`.
- The function `func_2` correctly processes each test case and prints the results in the correct format.

### Detailed Validation Using Annotated Code:
- **Initial State**: `n` is the number of players, and `p` is the sequence of positions to kick out players.
- **Loop in `func_1`**:
  - The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
  - In each iteration, `n` is reduced by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.
  - Eventually, `n` becomes smaller than the smallest element in `p`, causing the loop to terminate.
  - At the end of the loop, `n` is set to 0, and `p` remains unchanged.
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`.
  - Calls `func_1` for each `n` in `qs` and appends the result to `res`.
  - Prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input, simulates the game process accurately, and produces the correct output.

### Final Answer
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
