Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `qs` that have not been processed.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)`
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `k` is an integer input from the user
   - `q` is an integer input from the user
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting another input string and converting each element to an integer
   - `n` is the next element of `qs`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `qs`, the variable `n` will be the next element in `qs`.
   - After processing `n`, the next element in `qs` will be taken as `n` for the next iteration.
   - The list `qs` will be modified by removing the first element (the current `n`).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `res` remains unchanged because it does not depend on the loop head variables.
   - `t` remains unchanged because it does not depend on the loop head variables.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it does not depend on the loop head variables.
   - `q` remains unchanged because it does not depend on the loop head variables.
   - `p` remains unchanged because it does not depend on the loop head variables.
   - `qs` will now be the list `qs` without its first element.
   - `n` will be the first element of the updated `qs`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `q` is an integer input from the user, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting another input string and converting each element to an integer (with the first element removed), `n` is the first element of the updated `qs`**
