The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the initial number of players in the game, and `p`, a list of positive integers where each integer represents an index in the sequence a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) and is sorted in ascending order. After executing the function, the number of players `n` is reduced to 0, and the list `p` remains unchanged.
