Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)`. This means `res` contains two identical elements, both being the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `t` is greater than 0 (though its value is not relevant for the `print` statement).
- `k` and `q` are integers input by the user.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting another input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `n` is the next element of `qs`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

This statement will join the elements of `res` into a single string, with each element converted to a string and separated by a space.

Since `res` contains two identical elements, both being the result of `func_1(n, p)`, the output will be the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated twice, separated by a space.

Output: **func_1(n, p) func_1(n, p)**
