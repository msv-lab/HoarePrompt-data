Output State: `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` iterates through every element of `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `res` will be a list where each element corresponds to the result of applying `func_1` to each integer in `qs`, in the order they appear in the list.
