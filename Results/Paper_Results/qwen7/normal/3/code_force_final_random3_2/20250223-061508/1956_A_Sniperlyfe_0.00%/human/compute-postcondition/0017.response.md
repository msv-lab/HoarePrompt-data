Output State: **`k` is the first integer input from the user, `q` is the second integer input from the user, `t` must be greater than 1, `k` and `q` are integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is an empty list, `n` does not exist as it has been iterated through all elements in `qs`.**

This means that the values of `k` and `q` have been updated to the integers input by the user, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
