To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and whether `func_2` uses `func_1` appropriately to solve the problem for each test case.

### Analysis of `func_1`

The function `func_1` aims to simulate the process of kicking out players until no more players can be kicked out in a round. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of what it does:

1. **While Loop**: The loop continues as long as `n` (the number of remaining players) is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `p`.
2. **Sum Calculation**: For each player position `x` in `p`, if `x` is less than or equal to `n`, it subtracts the count of such positions from `n`.
3. **Return Statement**: Once the loop exits, it returns the remaining number of players (`n`).

This logic correctly simulates the process of removing players at positions specified by `p` until no more players can be removed.

### Analysis of `func_2`

The function `func_2` reads input and processes each test case:

1. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Loop Over Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, followed by the sequence `p` and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
3. **Processing Each Case**: For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1` and appends the result to the list `res`.
4. **Printing Results**: It prints the results for each test case.

This function correctly processes each test case and uses `func_1` to compute the number of winners for each initial player count.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, both functions appear to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
