Given the initial state:
- `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element.
- `n` is the first element of `qs`.
- `res` is a list with one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `qs` is a list of integers with at least one element. Let's denote the first element of `qs` as `n`.
2. `res` is a list with one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`. Since `p` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

When the `print` statement is executed, it will join the elements of `res` into a single string separated by spaces and then print that string.

Output: **' ' .join(map(str, [func_1(n, p)])) (where `n` is the first element of `qs` and `func_1(n, p)` is the result of the function call)**
