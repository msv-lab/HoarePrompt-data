Output State: `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the last element of `qs`, `res` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for every element `n` in `qs`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `res` will contain the result of applying `func_1(n, p)` to every element `n` in the list `qs`. The length of `res` will be equal to the length of `qs`, and each element in `res` corresponds to the result of the function call for each element in `qs`.
