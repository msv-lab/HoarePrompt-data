Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `res` will be a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each integer `n` in `qs`, where `n` has iterated through every element of `qs`. The length of `res` will be equal to the length of `qs`. `t` will be the final value it was set to after all iterations of the loop, which must initially have been greater than 0. `k` and `q` will be the last values they were set to during the loop's iterations, and `p` will be the list of integers obtained from the last input.
