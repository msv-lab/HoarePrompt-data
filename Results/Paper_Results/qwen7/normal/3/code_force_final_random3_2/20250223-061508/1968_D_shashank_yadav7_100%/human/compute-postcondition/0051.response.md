Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`
- `k` is 0
- `b` is `p[b] - 1` repeated `n` times
- `s` is `p[s] - 1` repeated `n` times
- `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration
- `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration
- `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`

The `print('Draw')` statement will simply print the string "Draw".

Output: **Draw**
