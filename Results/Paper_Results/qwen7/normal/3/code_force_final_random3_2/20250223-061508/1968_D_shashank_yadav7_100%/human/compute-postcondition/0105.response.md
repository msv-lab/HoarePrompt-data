Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to `n-1`.
- `k` is 0.
- `bm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop.
- `s` is the result of `p[s] - 1` after the last iteration.
- `sm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop.
- `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` after the last iteration.
- `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` after the last iteration.
- `b` is the result of `p[b] - 1` after the last iteration.
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

The print statement is simply `print('Draw')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'Draw'` without referencing any variables or objects whose values need to be determined, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Draw**
