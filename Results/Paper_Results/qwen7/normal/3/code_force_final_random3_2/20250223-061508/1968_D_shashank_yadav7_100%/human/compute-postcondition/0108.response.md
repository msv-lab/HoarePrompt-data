Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `bm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop.
   - `s` is the result of `p[s] - 1` after the last iteration.
   - `sm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop.
   - `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` after the last iteration.
   - `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` after the last iteration.
   - `b` is the result of `p[b] - 1` after the last iteration.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(t):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Since `i` is set to `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n-1 + 1 = n`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The variables `k`, `bm`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, and `b` are not directly modified by the loop itself (assuming no modifications are made within the loop body). Therefore, their values remain the same unless explicitly changed within the loop body.

5. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < t`.

Given these points, let's determine the new states at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be `n` because it starts from `n-1` and increments by 1.
- `k`, `bm`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, and `b` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

Since the problem does not provide any information about modifications within the loop body, we assume these variables retain their values from the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is 0, `bm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `s` is the result of `p[s] - 1` after the last iteration, `sm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` after the last iteration, `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` after the last iteration, `b` is the result of `p[b] - 1` after the last iteration.**
