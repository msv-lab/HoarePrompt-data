Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**: 
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute if `n` is at least 1.
   - The initial value of `i` will be 0.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` should start at 0.

4. **List the Adjusted States**:
   - `k` is 1 (unchanged).
   - `b` is `input integer - 1` (unchanged).
   - `s` is `input integer - 1` (unchanged).
   - `bm` is `a[b] * k` (unchanged).
   - `sm` is `a[s] * k` (unchanged).
   - `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration (unchanged).
   - `bp` is now equal to `a[b]` (unchanged).
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces (unchanged).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces (unchanged).
   - `sp` is now equal to `a[s]` (unchanged).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
