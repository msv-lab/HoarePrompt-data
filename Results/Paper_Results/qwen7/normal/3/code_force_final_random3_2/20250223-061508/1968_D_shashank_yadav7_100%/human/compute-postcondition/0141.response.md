Output State: **`k` is decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]` twice, `bp` is increased by `a[b]` twice, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**

Explanation:
- `bp` is increased by `a[b]` again (it was already increased once before the current line).
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state or previous updates.
