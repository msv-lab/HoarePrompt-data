Output State: **`k` is an integer, `b` is `p[b]` - 1, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. The values of `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, and `bp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
