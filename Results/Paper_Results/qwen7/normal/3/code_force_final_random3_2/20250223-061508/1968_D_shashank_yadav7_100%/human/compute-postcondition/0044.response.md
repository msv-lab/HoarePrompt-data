Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1` repeated `n` times, `s` is `p[s] - 1` repeated `n` times, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n`.
- `k` will be 0 since it decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
- `b` and `s` will be adjusted `n` times according to their respective rules inside the loop.
- `bm` will hold the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` calculated in each iteration.
- `sm` will hold the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` calculated in each iteration.
- `sp` will be the cumulative sum of `a[s]` from each iteration.
- `bp` will be the cumulative sum of `a[b]` from each iteration.
