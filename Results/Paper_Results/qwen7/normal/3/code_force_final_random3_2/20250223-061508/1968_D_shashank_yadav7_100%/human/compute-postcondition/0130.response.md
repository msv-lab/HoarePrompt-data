Output State: **`bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`; `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `sp` is increased by `a[s]`; `bp` is increased by `a[b]`.**

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
