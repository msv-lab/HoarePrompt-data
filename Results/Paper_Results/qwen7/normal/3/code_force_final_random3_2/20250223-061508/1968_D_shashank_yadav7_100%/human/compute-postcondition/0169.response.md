Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by t test cases, where each test case includes integers n, k, P_B, P_S (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), a permutation p of length n, and an array a of positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i). For each test case, the function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the given conditions.**

Note: The actual processing logic and outputs for each test case are not described here as per the instruction to focus only on the parameters and return value.
