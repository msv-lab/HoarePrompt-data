Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` remains within these bounds after the input is taken. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`) are not affected by this line of code, so they retain their initial state as described.
