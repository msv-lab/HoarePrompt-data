Postcondition: **The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1` repeated `n` times, `s` is `p[s] - 1` repeated `n` times, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration. Additionally, `bm` is greater than `sm`.**
