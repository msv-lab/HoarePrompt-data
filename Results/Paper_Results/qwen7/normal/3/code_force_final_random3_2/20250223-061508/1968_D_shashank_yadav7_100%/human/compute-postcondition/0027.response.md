Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of `p[b] - 1`. Since the initial state does not provide the specific value of `p[b]`, `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
