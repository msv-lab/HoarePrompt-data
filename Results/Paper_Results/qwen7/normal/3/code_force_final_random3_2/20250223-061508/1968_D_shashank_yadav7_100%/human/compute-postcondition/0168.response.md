Output State: All the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, and `bm` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `n` will be 0, `k` will be 0, `b` will be the result of `p[b] - 1` after the last iteration, `s` will be the result of `p[s] - 1` after the last iteration, `sp` will be the cumulative sum of `a[s]` after the last iteration, `bp` will be the cumulative sum of `a[b]` after the last iteration, and `bm` will be the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop.

This means that after all iterations, `bm` will be the highest value it reached when comparing `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp` across all iterations, while `sp` and `bp` will reflect the sums accumulated from the respective indices `s` and `b`. The values of `n` and `k` will be 0, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
