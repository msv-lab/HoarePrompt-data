Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`. It only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently inside. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the implied loop or conditional structure.
