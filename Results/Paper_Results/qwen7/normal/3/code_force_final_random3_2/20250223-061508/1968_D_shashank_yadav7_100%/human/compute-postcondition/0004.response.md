Output State: **`n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces, `p` is a list of these integers, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input split by spaces and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The result is assigned to `a`, which becomes a list of integers. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state and not affected by the new assignment.
