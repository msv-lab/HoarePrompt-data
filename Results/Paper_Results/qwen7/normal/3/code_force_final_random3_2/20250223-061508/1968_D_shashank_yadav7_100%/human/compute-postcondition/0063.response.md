Output State: **`k` is 1, `b` is `input integer - 1`, `s` is `input integer - 1`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is now equal to `a[b]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `bm` to be `a[b] * k`. Since `k` is 1, `bm` is simply `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
