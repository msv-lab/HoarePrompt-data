Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sp` is `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]**.

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
