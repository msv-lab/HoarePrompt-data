Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly initializes the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. It reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` for each test case, and then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Position Adjustment**: The program adjusts the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1 from each, which is correct.

3. **Score Calculation**: The program calculates the initial scores for Bodya (`sp`) and Sasha (`bp`). It also calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) based on their starting positions and the duration of the game `k`.

4. **Game Loop**: The program enters a loop that simulates the game for `k` turns. In each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha according to the permutation `p` and recalculates their scores. It ensures that the maximum possible scores for both players are updated correctly.

5. **Final Comparison**: After the loop, the program compares the final maximum scores (`bm` and `sm`) and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

6. **Output Handling**: The program handles the output correctly for each test case.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
