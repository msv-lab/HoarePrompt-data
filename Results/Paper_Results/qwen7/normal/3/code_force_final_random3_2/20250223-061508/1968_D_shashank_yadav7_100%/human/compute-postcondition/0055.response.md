Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`
   - `k` is 0
   - `b` is `p[b] - 1` repeated `n` times
   - `s` is `p[s] - 1` repeated `n` times
   - `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration
   - `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration
   - `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration
   - `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` remains as the maximum value. Otherwise, `bm` equals `sm`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - The variable `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Since `k` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `k` will be `1`.
   - The values of `b` and `s` are determined based on the array `p` and are not directly affected by the loop itself.
   - The values of `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` are updated based on the current values of `b` and `s` and their corresponding indices in the array `a`. These values are not directly modified by the loop but depend on the loop iterations.

Given these points, the only variables that change within the loop head are `i` and `k`. Therefore, we need to update these two variables for the next iteration.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
- `i` will be `n + 1`
- `k` will be `1`

Since the other variables (`b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) are not directly modified by the loop head, they remain the same as the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `k` is 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1` repeated `n` times, `s` is `p[s] - 1` repeated `n` times, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` remains as the maximum value. Otherwise, `bm` equals `sm`.**
