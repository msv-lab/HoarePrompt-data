Output State: **`p` is a list of integers from the input, `bm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop; `s` is the result of `p[s] - 1` after the last iteration; `sm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop; `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` after the last iteration; `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` after the last iteration; `b` is the result of `p[b] - 1` after the last iteration; `a` is now a list of integers from the input.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `p`, `bm`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
