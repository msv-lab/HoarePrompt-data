Output State: **`b` is `p[b] - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of `p[b] - 1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state because they are not directly affected by the given code snippet. Since `k` is still 0, we also note that we would break out of the most internal loop or if statement if such a condition was present.
