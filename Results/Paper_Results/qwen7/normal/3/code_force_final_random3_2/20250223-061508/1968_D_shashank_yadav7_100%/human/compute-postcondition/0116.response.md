Output State: **`p` is a list of integers from the input, `bm` is now `a[b] * k`, `s` is now `p[s] - 2`, `sm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `sp` is now `a[s]`, `bp` is now `a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `a` is now a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `bm` to be `a[b] * k`. All other variables retain their previous values.
