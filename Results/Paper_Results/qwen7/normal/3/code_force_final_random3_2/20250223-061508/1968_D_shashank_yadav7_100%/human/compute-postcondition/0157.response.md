Postcondition: **`k` is 0, `n` is less than or equal to 0, `s` is `p[s] - n`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]` `n` times, `bp` is increased by `a[b]` `n` times, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, and `bm` is not greater than `sm`**
