Output State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `k` is 0, `bm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `s` is the result of `p[s] - 1` after the last iteration, `sm` is the maximum value it attained during any iteration of the loop, `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` after the last iteration, `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` after the last iteration, `b` is the result of `p[b] - 1` after the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The variable `k` will be 0 since it is decremented until it reaches 0. The variable `bm` will hold the maximum value it achieved during any iteration, which is calculated as `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`. Similarly, `sm` will also hold the maximum value it achieved during any iteration, calculated as `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. The variable `sp` will be the cumulative sum of `a[s]` after the last iteration, and `bp` will be the cumulative sum of `a[b]` after the last iteration. Both `b` and `s` will be adjusted according to the loop's logic after all iterations.
