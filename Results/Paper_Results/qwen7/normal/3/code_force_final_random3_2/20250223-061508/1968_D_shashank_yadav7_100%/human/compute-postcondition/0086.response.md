Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `k` is decreased by 1.
   - `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`.
   - `s` is `p[s] - 1`.
   - `sm` is updated to the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.
   - `sp` is `sp + a[s] + a[s]`.
   - `bp` is `bp + a[b] + a[b]`.
   - `b` is `p[b] - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains the same (must be greater than 0).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**.
