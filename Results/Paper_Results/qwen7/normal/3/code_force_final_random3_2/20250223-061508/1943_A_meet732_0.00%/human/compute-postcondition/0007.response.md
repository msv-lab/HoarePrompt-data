Output State: **`i` is the second element of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is now 2**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Since initially `cntl[i]` was 1, after executing `cntl[i] += 1`, the value of `cntl[i]` becomes 2. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
