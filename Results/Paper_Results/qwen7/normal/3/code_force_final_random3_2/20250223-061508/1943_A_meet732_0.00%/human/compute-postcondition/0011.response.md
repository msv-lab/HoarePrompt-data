Output State: The list `cntl` will have each element set to the count of how many times the corresponding index appears in the list `a`. Specifically, if the value `i` appears `x` times in the list `a`, then `cntl[i]` will be `x`. All other elements in `cntl` will remain 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cntl` will contain the frequency count of each integer present in the list `a`, with the counts starting from index 0 up to the maximum value found in `a`.
