Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `i` is assigned the value of each element in the list `a` sequentially.
   - For each iteration, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` must have at least one element.
   - The first element of `a` is assigned to `i`.
   - `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is assigned the first element of `a` in the first iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be assigned the second element of `a`.
   - `cntl[i]` (where `i` is now the second element) will be incremented by 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - `i` will be the second element of `a`.
   - `cntl[i]` (where `i` is the second element) will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` must have at least one element, `i` is the second element of `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1**.
