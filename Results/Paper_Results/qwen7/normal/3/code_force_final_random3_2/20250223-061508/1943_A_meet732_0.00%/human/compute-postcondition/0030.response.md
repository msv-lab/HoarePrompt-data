Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `j` is set to 2.
2. `cntl[2]` is mentioned to be less than or equal to 0, but this information is not needed to determine what will be printed by the `print(j)` statement.

Given that the only variable being printed is `j`, and its value is explicitly stated to be 2, we can directly substitute this value into the print statement.

Output: **2**
