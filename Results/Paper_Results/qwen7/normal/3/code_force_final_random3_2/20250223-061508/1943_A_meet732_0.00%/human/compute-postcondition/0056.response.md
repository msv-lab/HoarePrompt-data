Output State: The list `cntl` will have its elements incremented by 1 for each unique integer present in the list `a`. After all iterations of the loop, `cntl[i]` will represent how many times the integer `i` appeared in the list `a`.

In Natural Language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the `cntl` list will contain counts for each unique integer found in the list `a`. Each element in `cntl` will be incremented by 1 for every occurrence of the corresponding index (integer) in `a`. The final state of `cntl` will reflect the frequency of each integer in `a`.
