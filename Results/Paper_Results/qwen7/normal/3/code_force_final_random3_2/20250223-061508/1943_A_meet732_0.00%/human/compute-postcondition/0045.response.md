Postcondition: **The list `cntl` will have each element set to the count of how many times the corresponding index appears in the list `a`. Specifically, if the value `i` appears `x` times in the list `a`, then `cntl[i]` will be `x`. All other elements in `cntl` will remain 0. Additionally, if `cntl[0]` is equal to 0, the function does nothing. Otherwise, the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `j` is 2. The variable `c` is 0, and `cntl[2]` is less than or equal to 0. The loop has broken out due to the condition `not c or j == n` being true.**
