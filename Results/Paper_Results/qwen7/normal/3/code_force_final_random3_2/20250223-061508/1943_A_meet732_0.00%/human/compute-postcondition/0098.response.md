Output State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `a` must have at least two elements, `i` is the third element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. The initial state specifies that `a` must have at least two elements, and `i` is the third element of `a`. These conditions remain true after the code execution, but the exact value of `cntl[i]` is not specified in the initial state, so we only know it has been incremented by 1.
