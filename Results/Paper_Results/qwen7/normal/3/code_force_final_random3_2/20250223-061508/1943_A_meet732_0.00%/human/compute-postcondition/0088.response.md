Postcondition: **The list `cntl` will show the frequency of each number in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` was 0, then for each integer `i` in `a`, the corresponding index `i` in `cntl` will be incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `i` in `a`. The loop will terminate when `a` is empty or `j` equals `n`. If the `if` condition is not met, then after the loop, `j` will be equal to `n`, `c` will be 0, and `cntl[j]` will be less than 2 for all `j` from 1 to `n`.**
