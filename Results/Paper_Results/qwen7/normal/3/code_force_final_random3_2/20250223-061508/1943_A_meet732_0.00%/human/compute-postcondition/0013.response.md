Based on the initial state described:

- The list `cntl` is initialized such that each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the index `i` appears in the list `a`. 
- All elements in `cntl` except `cntl[0]` are set to 0.
- `cntl[0]` is explicitly stated to be 0.

The `print(0)` statement simply prints the integer 0.

Output: **0**
