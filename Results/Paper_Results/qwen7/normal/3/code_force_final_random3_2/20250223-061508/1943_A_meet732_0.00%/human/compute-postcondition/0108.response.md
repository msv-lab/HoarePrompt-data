Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cntl[j]` is less than or equal to 1, `c` is one less than its original value.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1. Since `c` was not given an initial value in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value, but we know it is now one less than it was before. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
