Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `cntl[j]` is less than or equal to 1.
   - If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, we break out of the loop.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Since `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition depends on `j` being within the range `[1, n]`, and there's no indication that `n` changes within the loop.
   - The condition `cntl[j] <= 1` still needs to hold true for `j = 2`. However, since we are only adjusting the state for the loop to execute one more time, we don't need to explicitly state this condition unless it changes.
   - The break condition (`c == 0 or j == n`) will be checked again with the new value of `j`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - The condition `cntl[2] <= 1` is implied but not explicitly stated as it is a loop invariant.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0**
