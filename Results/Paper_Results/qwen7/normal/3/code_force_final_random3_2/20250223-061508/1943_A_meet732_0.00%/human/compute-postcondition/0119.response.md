Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: `j` is 2; `c` is decreased by 1.
   - This means `j` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `c` is mentioned but its value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement, as it does not affect the print statement itself.

2. The print statement is `print(j)`.
   - Since `j` is explicitly given as 2, the print statement will output the value of `j`.

Output: **2**
