Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides us with the following information:
   - `j` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `n` must be at least 1 (though its exact value is not specified).
   - `cntl[j]` is less than 1. Since `j` is 1, this means `cntl[1]` is less than 1.
   - Either `c` is False or `j` equals `n`. Given that `j` is 1, this implies that `c` must be False (since `j` does not equal `n`).

2. The print statement is `print(j)`, which simply outputs the value of `j`.

3. From the initial state, we know `j` is explicitly set to 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **1**
