Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as there is input available from `input()`. The number of iterations is determined by the value returned by `int(input())`.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that there is valid input available for `int(input())` to return a positive integer. Since `t` is the expected input, the loop will execute `t` times.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring that it is within the specified range and that it will provide valid input for the loop to execute.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)

So, the final state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**
