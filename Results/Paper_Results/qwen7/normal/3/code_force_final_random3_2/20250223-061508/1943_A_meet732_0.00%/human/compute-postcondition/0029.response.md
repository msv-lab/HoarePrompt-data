Output State: **`j` is 2, `cntl[2]` is less than or equal to 0**

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1. Given the initial condition that `cntl[2]` is less than or equal to 1, after decrementing `c` by 1, `cntl[2]` will now be less than or equal to 0. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 2, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is not affected by this line of code.
