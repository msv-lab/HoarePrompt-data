Postcondition: **The variable `cntl` will have been updated such that for each index `i` present in the list `a`, the value at `cntl[i]` will be equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`. All other elements in `cntl` (those indices not present in `a`) will remain as 0. The list `a` will remain unchanged from its initial state. Additionally, the condition `cntl[0] == 0` is true.**
