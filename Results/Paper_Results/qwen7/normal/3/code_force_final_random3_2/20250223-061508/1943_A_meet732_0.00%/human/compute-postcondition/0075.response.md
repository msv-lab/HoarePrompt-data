Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, `c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified, the `break` statement simply exits the context it was in, which is implied to be the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `j`, `n`, `cntl[2]`, and `c` remain unchanged.
