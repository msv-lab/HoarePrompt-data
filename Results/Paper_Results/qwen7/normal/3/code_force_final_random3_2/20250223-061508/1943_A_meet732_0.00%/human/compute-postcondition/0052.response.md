Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in a:` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the iterable `a` (i.e., `a` is not empty).

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `cntl[i]` is increased by 1.
   - This implies that `i` is an index into the `cntl` array, and its value has been incremented.

4. **Next Iteration State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still contain elements. Since `i` is being iterated over from `a`, the next value of `i` will be the next element in `a`.
   - Therefore, `a` should not be empty, and `i` should be set to the next element in `a`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `a` must still contain elements for the loop to execute again.
- `i` will be set to the next element in `a`.

Since the exact value of `i` at the start of the next iteration is dependent on the contents of `a`, we cannot specify it precisely without knowing `a`. However, we know that `i` will be the next element in `a`.

**Final State**:
State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `a` must not be empty, `i` is the next element in `a`**
