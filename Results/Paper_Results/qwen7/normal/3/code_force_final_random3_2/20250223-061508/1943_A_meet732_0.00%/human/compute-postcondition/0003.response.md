Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `cntl` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new list `cntl` is created and initialized to all zeros.
