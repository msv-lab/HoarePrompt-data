Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `z` is 3**

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated by adding to its current value the result of `z // (k - 1) + 1`. Given that `z` is initially 1, `z // (k - 1)` would be 0 (since `k - 1` is at least 0 and division by a positive number results in 0 when the numerator is less than the denominator), and thus `z // (k - 1) + 1` equals 1. Therefore, `z` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`. However, since the initial state also includes `z` being 1, and the operation modifies `z` to 2, and given no other operations affect `i` or `x`, the final state is `i` is 1, `x` is greater than `k - 1`, and `z` is 3.
