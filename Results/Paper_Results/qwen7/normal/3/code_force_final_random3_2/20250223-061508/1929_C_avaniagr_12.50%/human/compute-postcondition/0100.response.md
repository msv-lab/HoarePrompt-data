Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies parameters t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), k (an integer between 2 and 30), x (an integer between 1 and 100), and a (an integer between 1 and 10^9). It returns an error message if t is less than 1 or greater than 1000, k is less than 2 or greater than 30, x is less than 1 or greater than 100, or a is less than 1 or greater than 10^9. Otherwise, it does not explicitly return anything from the given information.**
