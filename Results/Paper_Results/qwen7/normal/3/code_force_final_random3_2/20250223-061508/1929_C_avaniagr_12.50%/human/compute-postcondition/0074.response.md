Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is defined as `t - 1`, which means `t` is one less than its original value.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are input integers, but their specific values are not given.

The print statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Output: **YES**
