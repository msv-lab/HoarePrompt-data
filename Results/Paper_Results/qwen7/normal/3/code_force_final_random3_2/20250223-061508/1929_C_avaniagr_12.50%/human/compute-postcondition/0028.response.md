Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `x` is greater than `k - 1`
   - `z` is 1

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 1) must still be less than `x + 1`. Therefore, `x` must be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `x` must still be greater than `k - 1`.
   - `z` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `z` is 1**
