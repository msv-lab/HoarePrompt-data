Postcondition: `t` is `t - 1`, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `z` is 8. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, `z` remains 8. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, no changes are made. If `x` is greater than `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, no changes are made. If `x` is greater than `k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, `z` remains 8.
