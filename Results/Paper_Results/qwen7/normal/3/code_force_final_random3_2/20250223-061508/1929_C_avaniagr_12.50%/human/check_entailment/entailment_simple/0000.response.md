### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Conditions for Printing 'YES' or 'NO'**:
   - The program checks different conditions based on the values of `k` and `x`:
     - If `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 3`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates `z` using a loop and checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

3. **Calculation of `z`**:
   - The variable `z` is calculated in the loop where `z` is updated as `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` iterations.
   - This calculation is intended to determine the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can win any number of coins given the constraints.

4. **Analysis of Conditions**:
   - The conditions in the program are designed to check if Sasha can achieve the goal of having any number of coins (`n`) under the given constraints.
   - The logic seems to cover the basic scenarios:
     - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can recover from one loss quickly enough.
     - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs to recover from two consecutive losses.
     - If `x > k - 1`, Sasha needs a larger buffer to ensure he can recover from `x` consecutive losses.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve the goal of having any number of coins under the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
