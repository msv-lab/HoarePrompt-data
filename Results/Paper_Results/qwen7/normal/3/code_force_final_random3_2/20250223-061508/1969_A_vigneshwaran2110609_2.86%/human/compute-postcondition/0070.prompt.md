Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 50, `x` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 50, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, x):
    if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
        flag = True
        print(2)
        break
else:
    print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of the list `l`. If the element at index `l[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is set to True. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of the list `l`. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition is not met, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of the list `l`, `x` is the upper limit of the range, and `flag` remains unchanged. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
