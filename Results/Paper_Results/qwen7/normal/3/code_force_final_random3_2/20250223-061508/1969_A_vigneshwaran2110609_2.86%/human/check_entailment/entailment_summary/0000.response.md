Reasoning:
- The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.
- Specifically, the program checks if there exists any friend `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. This condition checks if a friend and their best friend both receive invitations, which is only one pair. However, the problem requires at least 2 friends to come to the party, and the solution should find the minimum number of invitations needed to achieve this.
- In the provided code, if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is met for any `i`, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. This is incorrect because it does not guarantee that at least 2 friends will come to the party. Similarly, if the condition is never met, it prints `3`, which might not always be the correct answer either.
- The correct approach would involve identifying cycles in the friendship graph and ensuring that at least one cycle of length 2 or more is fully covered with invitations.

Correctness: **False**
