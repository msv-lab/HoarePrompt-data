Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations without breaking out of the inner if statement, meaning that for every iteration from 0 to n-1, the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was never met for any i in the range of x. Therefore, the print statement inside the else block executed for all iterations, resulting in the number 3 being printed for each iteration.

In terms of variable values:
- `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which means it will be 49 since the loop ran for all iterations.
- `x` will be the last value it took during the loop, which is 50 based on the given information.
- `flag` will remain unchanged or will be False because the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was never satisfied for any i in the range of x.

So, the final output state is:
- `i` is 49
- `x` is 50
- `flag` is False
