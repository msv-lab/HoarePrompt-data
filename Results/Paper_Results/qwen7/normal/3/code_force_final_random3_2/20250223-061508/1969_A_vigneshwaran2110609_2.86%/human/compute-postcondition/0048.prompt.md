Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 50, `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an input integer, `flag` remains unchanged or is True if any `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1` for any `i` in the range of `x`, `l` is a list of integers created from user input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, x):
    if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
        flag = True
        print(2)
        break
else:
    print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `x` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive). If the first element of list `l` is equal to 0, then the variable `flag` is set to `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first element of list `l` is not equal to 0, then no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive), and `flag` is True because either `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no other condition to change the state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive), and `flag` is True. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
