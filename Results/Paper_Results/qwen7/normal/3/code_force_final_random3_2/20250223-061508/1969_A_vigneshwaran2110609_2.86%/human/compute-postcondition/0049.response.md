Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop variables involved are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 49
   - `x` is 50
   - `flag` is True

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 49.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 50.
   - Since `i` is now 50, `n` must be greater than 50 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` becomes 50.
   - `n` must be greater than 50.
   - The values of `x` and `flag` remain unchanged since they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 50, `x` is 50, and `n` must be greater than 50**.
