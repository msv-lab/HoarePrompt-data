Output State: **`i` is 2, `not_mid` is greater than 0, `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `big_element - 1`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is equal to `clique`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to be equal to `clique`. Given that `i` was initially 1 + 1 (which is 2), the updated value of `i` remains 2. All other variables retain their initial conditions as specified in the initial state.
