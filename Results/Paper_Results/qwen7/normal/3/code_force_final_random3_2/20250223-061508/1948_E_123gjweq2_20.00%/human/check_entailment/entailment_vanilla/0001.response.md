Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes `n` and `k` as input.
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with zeros.
   - It then calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.
   - Finally, it prints the contents of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the contents of `cliquess`.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as input.
   - It calculates the middle index `mid` and the number of elements not in the middle `not_mid`.
   - It fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` with values from `small_element` to `big_element` such that the middle half of the array gets the smaller values and the rest get the larger values.
   - It assigns the `clique` value to all elements in the array.

### Key Points to Check:

1. **Assignment of Values**:
   - The assignment of values in `arr` and `cliquess` seems to follow a pattern where the first half of the array gets smaller values and the second half gets larger values. However, this does not necessarily ensure that the graph will be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The problem requires that for every pair of vertices `(i, j)`, an edge is added if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   - The current implementation does not check if the constructed graph meets this condition. Instead, it simply assigns values to the vertices and assumes the graph will be correctly partitioned into cliques.

3. **Partitioning into Cliques**:
   - The partitioning logic in `make_array` assigns the same `clique` value to all elements within a certain range. This does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 4`, the partitioning logic might not produce the optimal solution.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that the graph is constructed according to the given conditions (`|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`). Additionally, the partitioning logic does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
