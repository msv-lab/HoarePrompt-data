The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2*n inclusive. It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and fills an array `arr` using the `make_array` function based on the calculated cliques. The function then prints the filled array `arr`, the number of cliques, and another array `cliquess` containing the clique sizes.
