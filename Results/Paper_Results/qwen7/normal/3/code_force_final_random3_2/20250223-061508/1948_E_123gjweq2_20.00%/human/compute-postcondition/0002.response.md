Output State: **`left` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `right` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier; `small_element` is left + 1; `big_element` is right + 1; `mid` is ((right + 1) - (left + 1)) // 2.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` between `small_element` and `big_element`. Since `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is computed as `((right + 1) - (left + 1)) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
