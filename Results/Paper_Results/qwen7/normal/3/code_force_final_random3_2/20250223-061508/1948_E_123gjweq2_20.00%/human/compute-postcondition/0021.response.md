Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `not_mid`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `not_mid`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `not_mid` is greater than 0
   - `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `clique`
   - `arr[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `big_element - 1`
   - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is equal to `clique`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`. Therefore, `i` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be 3) must still be less than `not_mid`. Since `not_mid` is greater than 0, it must remain greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 3.
   - `not_mid` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - The other states (`cliquess[left + mid + 1]`, `arr[left + mid + 1]`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not depend on the loop variable `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `not_mid` is greater than 0, `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `big_element - 1`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is equal to `clique***.
