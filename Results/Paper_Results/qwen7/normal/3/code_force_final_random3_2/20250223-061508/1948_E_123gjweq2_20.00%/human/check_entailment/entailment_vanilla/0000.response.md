Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to each vertex.
   - For each pair of vertices \((i, j)\), an edge is added between them if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques.

2. **Given Code:**
   - The code defines a function `func_1` which attempts to solve the problem.
   - It also defines a helper function `make_array`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)` calculates the number of cliques needed.
   - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized as lists of zeros.
   - A loop runs from 0 to `cliques - 1`, and for each iteration, `make_array` is called to fill the arrays.

4. **Function `make_array`:**
   - This function fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` based on the given parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - It splits the range `[left, right]` into two parts and assigns elements accordingly.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cliques:**
   - The calculation of `cliques` as `ceil(n / k)` might not always result in the optimal number of cliques. The problem requires minimizing the number of cliques, but this approach does not guarantee the minimum.

2. **Incorrect Assignment Logic:**
   - The `make_array` function logic seems to split the range into two parts and assign values, but it does not ensure that the resulting graph meets the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

3. **Lack of Verification:**
   - There is no verification to check if the generated assignment satisfies the condition for adding edges.

4. **No Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where the conditions for forming cliques cannot be satisfied with the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. It does not ensure that the graph formed meets the required conditions and does not minimize the number of cliques effectively.

**Correctness: False**
