Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the constants `left` and `mid`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < mid`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` will increment by 1.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cliquess[left + i]` is set to the value of `clique`.
   - `arr[left + i]` is equal to `small_element + i`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the next state for `cliquess[left + i]` will be `cliquess[left + (i + 1)]` and it will be set to the value of `clique`.
   - Similarly, the next state for `arr[left + i]` will be `arr[left + (i + 1)]` and it will be equal to `small_element + (i + 1)`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `cliquess[left + i]` becomes `cliquess[left + (i + 1)]`.
   - `arr[left + i]` becomes `arr[left + (i + 1)]`.

6. **Final State**:
   - `cliquess[left + (i + 1)]` is set to the value of `clique`.
   - `arr[left + (i + 1)]` is equal to `small_element + (i + 1)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`cliquess[left + (i + 1)]` is set to the value of `clique'; `arr[left + (i + 1)]` is equal to `small_element + (i + 1)`**.
