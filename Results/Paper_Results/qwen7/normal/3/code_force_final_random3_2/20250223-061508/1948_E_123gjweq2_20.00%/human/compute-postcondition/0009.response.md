Output State: **`cliquess[left + i]' is set to the value of `clique'; `arr[left + i]' is equal to `small_element + i'.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cliquess[left + i]` to be equal to the value of `clique`. Additionally, it sets the value of `arr[left + i]` to be `small_element + i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
