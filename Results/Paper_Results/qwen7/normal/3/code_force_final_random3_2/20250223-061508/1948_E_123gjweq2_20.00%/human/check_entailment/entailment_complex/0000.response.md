Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires assigning distinct integers to vertices such that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques, where a clique is a complete subgraph.
2. **Key Points**:
   - The number of cliques is determined by `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The `make_array` function is responsible for filling the array `arr` and the corresponding `cliquess` array based on the specified parameters.
   - The `func_1` function initializes arrays and calls `make_array` to populate them.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)` correctly calculates the number of cliques.
   - The `make_array` function is called for each clique, ensuring that the elements within each segment of the array fall into the correct clique.
   - The `arr` array is populated such that elements within each segment are distinct and ordered.
   - The `cliquess` array correctly assigns each element to the appropriate clique.

4. **Analysis of `make_array`**:
   - The function correctly divides the range `[left, right]` into two segments.
   - The first segment is filled with increasing values starting from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
   - The second segment is filled with decreasing values starting from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element - 1`.
   - Both segments are assigned the correct clique identifier.

5. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program logic correctly partitions the vertices into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
