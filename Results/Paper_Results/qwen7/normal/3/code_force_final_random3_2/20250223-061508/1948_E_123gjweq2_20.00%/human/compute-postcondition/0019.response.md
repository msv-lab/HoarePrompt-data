Output State: **`i` is 1 + 1, `not_mid` is greater than 0, `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `big_element - 1`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is equal to `big_element - i`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing the code, `i` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
