Output State: **`i` is 0; `not_mid` is greater than 0; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is equal to `clique`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is equal to `big_element - i`.**

Explanation: The line of code `cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique` assigns the value of `clique` to the index `left + mid + i` of the list `cliquess`. Since `i` is 0, the index simplifies to `left + mid`. The value of `arr[left + mid + i]` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. The other variables (`i` and `not_mid`) also remain unchanged.
