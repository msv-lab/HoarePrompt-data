Output State: **All elements in the array `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to values ranging from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`. The corresponding elements in the `cliquess` array are all set to the value of `clique`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the elements in the array `arr` between indices `left` and `left + mid - 1` will be filled with consecutive integers starting from `small_element`, incrementing by 1 for each subsequent index. Simultaneously, the `cliquess` array will have the same value (`clique`) stored in all positions from `left` to `left + mid - 1`.
