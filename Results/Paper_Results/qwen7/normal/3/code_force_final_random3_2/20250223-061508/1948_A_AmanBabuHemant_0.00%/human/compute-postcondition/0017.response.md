Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an integer. If `n` is odd, then `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is even, then `s` is set to '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, no further action is taken. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, `s` is adjusted to have a length of exactly 200.
