You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: t must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is either '110' repeated `n // 2` times (if `n % 2` is not true) or remains unchanged from the precondition.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an integer \( n \). For each \( n \), it checks if \( n \) is even. If \( n \) is even, it constructs a string consisting of '110' repeated \( n/2 \) times. If the length of this string is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If \( n \) is odd, it directly prints 'NO'. The function implicitly accepts two integers \( t \) and \( n \) through user input, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 50 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq 50 \), and it does not return any value explicitly but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a string of length at most 200 with exactly `n` special characters.
   - A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func()` takes input for `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the required number of special characters.
   - It checks if `n` is odd:
     - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because we cannot form a string where every character is a special character if `n` is odd.
     - If `n` is even, it tries to construct a string using the pattern `'110' * (n // 2)`.
       - This pattern ensures that every third character is different from its neighbors, making it a special character.
       - The constructed string `s` is checked to ensure its length is less than 200. If so, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed string. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Checking the Correctness:**
   - The logic for handling odd `n` is correct since it correctly identifies that no such string can exist for odd `n`.
   - For even `n`, the pattern `'110' * (n // 2)` will indeed create a string where every third character is a special character. However, this pattern does not guarantee that all characters will be special.
   - To ensure that every character is a special character, we need to ensure that each character is equal to exactly one neighbor. The pattern `'110'` does not achieve this for all positions in the string.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For `n = 6`, the pattern `'110' * 3` results in "110110". This string has 4 special characters (positions 2, 3, 4, 5), not 6.
   - For `n = 1`, the pattern `'110'` does not work since it requires at least 3 characters.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly generate a string with exactly `n` special characters for all valid `n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
