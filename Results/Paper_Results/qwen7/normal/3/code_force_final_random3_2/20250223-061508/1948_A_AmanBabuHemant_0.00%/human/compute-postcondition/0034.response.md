Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 48.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is '110' repeated `n // 2` times.

We need to determine what will be printed when the `print(s)` statement executes.

First, let's break down the value of `s`:
- `s` is constructed by repeating the string '110' `n // 2` times.
- Since `n` is an integer, `n // 2` will give us the number of times '110' is repeated.

For example, if `n = 6`, then `n // 2 = 3`, so `s` would be `'110110110'`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only describe `s` in terms of `n`.

Therefore, the output will be the string '110' repeated `n // 2` times.

Output: **'110' repeated [n // 2] times**
