Reasoning:
- The problem requires constructing a string with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- The provided solution attempts to construct such a string using the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that every third character is different from its neighbors, making it a candidate for having special characters.
- However, the solution has a flaw in how it determines the number of special characters. The pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times will have fewer than `n` special characters unless `n` is a multiple of 3. For other values of `n`, the pattern will not meet the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.
- The solution correctly handles the case when `n` is odd by printing 'NO', but it incorrectly assumes that repeating '110' will always produce the required number of special characters for even `n`.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
