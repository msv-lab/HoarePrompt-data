Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - If `n` is odd, `n` remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is even, `n` is treated as an even integer, and `s` is set to '110' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - If the length of `s` is less than 200, `s` remains as calculated.
   - If the length of `s` is 200 or more, `s` is adjusted to have exactly 200 characters.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `_` is used, but it is not relevant for adjusting the states.
   - The loop itself depends on the value of `t`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop iterates based on `t`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.
   - After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

5. **New State:**
   - `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value (which was greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50).

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 49, `n` is an integer.**
