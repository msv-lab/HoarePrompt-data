Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an even integer, and `s` is '110' repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, the function does nothing additional. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, the function ensures that `s` has a length of exactly 200.
