Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an integer \( n \). For each \( n \), it checks if \( n \) is even. If \( n \) is even, it constructs a string consisting of '110' repeated \( n/2 \) times. If the length of this string is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If \( n \) is odd, it directly prints 'NO'. The function implicitly accepts two integers \( t \) and \( n \) through user input, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 50 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq 50 \), and it does not return any value explicitly but prints the results for each test case.**
