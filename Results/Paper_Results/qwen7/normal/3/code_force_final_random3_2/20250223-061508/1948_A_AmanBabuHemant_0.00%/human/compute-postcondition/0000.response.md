Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 50`, the value of `t` after executing the code remains within this range. The variable `n` is not defined or affected by this code, so its initial state remains unchanged.
