Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0, and after the execution of the if else block, if `a[i] > a[k - 1]` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]` is false, the same conditions apply and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
