Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial conditions and the fact that no variables are reassigned or altered by the `break` statement, these conditions remain unchanged.
