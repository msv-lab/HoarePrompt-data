You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is 3, `i` is 9999, `n` is 10000, and `t`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values or states as they were not affected by the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: Given that the loop increments `wins` as long as `a[i]` is less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, and it stops when `a[i]` becomes greater than `a[k - 1]` or when `i` reaches `n`. The loop executed 3 times, meaning `i` was incremented up to 2. Since `n` is at least 2 (as per the given constraints), `i` can go up to `n-1`, which in the worst case would be 9999 if `n` is 10000. Therefore, after all iterations, `wins` will be 3, `i` will be 9999 (assuming `n` is 10000), and `t`, `k`, and `a` will remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: 2
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `wins` is 3, `i` is 9999, `n` is 10000, and `t`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values or states as they were not affected by the loop, and `wins` is less than `k`
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is 10000, `i` is 9999.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `win_with_swap` (which starts at 4) to `k-1` (where `k` is 10000), incrementing `win_with_swap` each time. Since `i` starts at 9999 and the loop increments `win_with_swap` without changing `i`, `i` remains 9999 throughout the loop. The loop will continue to run until `win_with_swap` reaches `k-1`, which is 9999 in this case. Given that the loop increments `win_with_swap` 9996 times (from 4 to 10000), it will execute exactly 9996 times. Therefore, `wins` will be 10000 after the loop completes all its iterations, and `i` will still be 9999.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: 9999
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
