You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

    win_with_swap = wins + 1

        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break

- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers `n` and `k` followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. It then counts how many elements in `a` are less than or equal to the `k-1`th element of `a`. If this count (`wins`) is at least `k`, it prints `wins - 1` and returns. Otherwise, it calculates another count (`win_with_swap`) by considering a potential swap with the `k-1`th element and prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`. The function ultimately returns `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of matches cow `k` can win.
   - We can either do nothing or swap cow `k` with another cow before the tournament starts.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of wins for cow `k`.

2. **Initial Analysis of the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cows) and `k` (index of the cow we own).
   - It then reads the ratings of the cows.
   - The program calculates the number of wins without any swaps (`wins`).
   - If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints `wins - 1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of wins with a potential swap (`win_with_swap`).
   - Finally, it prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Without Swap (`wins`):**
     - The program iterates through the ratings and counts how many cows have a higher rating than the cow at position `k-1`.
     - This count gives the number of matches the cow at position `k-1` can win without any swaps.
   - **With Swap (`win_with_swap`):**
     - The program checks if swapping cow `k` with another cow can increase the number of wins.
     - It iterates from `win_with_swap` to `k-1` and counts how many cows have a higher rating than the cow at position `k-1` after the swap.
     - The logic here seems to be flawed because it does not correctly account for the position changes due to the swap.

4. **Flaw in the Logic:**
   - The current implementation of `win_with_swap` does not correctly simulate the effect of swapping cow `k` with another cow.
   - The logic for `win_with_swap` should consider the new position of cow `k` after the swap and re-evaluate the number of wins based on this new position.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the maximum number of wins with a potential swap. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
