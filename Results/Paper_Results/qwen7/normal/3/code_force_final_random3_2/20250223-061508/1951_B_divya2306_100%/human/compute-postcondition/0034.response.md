Output State: **`wins` is 5, `i` is less than or equal to `k - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `i` was being incremented. The value of `wins` remains unchanged at 5, and the condition `i` is less than `k - 1` changes to `i` is less than or equal to `k - 1` because `i` was incremented by 1 before the `break` statement was executed.
