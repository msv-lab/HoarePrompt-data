Output State: `wins` is 10000, `i` is 9999.

Explanation: The loop runs from `win_with_swap` (which starts at 4) to `k-1` (where `k` is 10000), incrementing `win_with_swap` each time. Since `i` starts at 9999 and the loop runs until `win_with_swap` reaches 10000, it will execute exactly 9996 times (from 4 to 10000 inclusive). During each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 but does not change the value of `i` itself since it is not used in the loop body. Therefore, after all iterations, `wins` will be 10000 and `i` will remain 9999.
