Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; n and k are assigned the values from input.split();**

In this state, the variable `t` retains its original value as an integer between 1 and 10^4. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned new values from the input split, with `n` being an integer between 2 and 10^5 and `k` being an integer between 1 and `n`. The list `a` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the given code snippet.
