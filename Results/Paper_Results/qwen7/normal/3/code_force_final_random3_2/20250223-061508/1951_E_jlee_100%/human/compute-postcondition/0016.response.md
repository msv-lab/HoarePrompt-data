Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing characters from `string`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `x` is the first character of list `s`, and `done` is False. We continue the loop or statement we were inside.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only moves the control flow to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same as their initial states.
