Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, and `count` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `done = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `done`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, or `count`. Therefore, the values of `j`, `n`, and `count` remain unchanged, and `done` is explicitly set to `True`.
