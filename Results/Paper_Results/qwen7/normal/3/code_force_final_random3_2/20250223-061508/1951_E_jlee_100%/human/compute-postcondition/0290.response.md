Output State: **`j` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, `done` is `True`, `count` is `n-1`, `count2` remains unchanged**

Explanation: The line `done = True` does not affect any of the other variables. It only changes the value of `done` to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values as per the initial state.
