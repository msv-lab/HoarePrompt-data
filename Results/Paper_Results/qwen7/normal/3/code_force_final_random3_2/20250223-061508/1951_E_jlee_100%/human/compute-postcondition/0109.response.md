Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `done` is True if `s[1]` is not equal to the character at index `n - 2` in string `s`. Otherwise, `done` remains as it was.**

This postcondition summarizes the state after the if-else block executes. If the condition `s[1] != s[n - 1 - 1]` is true, then `done` becomes True. Otherwise, `done` retains its previous value.
