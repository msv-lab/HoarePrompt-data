Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`**.

Explanation: The line `count2 = 0` initializes a new variable `count2` to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions from the initial state.
