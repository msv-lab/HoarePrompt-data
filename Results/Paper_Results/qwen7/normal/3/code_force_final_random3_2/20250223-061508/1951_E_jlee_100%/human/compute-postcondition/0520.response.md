Based on the initial state provided, we know that:

- `done` is `True`.
- `count` is equal to `j`, where `j` is such that the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `done`, `count`, `j`, or any other variables. Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
