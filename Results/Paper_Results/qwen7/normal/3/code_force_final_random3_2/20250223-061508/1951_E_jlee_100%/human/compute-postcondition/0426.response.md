Output State: **`done` is `True`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is `j` and its current value is greater than `0`, `count2` is `0` and its current value is less than `j`, `n` must be greater than `0`.**

Explanation: The line `done = True` sets the variable `done` to `True`, which changes its value from `False` to `True`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions as described in the initial state.
