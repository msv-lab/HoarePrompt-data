Output State: **`done` becomes `False` and `count` remains `count`, `count2` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `count2` to 0. Since the initial postcondition for `done` and `count` is given, and no operations are performed on `done` or `count` within the code snippet, `done` remains `False` and `count` remains unchanged. `count2` is specifically set to 0.
