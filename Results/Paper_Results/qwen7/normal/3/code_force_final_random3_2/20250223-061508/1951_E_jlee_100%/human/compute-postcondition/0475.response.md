Output State: **`done` remains False; `count` is equal to `j`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state or the code snippet, the variables `done` and `count` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
