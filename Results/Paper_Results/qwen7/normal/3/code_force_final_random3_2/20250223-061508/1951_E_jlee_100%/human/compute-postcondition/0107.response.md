Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `done` is True.**

Explanation: The loop condition is `j < n`. Initially, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. After the first iteration, `j` becomes 1. The `done` variable is set to `True` because the condition `s[1]` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - 1` in string `s` is met, making `done` True. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous state.
