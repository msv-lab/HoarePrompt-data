Output State: **`j` is `count + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, or `done`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement the program was currently inside. Therefore, these values remain unchanged from their initial state.
