Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`
- `done` is `True`
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count` is equal to `j`
- `count` is greater than 0
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count2` is less than `count`
- The current value of `count2` is greater than `count`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

Given that `j` is `n-1`, the first part of the string `string[:j]` will include all characters from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j`. Since `j` is `n-1`, this means it includes all characters from the start of the string up to the second-to-last character.

The second part of the string `string[j:]` will include all characters starting from the character at index `j` (which is `n-1`) to the end of the string.

Therefore, the output will be the first half of the string followed by the second half of the string.

Output: **string[:n-1], string[n-1:]**
