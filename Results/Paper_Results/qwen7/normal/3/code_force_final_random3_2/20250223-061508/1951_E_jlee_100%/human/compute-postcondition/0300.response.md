Output State: **`done` is `True`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**

Explanation: The line `done = True` sets the variable `done` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `done` is now `True`. The condition about the most internal loop or if statement being broken out remains unchanged.
