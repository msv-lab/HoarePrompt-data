Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list containing characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of list `s`.
- `x` is the first character of list `s`.
- `done` is False.
- The count of `x` in list `s` is equal to \(n - 1\).
- Either `n` is even or `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is equal to `x`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(1)
```

This statement will print the integer `1` directly.

Output: **1**
