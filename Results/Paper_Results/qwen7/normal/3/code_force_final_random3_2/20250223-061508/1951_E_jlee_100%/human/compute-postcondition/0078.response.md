Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s**.

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions specified in the initial state still hold true after the execution of the `continue` statement.
