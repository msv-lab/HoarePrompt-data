Postcondition: `done` is `True` and `count` is equal to `j`, if the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`. If the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`, the function continues the loop or iteration with `count` remaining unchanged.
