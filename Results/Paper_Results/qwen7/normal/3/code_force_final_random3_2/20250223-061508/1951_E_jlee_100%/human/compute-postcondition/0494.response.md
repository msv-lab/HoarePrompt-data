Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` becomes `True` if the character at index `j` in the list `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` and `count` is less than 1; otherwise, `done` remains `False` and `count` is equal to `j`.

This means that the slicing operation `string[:j]` will include characters from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j`, and `string[j:]` will include characters from index `j` to the end of the string.

Since `done` is `True` under the given conditions, the slicing operations will proceed without any issues, and the print statement will output the two substrings as described.

Output: **string[:j], string[j:]**
