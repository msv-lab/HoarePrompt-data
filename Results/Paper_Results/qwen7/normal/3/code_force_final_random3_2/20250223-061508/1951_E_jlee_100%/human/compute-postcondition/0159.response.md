Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, `count` is 2, `count2` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `done = True` simply reassigns the variable `done` to `True`. Since the value of `done` was already `True` in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `count`, `count2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
