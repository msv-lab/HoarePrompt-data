Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` is `True`.
- `count` is equal to `j`, where `j` is such that the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`.

Given this, the print statement `print('YES')` will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
