Output State: **`j` is equal to `n-1`, `done` is False, `count` is 2, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `t`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of all the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
