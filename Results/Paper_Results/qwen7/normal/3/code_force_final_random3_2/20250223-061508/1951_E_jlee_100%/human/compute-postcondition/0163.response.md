Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `done` is True
- `count` is 2
- `count2` is 0
- There is a condition that if `s[2]` is not equal to `s[n - 3]`, the loop or statement breaks, but since no specific value for `s` is given, we need to consider the general case where this condition does not affect the slicing of the string.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

We need to determine the slices of the string `string` based on the value of `j`.

- `j - 1` is `2 - 1`, which is `1`.
- Therefore, `string[:j - 1]` is `string[:1]`, which means it takes the substring from the start of the string up to the character at index 0 (the first character).

- `j - 1` is also `1`, so `string[j - 1:]` is `string[1:]`, which means it takes the substring starting from the character at index 1 to the end of the string.

Since the exact string `string` is not provided, we can only describe the slices in terms of their indices.

Output: **string[:1] string[1:]**
