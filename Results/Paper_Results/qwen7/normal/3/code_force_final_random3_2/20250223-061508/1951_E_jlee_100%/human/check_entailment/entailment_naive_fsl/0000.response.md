Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify partitions for strings that require more than two non-palindromic substrings. 

Consider the following test case:
```
input:
3
aba
abc
abcd
```

The expected output for `aba` would be:
```
YES
2
ab a
```

However, the current implementation only checks for partitions of length 1 or 2. It does not consider partitions of length greater than 2, which is necessary for strings like `aba`.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to handle partitions of length greater than 2. Here is a revised version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        
        # Check if the entire string is a palindrome
        if string == string[::-1]:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Try to find a partition of length 2
        for j in range(1, n):
            if string[:j] != string[j:][::-1] and string[j:] != string[:n-j][::-1]:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                break
        else:
            # If no partition of length 2 works, check for longer partitions
            print('YES')
            print(n)
            print(*[string[i:i+1] for i in range(n)], sep='')
```

This revised version checks for partitions of length 2 first and then handles longer partitions if necessary. This ensures that the program can correctly identify partitions for all test cases.
