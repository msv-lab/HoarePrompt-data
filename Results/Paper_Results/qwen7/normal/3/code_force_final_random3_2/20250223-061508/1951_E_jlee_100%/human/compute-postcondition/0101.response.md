Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and either `s[j]` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, in which case `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1. Additionally, `done` is True if `count` is greater than 1 or if `count2` is less than `count` and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`. If `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, `done` remains `False`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is less than 1, `count2` is 1, and `done` is True if the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, otherwise `done` remains `False`.
