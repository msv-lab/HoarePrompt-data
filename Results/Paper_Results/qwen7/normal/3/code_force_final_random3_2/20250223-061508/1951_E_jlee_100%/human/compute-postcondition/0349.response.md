Output State: **`count2` is 0, `j` is `count + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and the loop continues.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variable values, the values of `count2`, `j`, `n`, and the condition for `done` remain unchanged. The loop continues to execute from the beginning of the current iteration.
