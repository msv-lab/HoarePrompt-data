Output State: **`done` is `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`**.

The variable `done` is explicitly set to `False`. The values of `i`, `string`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
