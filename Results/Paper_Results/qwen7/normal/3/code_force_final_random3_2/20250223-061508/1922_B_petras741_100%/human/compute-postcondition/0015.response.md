State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. The loop `for j in range(n + 1):` will start if `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
3. Initially, `eta` is an empty list, but this does not affect the loop's execution condition.
4. The variable `j` starts at 0 as per the `range(n + 1)` function.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `j` should start at 0.
