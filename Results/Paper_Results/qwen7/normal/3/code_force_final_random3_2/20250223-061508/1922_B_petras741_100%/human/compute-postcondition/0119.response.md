Output State: **`w` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `j` is 4, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1, `q[w[4]]` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q` at the index `w[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 4, it increments `q[w[4]]` by 1. The initial state of `q[w[0]]` is already incremented by 1. Therefore, `q[w[0]]` remains incremented by 1, and now `q[w[4]]` is also incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
