Output State: **`j` is `n - 1`; `q[j]` is greater than 0; `eta` contains the value `j`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `j` is initially `n - 1` and `q[j]` is greater than 0, after executing `eta.append(j)`, `eta` will contain the value `j`. The values of `j` and `q[j]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
