#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the list a contains n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) indicating the number of cases, followed by an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then calculates and prints a specific value based on the distribution of these integers. If \( n \geq 3 \), it computes a combinatorial value related to the frequency of unique integers in the list. If \( n < 3 \), it prints 0.
