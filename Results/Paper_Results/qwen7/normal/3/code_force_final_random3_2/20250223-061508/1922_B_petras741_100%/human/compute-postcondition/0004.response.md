Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `buffer` is now a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` takes an input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `w`. The initial values of `t`, `buffer`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `buffer` becomes a list of integers from the input, `i` remains 0, and `n` remains the input integer.
