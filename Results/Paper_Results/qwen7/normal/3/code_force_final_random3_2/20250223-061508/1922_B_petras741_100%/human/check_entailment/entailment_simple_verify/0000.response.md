### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the annotated code and the logic implemented in the program to determine if it correctly counts the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle.

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of stick lengths `w`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - It initializes a list `q` to count the occurrences of each stick length from 0 to `n`.
   - It then populates this list with the counts of each stick length.

3. **Identifying Unique Stick Lengths:**
   - It creates a list `eta` containing unique stick lengths that have at least one occurrence.

4. **Triangle Counting Logic:**
   - If there is only one unique stick length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of that length and prints the result.
   - If there are multiple unique stick lengths, it iterates through these lengths and calculates the number of valid combinations that satisfy the triangle inequality conditions.

Here is the key part of the logic that needs verification:
```python
if eta_ln == 1:
    print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
else:
    res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
    for j in range(1, eta_ln):
        res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
        res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
        rho += q[eta[j]]
    print(res)
```

- **Single Unique Stick Length:**
  - If there is only one unique stick length, the program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of that length, which is correct.

- **Multiple Unique Stick Lengths:**
  - The program attempts to count the number of valid combinations by iterating through the unique stick lengths and applying the triangle inequality condition.
  - However, the program does not explicitly check the triangle inequality condition (i.e., \(a + b > c\), \(a + c > b\), and \(b + c > a\)).

Given the example provided in the original assessment:
- For the input:
  ```
  3
  2 2 3
  ```
  The program outputs `9`, but the correct output should be `1` because the only valid combination is `(2, 2, 2)`.

The program does not correctly implement the triangle inequality check, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
