Output State: `eta_ln` must be greater than `n + 3`, `j` is `n + 4`, `res` is increased by the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`, and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`, and `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `eta_ln` will be `n + 4`, `j` will be `n + 4`, `res` will include the cumulative effect of adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`, and `rho` will be incremented by `q[eta[j]]` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`.
