Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `buffer` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `buffer`. The value of `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. All other variables remain in their initial state, but since no other variables are mentioned, we only update `buffer` to reflect its new state as an empty list.
