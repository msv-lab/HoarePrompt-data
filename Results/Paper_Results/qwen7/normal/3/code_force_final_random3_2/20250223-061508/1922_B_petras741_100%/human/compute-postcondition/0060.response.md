Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the range `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variables that need to be considered for adjustment are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j = 0` (as is typical for `range(n)`), `j` should be set to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j < n`. Therefore, `n` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Initial State of `w`, `q`, and `j`**: 
   - `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `q` is a list of `n+1` elements, each initialized to 0.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` should be set to 0.
   - `n` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**
