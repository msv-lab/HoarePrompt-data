Output State: **`eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `res` is increased by `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` and then further increased by `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`**.

Explanation: The value of `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`. Given that `j` is 2, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[2]]`. The other variables (`eta_ln`, `j`, `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
