Based on the initial state provided:

- `eta_ln` must be greater than `n + 3`.
- `j` is set to `n + 4`.
- `res` is increased by the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`.
- `res` is also increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`.
- `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]` for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `j` is set to `n + 4`.
   - `eta_ln` is greater than `n + 3`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`:
     - `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`.
     - `res` is also updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.
     - `rho` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]]`.

Given these updates, the final value of `res` will be the cumulative sum of the contributions from both expressions for each `j` from `1` to `n + 3`.

Therefore, the `print(res)` statement will print the final value of `res` after all the updates have been applied.

Output: **res (where res is the cumulative sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 and q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for each j from 1 to n + 3)**
