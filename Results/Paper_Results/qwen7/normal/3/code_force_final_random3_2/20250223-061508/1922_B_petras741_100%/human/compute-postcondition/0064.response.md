Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1 (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted)

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `n` must still be greater than 1.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is as follows:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
