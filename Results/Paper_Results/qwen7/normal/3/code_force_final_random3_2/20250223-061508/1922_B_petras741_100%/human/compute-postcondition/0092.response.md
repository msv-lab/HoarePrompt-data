Output State: **`eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, `res` is increased by `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the value of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`. Initially, `j` is 1, so `eta[j]` refers to `eta[1]`. After executing the line, `j` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The precondition that `eta_ln` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
