Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`. The loop will continue as long as `j < n + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is `n`
   - `q[j]` is greater than 0
   - `eta` contains the value `[n, j]`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `n + 1`.
   - However, the loop condition `j < n + 1` means that once `j` reaches `n`, the loop will stop executing.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented from `n` to `n + 1`, but since the loop condition fails when `j` is `n + 1`, the loop will not execute again.
   - `q[j]` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `q[j]` outside the loop.
   - `eta` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` will be `n + 1`
- `q[j]` remains greater than 0
- `eta` still contains the value `[n, j]`

However, since the loop will not execute again due to the condition failing, we can summarize the final state as follows:

**State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta` contains the value `[n, j]`**.
