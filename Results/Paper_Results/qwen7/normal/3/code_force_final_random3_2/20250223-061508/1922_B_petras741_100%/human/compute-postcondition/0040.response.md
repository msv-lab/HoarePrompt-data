Output State: **`j` is 2, `eta_ln` must be at least 2, `res` is increased by `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` and then by `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`**.

Explanation: The value of `j` remains 2. The value of `eta_ln` remains at least 2. The value of `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` and then `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. The value of `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`, which is `q[eta[2]]` since `j` is 2.
