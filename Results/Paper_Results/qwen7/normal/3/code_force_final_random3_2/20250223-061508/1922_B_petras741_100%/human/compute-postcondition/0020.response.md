Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`. The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `eta` is `[0]`
   - `j` is `0`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `0`
   - If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then the function does not change `eta` and `j`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is currently `0`, the loop will continue as long as `0 < n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `1`.
   - Therefore, `n` must still be greater than or equal to `1` (since `j` starts from `0` and goes up to `n`).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `eta` remains unchanged as it was `[0]`.
   - `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `1`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`.

Thus, the updated states for the next iteration are:

**State: **`eta` is `[0]`, `j` is `1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`**.
