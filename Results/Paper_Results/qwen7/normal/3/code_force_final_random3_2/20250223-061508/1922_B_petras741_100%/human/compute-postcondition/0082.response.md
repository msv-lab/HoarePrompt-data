Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, with `j` being `n + 1`. The list `eta` contains the values `[n, n, n, ..., n]` (a list of `n + 1` elements, all being `n`).**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `j` has incremented to `n + 1`. During each iteration, when `q[j]` was greater than 0, the value of `j` was appended to the list `eta`. Since the loop ran `n + 1` times, and `j` was appended each time, the final `eta` list consists of `n + 1` occurrences of `n`.
