Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `MOD` is 1000000007; `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original `n` string to an integer; `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original `k` string to an integer; `pb` remains unchanged; `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original `ps` string to an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting another input string using `map(int, input().split())`; `pathb` is a list containing the elements `[a[pb - 1], a[pb - 1], ..., a[pb - 1]]` (where the length of the list equals the number of iterations the loop executed); `paths` is an empty list; `vis[pb - 1]` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes the `vis` list with `n` zeros and sets the element at index `pb - 1` to 1. This means that the `vis` list now has `n` zeros except for the element at the position `pb - 1`, which is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet.
