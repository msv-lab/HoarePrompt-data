Output State: **`i` is the length of `pathb`, `preb` is 0, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`**

Explanation: The code `pres += paths[i]` increments the value of `pres` by `paths[i]`. The other variables (`i`, `preb`, `pathb`, `len(paths)`, and `curr`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `pres` is now the sum of its previous value and `paths[i]`. Since `curr` was previously defined as `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, it also gets updated to reflect the new value of `pres`.
