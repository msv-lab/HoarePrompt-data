Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop iterations, and `curr` is the last computed value of `curr` within the loop. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `resb` becomes the new value of `ress`. Otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged.
