Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` is `curr`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus the last computed `pathb[i]`, `pres` is `paths[1] * k`, `i` is 2, and `curr` is `paths[0] * k`.**

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates `ress` to be the maximum value between its current value (`ress`) and the value of `curr`. Given that `curr` is `paths[0] * k`, `ress` is updated to `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
