Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of its current value and `preb + pathb[0] * k`, `i` is 3, `preb` is increased by `pathb[0] + pathb[i]`, and `curr` is `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`**.

Explanation: The code `preb += pathb[i]` increases the value of `preb` by `pathb[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `preb` is increased by `pathb[3]`. The other variables (`resb`, `i`, and `curr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
