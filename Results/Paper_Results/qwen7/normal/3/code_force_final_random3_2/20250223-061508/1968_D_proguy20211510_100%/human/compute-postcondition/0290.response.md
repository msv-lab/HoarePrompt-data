Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[0] + pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 3, `curr` is `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates `resb` to be the maximum of its current value (`resb`) and the value of `curr`. Given that `curr` is defined as `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `resb` is updated to this new value if it is greater than the current `resb`. The other variables remain unchanged.
