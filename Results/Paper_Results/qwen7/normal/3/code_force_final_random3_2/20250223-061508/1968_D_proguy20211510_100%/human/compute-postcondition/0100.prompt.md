Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All iterations of the loop have been executed. The final value of `resb` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `pathb`, `preb` will be the sum of all elements in `pathb`, and the loop condition `k < i + 1` will be false.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is the length of `pathb`, `preb` is 0, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is length_of_pathb + 1, `preb` is 0, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is pres + paths[length_of_pathb] + paths[i], `curr` is pres + paths[i] * (k - i), `ress` is the maximum of ress and curr, `ress` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`, `preb` is `0`, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
