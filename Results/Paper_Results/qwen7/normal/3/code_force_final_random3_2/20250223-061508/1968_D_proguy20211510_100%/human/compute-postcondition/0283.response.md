Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of 0 and `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[0]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `curr` is `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`**.

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum value between its current value (which is 0) and the value of `curr` (which is `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`). Since `i` is 0, `curr` simplifies to `pathb[0] * k`. Therefore, `resb` is now the maximum of 0 and `pathb[0] * k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
