Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`, `k` is updated to be `i + 1` if `k < i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`. Since `curr` is defined as `preb + pathb[3] * (k - 3)`, and `k` is updated to be `i + 1` if `k < i + 1`, the output state reflects these changes. The initial values of `preb`, `pres`, `pathb`, `i`, and `curr` remain unchanged except for the update of `k` and the assignment to `resb`.
