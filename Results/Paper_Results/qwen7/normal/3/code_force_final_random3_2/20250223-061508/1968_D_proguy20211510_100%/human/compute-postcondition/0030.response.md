Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1; `t`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `vis[ps - 1] = 1` sets the element at index `ps - 1` in the list `vis` to 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
