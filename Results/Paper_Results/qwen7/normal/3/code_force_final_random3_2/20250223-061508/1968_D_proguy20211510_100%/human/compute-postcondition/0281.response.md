Output State: **`resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `pathb` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `curr` is `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is assigned the value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. Given the initial state, `preb` is 0, `pathb` must have at least one element, and `i` is 0. Therefore, `curr` becomes `0 + pathb[0] * k`, which simplifies to `pathb[0] * k`. The values of `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, and `i` remain unchanged.
