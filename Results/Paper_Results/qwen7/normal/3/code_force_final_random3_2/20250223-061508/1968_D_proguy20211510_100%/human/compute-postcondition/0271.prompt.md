Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1, `i` is the total number of elements added to `pathb` + 1, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop iterations, `curr` is the last computed value of `curr` within the loop, `resb` is the same as the previous value if it was updated or the original value otherwise, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `pb` is the final value it takes when the loop breaks, `ps` is the integer value of the fourth element of the input split, `p` is a list containing the integers from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during the loop iterations, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis` is updated such that `vis[pb - 1]` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1, `i` is the total number of elements added to `pathb` + 1, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop iterations, `curr` is the last computed value of `curr` within the loop, `resb` is the same as the previous value if it was updated or the original value otherwise, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `pb` is the final value it takes when the loop breaks, `ps` is the integer value of the fourth element of the input split, `p` is a list containing the integers from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during the loop iterations, `paths` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]`, `vis[ps - 1]` is updated to 1, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and the condition `vis[ps - 1] == 1` is true, leading to the break of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1, `i` is the total number of elements added to `pathb` + 1, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop iterations, `curr` is the last computed value of `curr` within the loop, `resb` is the same as the previous value if it was updated or the original value otherwise, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `pb` is the final value it takes when the loop breaks, `ps` is the integer value of the fourth element of the input split, `p` is a list containing the integers from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during the loop iterations, `paths` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]` and the appended value, `vis[ps - 1]` is updated to 1, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` and now equals `p[ps - 1]`, and the condition `vis[ps - 1] == 1` remains true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `paths` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]` and the appended value `a[ps - 1]`, `vis[ps - 1]` is updated to 1, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
