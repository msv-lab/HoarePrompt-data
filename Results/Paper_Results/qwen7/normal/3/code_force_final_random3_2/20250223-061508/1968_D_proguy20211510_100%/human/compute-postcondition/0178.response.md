Output State: **`preb` is `pathb[0] + pathb[i]`, `pres` is `0`, `pathb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `2`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `resb` is `max(resb, pathb[0] * k)`**.

Explanation: The value of `preb` is updated by adding `pathb[i]` to its current value. Since `i` is initially 2, `preb` is updated to `pathb[0] + pathb[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
