Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index pb - 1 set to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is now the value of p[pb - 1], `ps` is the sum of all elements in paths, `curr` is pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths), `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the curr values calculated during the loop iterations, `pathb` is a list containing the elements [a[pb - 1]], `paths` is an empty list, and the element at index pb - 1 of vis is equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement where the assignments and updates to `vis`, `pb`, `ps`, `curr`, `ress`, `pathb`, and `paths` were taking place. The values of these variables remain unchanged except for the fact that we break out of the loop.
