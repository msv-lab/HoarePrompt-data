Output State: **`i` is length_of_pathb + 1, `preb` is 0, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is pres + paths[length_of_pathb], `curr` is pres + paths[i] * (k - i), `ress` is the maximum of ress and curr.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. Given that `i` was previously `length_of_pathb + 1`, the new value of `curr` is calculated using the updated `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
