Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1; `t`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged; `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]; paths` now contains the element `a[ps - 1]` added to it.**

Explanation: The code `ps = p[ps - 1]` updates the value of `ps` to the value at index `ps - 1` of the list `p`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The updated value of `ps` is used in the subsequent operations involving `paths`.
