Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` is 0, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus the last computed `pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 0, `curr` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop prematurely. Since the loop was not completed, the values of `resb`, `preb`, and `pres` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains 0, and `curr` remains 0. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
