Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is less than 4, `curr` is `pres + paths[3] * (k - 3)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[3]`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered by the `break` statement, the values of `i`, `k`, `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` remain as they were in the initial state. Additionally, it indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
