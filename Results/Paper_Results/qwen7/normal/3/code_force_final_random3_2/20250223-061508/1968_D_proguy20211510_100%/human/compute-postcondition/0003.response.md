Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop, often used when the variable itself is not needed within the loop body.
   - The expression `int(input())`: This is what determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `MOD` is 1000000007.
   - `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be a valid input that satisfies the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Since `t` is already defined and within the required range, we need to ensure that the input matches this range.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())`, which should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the input must be an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive**
