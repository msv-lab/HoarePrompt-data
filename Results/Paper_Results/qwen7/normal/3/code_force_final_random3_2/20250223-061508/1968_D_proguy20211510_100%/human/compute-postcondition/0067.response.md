Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of its current value and `curr`, `i` is 3, `preb` is increased by `pathb[0] + pathb[i]`, and `curr` is `preb + pathb[2] * (k - 2)`**

Explanation:
- The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3.
- The value of `preb` is updated by adding `pathb[0] + pathb[i]` to it, which is `pathb[0] + pathb[3]`.
- The value of `curr` remains unchanged as it is only used in the calculation for updating `resb`.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated `resb`, the unchanged `i`, the updated `preb`, and the unchanged `curr`.
