Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `pathb`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `preb` is `pathb[0] + pathb[i]`
   - `pres` is `0`
   - `pathb` is a list that must have at least 1 element
   - `i` is `2`
   - `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`
   - `resb` is `max(resb, curr)`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range of `len(pathb)`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration where `i` was `2`, the next value of `i` will be `3`.
   - The list `pathb` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Calculate the new values**:
   - `preb` will be updated to `pathb[0] + pathb[3]` because `i` will now be `3`.
   - `pres` remains `0` as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `curr` will be calculated based on the new `preb` and `pathb[1]`.

6. **Update the result variable**:
   - `resb` will be updated to `max(resb, curr)` if the loop body updates `resb`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be `3`.
- `preb` will be `pathb[0] + pathb[3]`.
- `pres` remains `0`.
- `pathb` remains unchanged.
- `curr` will be `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`.
- `resb` will be updated to `max(resb, curr)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `preb` is `pathb[0] + pathb[3]`, `pres` is `0`, `pathb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `3`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `resb` is `max(resb, curr)`**
