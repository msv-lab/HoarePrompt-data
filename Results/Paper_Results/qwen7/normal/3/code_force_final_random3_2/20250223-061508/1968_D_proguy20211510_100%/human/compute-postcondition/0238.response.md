Postcondition: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `i` is the length of `pathb` + 1, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop iterations, `curr` is the last computed value of `curr` within the loop, `resb` is the same as the previous value if it was updated or the original value otherwise, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the integer value of the fourth element of the input split, `p` is a list containing the integers from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `pathb` is a list with one additional element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, and the value of `vis[pb - 1]` is 1**.
