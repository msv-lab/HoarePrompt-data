Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1; `t`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged; `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`; `paths` now contains the elements `a[ps - 1]` added to it; `paths` now includes `a[ps - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. Since `ps` is already updated to `p[ps - 1]`, the new value of `paths` includes the latest element `a[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
