Based on the initial state provided:

- `resb` holds the highest value obtained from the loop's iterations.
- `ress` is initialized to 0.
- `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`.
- `pres` is initialized to 0.
- `i` is equal to the length of `pathb`.
- `curr` is the final computed value before the loop exits.
- `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`.
- The current value of `ress` is greater than the current value of `resb`.

The `print` statement in question is:

```python
print('Sasha')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
