Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 5.
   - `n` is initially set to 4.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`, meaning it will run for `i` values from `1` to `4` (inclusive).

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must start from `1` and go up to `n + 1`.
   - Given `n = 4`, the loop will run for `i` values from `1` to `4`.

5. **Adjust the initial state**:
   - Since `i` starts from `5`, we need to adjust it to `1` to ensure the loop can execute.
   - `n` remains `4` as it is already correct for the loop to run from `1` to `5`.

6. **Final state after adjustment**:
   - `total` is `0` (unchanged).
   - `i` should be `1` to start the loop.
   - `n` remains `4`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is 4**
