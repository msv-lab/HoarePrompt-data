Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values**:
   - `i` is 4 (not part of the loop head).
   - `n` is 3 (part of the loop head).
   - `j` is 2 (part of the loop head).
   - `nx` is either 'x', 'S', 'F', 'xS', 'FS', 'SF', or 'xF' (not part of the loop head).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1`. Given `n` is 3, the loop will run for `j = 1, 2, 3`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 2.
   - The loop will increment `j` by 1, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains 4 (not part of the loop head).
   - `n` remains 3 (part of the loop head).
   - `j` is incremented to 3 (part of the loop head).
   - `nx` remains unchanged (not part of the loop head).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `j` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 3, and `nx` is either 'x', 'S', 'F', 'xS', 'FS', 'SF', or 'xF'**.
