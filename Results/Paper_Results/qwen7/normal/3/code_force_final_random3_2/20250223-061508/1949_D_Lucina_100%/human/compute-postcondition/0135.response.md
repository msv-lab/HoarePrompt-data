Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `a[2]` is yet to be determined, `b[2]` is 0, `sa` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and 3, `sb` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and 3. If `b[3]` is greater than 0 and `a[3]` is 0, then `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged.**
