Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is 'F', `j` must be within the range [1, 5), `n` is 4, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string (`''`), after executing this line, `nx` becomes `'F'`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
