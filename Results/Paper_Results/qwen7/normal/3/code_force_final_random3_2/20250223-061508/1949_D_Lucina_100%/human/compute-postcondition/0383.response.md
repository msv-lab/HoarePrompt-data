Functionality: **The function processes an input consisting of \( n \) lines, each containing \( n \) characters representing the partial transition video plan between scenarios. Each character can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no transition video). The function calculates the cumulative counts of 'F' and 'S' characters across all input strings and then generates a new set of transition video plans based on these counts. If the count of 'F' is greater than or equal to the count of 'S', it fills in '?' with 'F'; otherwise, it fills in '?' with 'S'. The function prints the new transition video plans.**
