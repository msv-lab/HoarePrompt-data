Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `a[i]` is 0, `b[i]` is 0, `sa` is a list containing the numbers from 1 to `n`, `sb` is a list containing the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. The current value of `a[i]` is 0 and the current value of `b[i]` is 0.
