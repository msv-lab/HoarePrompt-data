Postcondition: `total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `a[3]` is 0, `b[3]` is 0, `sa` is [1, 2, 3], `sb` is a list containing the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. If `a[3]` and `b[3]` are both 0, the values of `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged.
