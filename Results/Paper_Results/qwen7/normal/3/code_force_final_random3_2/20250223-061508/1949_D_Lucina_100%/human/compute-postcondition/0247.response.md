Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` and `j` are indices within `xx`, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' followed by the character in `xx[i][j - 1]`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `n` is the same.**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by appending the character from `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and the values of `xx`, `i`, `n` remain unchanged.
