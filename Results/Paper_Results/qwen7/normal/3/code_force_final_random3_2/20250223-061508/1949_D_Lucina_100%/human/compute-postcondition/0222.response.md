Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 0
- `i` is 5
- `nx` is 'FFS'
- `j` is 7
- `n` is 4

The loop processes `j` values from 1 to 4. For each value of `j`, the following happens:
- `nx` is modified by appending 'F' twice and 'S' once to it.

Let's break down the loop:

1. When `j` is 1:
   - `nx` becomes 'FFS'

2. When `j` is 2:
   - `nx` becomes 'FFFFS'

3. When `j` is 3:
   - `nx` becomes 'FFFFFFS'

4. When `j` is 4:
   - `nx` becomes 'FFFFFFFFFFS'

After the loop completes, `nx` will be 'FFFFFFFFFFS'.

Therefore, the `print(nx)` statement will print the string 'FFFFFFFFFFS'.

Output: **FFFFFFFFFFS**
