Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `a[2]` is yet to be determined, `b[2]` is 0, `sa` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and 3, `sb` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and 3.**

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `sb`. Initially, `sb` contains the values [1, 2]. After appending `i`, `sb` becomes [1, 2, 3]. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
