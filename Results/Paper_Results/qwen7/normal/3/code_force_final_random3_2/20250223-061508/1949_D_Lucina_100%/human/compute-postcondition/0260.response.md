Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `a[i]` is 0, `b[i]` is 0, and `sb` has appended the value `i`.**

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `sb`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `n` remains the total number of iterations the loop executed, `a[i]` remains 0, `b[i]` remains 0, and `sb` now contains the value `i` appended to it.
