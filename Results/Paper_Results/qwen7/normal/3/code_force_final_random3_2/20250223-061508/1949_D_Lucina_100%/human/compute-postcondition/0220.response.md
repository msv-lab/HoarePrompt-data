Output State: `total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is 'FFF', `j` is 7, and `n` is 4.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n` (inclusive). Given `n` is 4, the loop will run 4 times. After the first iteration, `j` becomes 2. After the second iteration, `j` becomes 3. After the third iteration, `j` becomes 4. After the fourth and final iteration, `j` becomes 5. Since `j` increments by 1 each iteration and the loop runs 4 times, `j` will be 5 after the last iteration. However, the problem states that `j` is 6 in the state after 3 iterations, which implies that the loop has completed its 4 iterations and `j` has incremented to 7. During these iterations, `nx` is built up based on the conditions provided. If `xx[5][j-1]` is not '?', `nx` appends the character from `xx[5][j-1]`. If it is '?', and certain conditions are met, `nx` appends 'F' or 'S'. Given the pattern described, `nx` ends up as 'FFF' after 4 iterations.
