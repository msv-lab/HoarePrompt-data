Output State: **`i` is less than 4, `n` is 3, `nx` is 'S', `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'**, and either `i` is in `sb[:1]` or `j` is in `sb[:1]`.

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string (`''`), after appending 'S', `nx` becomes `'S'`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and `xx[i][j - 1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition about `i` being in `sb[:1]` or `j` being in `sb[:1]` remains the same as well.
