Output State: `i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 4, and `nx` is either 'FSS' or 'FSF'.

Explanation: The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` (which is 3). After 3 iterations, `j` will be 4. Given the conditions in the loop, `nx` can take on one of two final values based on the conditions met during the iterations. If `xx[i][j - 1]` was not '?' for all three iterations, `nx` would be 'FSFS'. However, since the problem specifies the output states after the first three iterations, we know that `nx` could be 'FSS' if `xx[i][j - 1]` was '?' in the third iteration, or 'FSF' if it was not '?'. Therefore, the final value of `nx` will be either 'FSS' or 'FSF'.
