Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is less than 4.
- `n` is 3.
- `nx` is either 'SFSFSF' or 'FFSFSF', or it could be one of 'SFSFSS', 'FFSFSF', 'SFFS', 'FFFS', 'SFFSS', 'FFFSS', 'SFFF', or 'FFFF'.
- `j` is 3.
- `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(nx)
```

Given that `nx` can take on several values but none of them include the character '?', and since no specific value for `nx` is explicitly provided other than the conditions mentioned, the output will be one of the valid strings for `nx`.

Output: **'SFSFSF' or 'FFSFSF' or 'SFSFSS' or 'FFSFSF' or 'SFFS' or 'FFFS' or 'SFFSS' or 'FFFSS' or 'SFFF' or 'FFFF'**
