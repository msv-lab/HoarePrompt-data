Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: 
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `n` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.
   - `a[2]` is 0.
   - `b[2]` is 0.
   - `sb` has appended the value 2 and now contains `[2, 2]`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Update the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it is the total number of iterations the loop has executed so far.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `a[2]` and `b[2]` remain 0.
   - `sb` remains `[2, 2]`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 3, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `a[2]` is 0, `b[2]` is 0, `sb` has appended the value 2 and now contains [2, 2]**.
