Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `nx` is 'S', `j` is 2, `n` is 4, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'S'. All other variables remain unchanged.
