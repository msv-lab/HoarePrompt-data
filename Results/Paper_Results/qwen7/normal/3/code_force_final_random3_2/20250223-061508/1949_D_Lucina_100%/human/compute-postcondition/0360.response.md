Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `j`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**: From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` is 3
   - `j` is 1
   - `nx` is either 'x', 'S', or 'F' based on certain conditions.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. Since `n` is 3, the loop will run for `j` values from 1 to 4 (inclusive).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `nx`) do not change within the loop head and are not directly affected by the loop itself.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Given that `j` is incremented to 2, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 2, and `nx` is either 'x', 'S', or 'F' based on the same conditions as before.**
