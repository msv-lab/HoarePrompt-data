Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 3
   - `x` is an input string
   - `j` is 3
   - If `x[2]` equals 'F', then `a[3]` is increased by 1.
   - If `x[2]` equals 'S', then `b[3]` is set to 4.
   - If `x[2]` does not equal 'S', no change is made to `b[3]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3.
   - The loop condition is `j in range(1, n + 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (from 3 to 4).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Final States:**
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `n` remains at least 3.
   - `x` remains the same input string.
   - `j` is now 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, `x` is an input string, `j` is 4**
