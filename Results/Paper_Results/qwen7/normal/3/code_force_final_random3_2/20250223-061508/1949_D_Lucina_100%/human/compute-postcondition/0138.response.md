Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `a[i]` is 0 for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `b[i]` is 0 for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `sa` is a list containing the numbers from 1 to `n`, `sb` is a list containing the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`**.
