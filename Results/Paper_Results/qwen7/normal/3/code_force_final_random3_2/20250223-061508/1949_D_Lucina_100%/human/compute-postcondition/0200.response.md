Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is 'S', `j` must be within the range [1, 5), `n` is 4, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'**, `j` is not in `sa[:1]`.

Explanation: The variable `nx` is concatenated with the string 'S', resulting in `nx` becoming 'S'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
