Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 3, and `nx` is either 'xF' or 'xSF' or 'FSF' or 'SFxF' or 'xSxF' or 'xFxF' or 'xF'.**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is concatenated with the string `'F'`. Since `nx` could be one of several strings, after appending `'F'`, `nx` could become one of the following: `'xF'`, `'xSF'`, `'FSF'`, `'SFxF'`, `'xSxF'`, `'xFxF'`, or `'xF'` (if `nx` was already `'F'`). All other variables remain unchanged.
