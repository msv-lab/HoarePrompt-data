Output State: `total` remains 0, `i` is 6, `nx` is 'FFS', `j` is 10, and `n` is 4.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1 - 1`, which means it will run 4 times since `n` is 4. Based on the given output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that:

- After the first iteration (`j = 1`), `nx` became 'F'.
- After the second iteration (`j = 2`), `nx` became 'FF'.
- After the third iteration (`j = 3`), `nx` became 'FFS'.

Since the loop continues until `j = n`, which is 4 in this case, the fourth iteration would set `j` to 4. Given the pattern, `nx` would not change further as it already contains 'FFS' and no new characters are added because the condition `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'` does not specify any further additions beyond the third iteration. Therefore, `nx` remains 'FFS' after all iterations, and the other variables (`total`, `i`, `j`, and `n`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
