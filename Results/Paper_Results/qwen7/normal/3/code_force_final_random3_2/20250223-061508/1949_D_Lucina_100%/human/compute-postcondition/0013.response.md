Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be at least 2; `x` is an input string; `j` is 1; `b[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1, `b[i]` is updated to 1. The other variables (`n`, `x`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
