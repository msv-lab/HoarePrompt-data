Output State: **`i` is less than 4, `n` is 3, `nx` is the string `xx[i][j - 1]`, `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given that `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0. So, `nx` is updated to include the character at position `[i][0]` from the list `xx`. The other variables remain unchanged.
