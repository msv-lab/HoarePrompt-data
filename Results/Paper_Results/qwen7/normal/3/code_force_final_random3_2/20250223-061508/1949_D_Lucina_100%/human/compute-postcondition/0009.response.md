Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is an input string, `j` is 2, and `a[j]` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, the value of `a[1]` (which was 2) is incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
