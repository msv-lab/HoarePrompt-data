Output State: **`nx` is either 'SS' or 'SF' or 'FS' or 'FF', `i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 4**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the character at index `[i][j-1]` from the list `xx`. Given that `i` is 4 and `j` is 4, the index `[i][j-1]` becomes `[4][3]`. However, since the initial state does not provide the exact content of `xx`, `nx` could be any of the following combinations: 'SS', 'SF', 'FS', or 'FF', depending on what `xx[4][3]` is. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
