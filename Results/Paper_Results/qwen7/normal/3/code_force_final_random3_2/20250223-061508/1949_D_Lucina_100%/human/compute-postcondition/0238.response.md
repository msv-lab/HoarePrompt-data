Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `xx` is a 2D list.
   - `i` and `j` are indices within `xx`.
   - `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is increased by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, and 'S' otherwise.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant defined before the loop.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - `i` and `j` will be adjusted according to the loop increment.
   - `nx` will depend on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` in the next iteration.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1, the new state will be:

- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `i` and `n` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` and `j` are indices within `xx`, and `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is increased by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j + 1` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, and 'S' otherwise.**
