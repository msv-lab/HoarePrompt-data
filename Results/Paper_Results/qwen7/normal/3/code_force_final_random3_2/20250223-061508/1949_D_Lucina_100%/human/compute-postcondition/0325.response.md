Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` is 3
   - `j` is 3
   - `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'
   - The postcondition for `nx` is:
     - If `xx[4][2]` is not '?', then `nx` is set to `xx[4][2]`.
     - Otherwise, `nx` is 'S' if `i` is in `sb[:1]` or `j` is in `sb[:1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'F' and `xx[4][2]` remains unchanged as '?'.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and `n` is 3, the loop will execute once more with `j` being 4.
   - Therefore, we need to update the state of `j` to 4.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `i` remains 4.
   - `n` remains 3.
   - `nx` remains either 'S' or 'F' because it does not depend on the loop variable `j`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` is 3
   - `j` is 4
   - `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 4, `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'**
