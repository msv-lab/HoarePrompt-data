Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 2, `nx` is 'xF'**

Explanation: The variable `nx` was either 'x', 'S', or 'F'. After executing `nx += 'F'`, the value of `nx` is updated to concatenate the current value of `nx` with the string `'F'`. If `nx` was 'x', it becomes 'xF'; if `nx` was 'S', it becomes 'SF'; and if `nx` was 'F', it becomes 'FF'. Since the exact initial value of `nx` is not specified beyond being one of 'x', 'S', or 'F', the most general answer is that `nx` is now 'xF' (assuming the initial value was 'x').
