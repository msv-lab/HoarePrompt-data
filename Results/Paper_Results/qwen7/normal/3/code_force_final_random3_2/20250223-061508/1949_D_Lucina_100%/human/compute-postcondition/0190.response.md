Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 5
   - `nx` is either 'FFxF', 'FSxF', 'SFSx', 'SSxF', 'FFSx', 'FSSF', 'SFFx', or 'SSSx'
   - `j` is 4
   - `n` is 4

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. Since `n` is 4, the loop will run 4 times (from `i = 1` to `i = 4`).

4. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5. This means the loop has completed its iterations and `i` is now 5.

5. **Next Iteration of the Loop**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range specified by the loop condition (`1` to `4`). However, since `i` is currently 5, the loop cannot execute again as it has already completed its iterations.

6. **Adjusting the States**: Since the loop cannot execute again due to the current value of `i`, we do not need to adjust the states related to the loop head. The states related to the loop head (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop has already completed its iterations.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is either 'FFxF', 'FSxF', 'SFSx', 'SSxF', 'FFSx', 'FSSF', 'SFFx', or 'SSSx', `j` is 4, `n` is 4**
