Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[i]` increased by 1, `xx` contains one element which is the list `x`, and `x[j - 1]` is 'S'.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is `n + 1`, `b[i]` refers to the element `b[n + 1]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
