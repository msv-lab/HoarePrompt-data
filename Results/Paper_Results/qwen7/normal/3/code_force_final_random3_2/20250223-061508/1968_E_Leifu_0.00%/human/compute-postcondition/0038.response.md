Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 7 is no longer applicable since `n` now holds the value of an integer input, which could be any integer.
