Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` must be greater than 4.
- `j` is explicitly defined as 5.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `j` is explicitly given as 5.
2. The `str()` function converts `j` to a string, resulting in "5".
3. The expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` concatenates the string "5" with a space character and then with another "5", resulting in the string "5 5".

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **5 5**
