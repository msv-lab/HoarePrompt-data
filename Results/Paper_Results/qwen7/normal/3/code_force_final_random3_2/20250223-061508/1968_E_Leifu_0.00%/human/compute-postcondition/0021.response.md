Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
     - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
     - `n` must be greater than 3.
     - `i` must be 0.
     - If `n` equals 3, then `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `j` is equal to `n`.

3. **Analyze the loop increment**:
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration of the loop.

4. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration and the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will now be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `t`. Given that `i` is now 1, `t` must be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `t` must be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

6. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `n` and `j` are not directly affected by the loop itself, but they must still satisfy their initial conditions.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.
   - `j` should be equal to `n` if `n` is not 3, otherwise it remains 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 3, and `i` must be 1**.
