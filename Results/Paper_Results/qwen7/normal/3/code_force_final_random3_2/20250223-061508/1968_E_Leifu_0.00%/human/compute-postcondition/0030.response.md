Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `j` is explicitly defined as 4

The `print` statement is `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)`. Since `j` is 4, the expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` will concatenate the string representation of `j` with a space and then again with the string representation of `j`.

So, `str(j)` is `"4"`, and the expression becomes `"4 " + "4"`, which results in the string `"4 4"`.

Output: **"4 4"**
