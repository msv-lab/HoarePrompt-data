Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, inclusive**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, the value of `t` is now an input integer within this range. Additionally, the initial state also mentioned that for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and this information remains unchanged and valid after the code execution.
