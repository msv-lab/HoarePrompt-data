Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`, and `mid` is equal to `h`.**

Explanation: The code `h = mid` simply assigns the current value of `mid` to `h`. Since `mid` was previously defined as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` now holds the same value as `mid`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, and `left - f`, `right - f`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
