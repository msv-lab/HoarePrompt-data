Output State: **`i` is 5, `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`, `max_diff` is as before, `next_max_diff` is `max_diff`, `index` is as before, `n` must be greater than 4**

The code assigns the current value of `max_diff` to `next_max_diff`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `i`, `diff`, `max_diff`, `index`, and `n` remain unchanged.
