Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_diff`: Value after comparison (either updated or remains `-inf`)
   - `next_max_diff`: Updated to `A[1] - A[0]` if `diff` is not greater than `max_diff`, otherwise updated to `diff`
   - `index`: Set to 3 if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, otherwise remains `None`
   - `i`: Set to 3
   - `diff`: Remains `A[1] - A[0]`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The value of `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

6. **Final State**:
   - The other variables (`max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, and `diff`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`max_diff` is as before, `next_max_diff` is as before, `index` is as before, `i` is 4, `diff` is as before, `n` must be greater than 4**
