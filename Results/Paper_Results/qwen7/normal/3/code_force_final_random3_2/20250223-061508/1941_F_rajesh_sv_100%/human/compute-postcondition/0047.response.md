Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Variables in the Loop Head
The loop head is `while l < h:`. The variables involved here are `l` and `h`.

### Step 2: Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute
The loop will execute as long as `l < h`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, the condition `l < h` must be true.

### Step 3: Analyze the Current States of `l` and `h`
- `h` is defined as `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.
- `l` is defined as the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`.

### Step 4: Ensure the Loop Condition is Satisfied
For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be less than `h`. We need to ensure that this condition holds true.

Given the definitions:
- `h` is derived from `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, which means `h` is the position just before the first element in `D` that is greater than or equal to `right - f`.
- `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`.

To satisfy `l < h`, we need to ensure that there exists at least one element in `D` such that:
- `left - F[0] < D[l]`
- `D[h] <= right - f`

If `l` and `h` are correctly set up, then `l < h` should naturally hold true because `l` is the first index where `D[l] > left - F[0]` and `h` is the position just before the first element that is greater than or equal to `right - f`.

However, to ensure the loop can start, we need to make sure that `l` is not equal to `h`. If `l` were equal to `h`, the loop would never execute.

### Conclusion
The current states of `l` and `h` should already satisfy the condition for the loop to execute at least once, given their definitions. Therefore, no additional adjustments are necessary.

### Final Answer
State: **`h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`**
