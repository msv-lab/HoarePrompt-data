Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of (`D[l] + f - left`, `right - D[l] - f`), and `l` is equal to `h`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of two expressions: `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. Since `l` is equal to `h` in the initial state, the output state reflects this condition and the update to `ans`.
