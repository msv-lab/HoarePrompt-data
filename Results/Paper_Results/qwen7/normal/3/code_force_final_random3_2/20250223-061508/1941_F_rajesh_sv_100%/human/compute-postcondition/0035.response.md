Output State: **`i` is 6, `diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`, `max_diff` is `diff`, `index` is 6**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 6) to the variable `index`. The values of `i`, `diff`, and `max_diff` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 6, `diff` is still `A[6] - A[5]`, `max_diff` is still `diff`, and `index` is now 6.
