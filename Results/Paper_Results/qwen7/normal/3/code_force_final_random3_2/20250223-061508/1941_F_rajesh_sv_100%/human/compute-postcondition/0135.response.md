Output State: `f` is the next value in the list `F`; `l` is the smallest index in list `D` such that for all indices `i` in the range `[l, h]`, the sum `D[i] + f` satisfies the condition `D[i] + f >= left` and `D[i+1] + f > right`. `h` is the largest index in list `D` such that for all indices `i` in the range `[l, h]`, the sum `D[i] + f` satisfies the condition `D[i] + f <= right` and `D[i+1] + f > left`. `mid` is the integer part of `(l + h) / 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `l` and `h` have been narrowed down to the range where the sums `D[i] + f` for `i` in `[l, h]` are closest to the values of `left` and `right` without crossing them.
