Output State: **`i` is 5, `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`, `max_diff` is as before, `next_max_diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`, `index` is as before, `n` must be greater than 4**

Explanation: The line `next_max_diff = diff` assigns the current value of `diff` (which is `A[5] - A[4]`) to `next_max_diff`. All other variables remain unchanged.
