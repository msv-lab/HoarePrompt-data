Output State: **`mid_sum` remains `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` remains `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `l` is `mid + 1`, while `l < h` still holds true.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, and the condition `l < h`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
