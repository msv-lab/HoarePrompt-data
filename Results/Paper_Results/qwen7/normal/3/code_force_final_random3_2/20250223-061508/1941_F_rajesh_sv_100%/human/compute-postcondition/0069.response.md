Output State: The loop continues to narrow down the range defined by `l` and `h` until `l` is no longer less than `h`. At the end of all iterations, `l` will be equal to `h`, and both will point to the index in `D` where the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is no longer satisfied. The value of `mid` will also be equal to `l` and `h`, representing the final midpoint of the last iteration's search range. The variables `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will hold the values of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively, corresponding to the last checked indices.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `l` and `h` will converge to the same index, indicating the boundary where the loop condition no longer holds. The `mid` variable will also reflect this index, and `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will contain the sum values at these indices plus `f`.
