Output State: **`mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is `mid + 1`, and `h` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. All other variables (`mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, and `h`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `l < h` still holds true as no changes were made to `h`.
