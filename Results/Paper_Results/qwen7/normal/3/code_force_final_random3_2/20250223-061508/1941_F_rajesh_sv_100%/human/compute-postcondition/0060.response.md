Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` remains unchanged, `h` is equal to `mid`, and `f` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `h = mid` updates the value of `h` to be equal to the current value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
