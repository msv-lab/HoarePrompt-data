Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`.**

Explanation: The variable `mid` is calculated as the midpoint between `l` and `h`. Since `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, and `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`, the value of `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`. The values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged.
