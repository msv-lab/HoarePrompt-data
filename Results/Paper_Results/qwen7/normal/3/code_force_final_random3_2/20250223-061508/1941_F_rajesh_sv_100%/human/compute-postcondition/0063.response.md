Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` remains unchanged, `h` must be greater than `l`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mid` to `l + (h - l) // 2`. The other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, and `h`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
