Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` remains unchanged, `h` is now `mid`.**

Explanation: The variable `h` is assigned the value of `mid`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, `l`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
