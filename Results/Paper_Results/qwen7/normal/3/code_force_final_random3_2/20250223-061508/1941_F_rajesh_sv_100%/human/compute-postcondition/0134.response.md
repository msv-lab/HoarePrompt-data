Output State: `f` is the next value in the list `F`; `l` is the smallest index in list `D` such that `D[l] + f >= left` and `l` is also the largest index less than `h`; `h` is the largest index in list `D` such that `D[h-1] + f < right`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `l` will point to the smallest index in list `D` where the condition `D[l] + f >= left` is satisfied, and this index is also the largest index less than `h`. The variable `h` will be the index just before the first element in list `D` that is no longer valid for the condition `D[h-1] + f < right`. This final state ensures that `l` and `h` define the range within which the sum of `f` and any element in list `D` falls between `left` and `right`.
