Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, and `l` is updated to `mid + 1`**.

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to `mid + 1`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, `h`, and `l`) retain their previous values or expressions. The condition `(mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum)` remains true, but it is not directly affected by the assignment to `l`.
