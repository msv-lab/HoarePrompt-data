Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is still satisfied, so the value of `h` remains the same.
