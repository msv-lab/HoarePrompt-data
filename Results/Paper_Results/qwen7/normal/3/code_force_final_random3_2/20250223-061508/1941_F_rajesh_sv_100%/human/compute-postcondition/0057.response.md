Output State: **`mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` remains unchanged, and `h` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `mid` to the value of `l + (h - l) // 2`. This calculation does not affect the values of `l` and `h`. The initial conditions that `mid` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `l + (h - l) // 2` are preserved, and the loop condition that `h` must be greater than `l + 1` remains valid. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `mid`, which is now set to `l + (h - l) // 2`.
