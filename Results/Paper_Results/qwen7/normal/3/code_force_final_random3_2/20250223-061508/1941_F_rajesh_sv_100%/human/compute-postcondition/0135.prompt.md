Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `f` is the next value in the list `F`; `l` is the index of the first element in list `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`; `h` is the index obtained by subtracting 1 from the index where `right - f` would be inserted in list `D` using binary search (bisect_left).
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `f` is the next value in the list `F`, `l` is `mid + 1` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true, otherwise `l` remains the index of the first element in list `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`. `h` is adjusted to `mid` if the condition is false, otherwise `h` remains the same. `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. The overall postcondition ensures that either `l` is updated to `mid + 1` with the condition being met, or `h` is adjusted to `mid` with the condition not being met.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid` and `l < h` must still hold true.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `mid_sum` remains `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` remains `D[mid + 1] + f`, and either `l` is updated to `mid + 1` with `l < h` still holding true, or `h` is updated to `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
