The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is a placeholder variable used when the variable name is not needed) and `testcases`. Since `_` is a placeholder, it does not affect the loop's continuation. The loop will continue as long as `testcases` is a positive integer.

At the end of the previous iteration, `testcases` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must still be a positive integer. However, since `testcases` is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs, after one more iteration, `testcases` will be a non-positive integer (either 0 or negative).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must be decremented by 1 from its current positive value.

State: **`testcases` is a positive integer minus 1**
