Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `mid_sum` the value of `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` the value of `D[mid + 1] + f`. The values of `mid`, `h`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
