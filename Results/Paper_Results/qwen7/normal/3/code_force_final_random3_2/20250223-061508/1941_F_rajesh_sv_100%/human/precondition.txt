t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The list a contains n strictly increasing integers, and the lists d and f contain m and k positive integers respectively, with values within specified ranges. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sums of m and k across all test cases do not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
