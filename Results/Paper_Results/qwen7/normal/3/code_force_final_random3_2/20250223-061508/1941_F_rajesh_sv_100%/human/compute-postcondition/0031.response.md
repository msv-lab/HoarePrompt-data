Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
   ```
   The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 5
   - `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`
   - `max_diff` remains unchanged
   - `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff > max_diff` or `A[5] - A[4]` if `diff <= max_diff`
   - `index` is 5
   - `n` must be greater than 4

3. **Determine the Next Values for `i` and `n`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 5.
   - Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 6`.
   - Since the loop condition is `range(1, n)`, `n` must remain the same for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be 6.
   - `n` must still be greater than 4 (it doesn't change in this context).

5. **Other States Remain Unchanged:**
   - `diff` is based on `A[5] - A[4]` and won't change unless the array `A` changes.
   - `max_diff` remains unchanged.
   - `next_max_diff` is based on the comparison with `max_diff` and won't change unless `diff` changes.
   - `index` is based on `i` and will be 6 in the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be greater than 4**
