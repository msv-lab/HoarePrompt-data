Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `mid`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`**

Explanation: The line `h = mid` assigns the current value of `mid` to `h`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, `h`, `l`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
