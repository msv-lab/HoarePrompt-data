Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, and `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, arr = test_cases[i]
    arr.sort()
    median_index = n // 2
    current_median = arr[median_index]
    heap = arr[median_index:]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    operations = 0
    while heap[0] <= current_median:
        smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
        heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
        operations += 1
    results.append(operations)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element being `smallest + 3`, `smallest` is decreased by 1, and `heap` now contains `smallest + 3`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3, `smallest` is the original smallest element plus 2, `heap` has been updated to include `smallest + 1` three times, `results` is [3]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3; `current_median` remains unchanged; `smallest` holds the original smallest element; `operations` is 3; `results` is a list containing 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
