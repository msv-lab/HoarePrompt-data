Output State: **`operations` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, excluding the smallest element, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`, and `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1` where `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap` and `heap[0] <= current_median`**.

Explanation: The code pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to `smallest`. The value of `heap[0]` is updated to `smallest + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
