Output State: **`operations` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr`.**

The code initializes the variable `operations` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, and `heap` remain unchanged from their initial states.
