Output State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element being `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the previous smallest element popped from the heap, `smallest` is decreased by 1, and `heap` now contains `smallest + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `operations` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
