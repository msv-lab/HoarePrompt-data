Output State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3, `smallest` is the original smallest element plus 2, `heap` has been updated to include `smallest + 1` three times, `results` is [3, `n`, `arr[0]`].**

Explanation: The code updates `n` and `arr` by assigning `test_cases[i]` to them. Since `i` is 2, `n` will be the first element of `test_cases[2]`, and `arr` will be the second element of `test_cases[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
