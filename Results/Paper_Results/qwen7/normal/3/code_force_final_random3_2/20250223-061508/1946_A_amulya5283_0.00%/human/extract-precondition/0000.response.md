Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (the length of the array a) followed by n integers representing the array a. The length of each array a satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^5 and each element of the array a satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
