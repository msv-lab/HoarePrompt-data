Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. After sorting, `arr` contains the elements of its original list in sorted order.
