Output State: **`operations` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, excluding the smallest element, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`, `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1`, and `heap` now contains `smallest + 1` added to it.**

Explanation: The line `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Since `operations` was initially 1, after executing this line, its new value is 2. All other variables remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
