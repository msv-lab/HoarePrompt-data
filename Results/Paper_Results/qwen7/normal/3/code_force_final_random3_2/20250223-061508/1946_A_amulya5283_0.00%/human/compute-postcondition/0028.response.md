The code `current_median = arr[median_index]` simply assigns the value of `arr[median_index]` to `current_median`. Since `median_index` is `n // 2`, and `arr` is a sorted list, `current_median` is already set to `arr[n // 2]`. This assignment does not change the value of `current_median`, so it remains the same.

The other variables remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element being `smallest + 2`, `smallest` is decreased by 1.**
