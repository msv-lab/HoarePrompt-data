Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases) and test_cases (a list of tuples). Each tuple contains an integer n (the length of the array a) followed by n integers representing the array a. After processing all test cases, the function returns a list of 3 for each test case.**
