Output State: **`heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`; `smallest` is the value that was at `heap[0]` before popping.**

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. The precondition that `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median` remains valid after the operation, but now `heap[0]` no longer holds the value it previously did because the smallest element (now stored in `smallest`) has been removed.
