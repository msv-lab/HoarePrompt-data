Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 1`, `y` is 4**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Initially, `cnt` is -1, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 1`, and `y` is 4.
2. The code updates `cnt` with the expression `cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
3. First, calculate `math.ceil(x / y)`. Since `x` is `n - 1` and `y` is 4, `x / y` is `(n - 1) / 4`. If `n` is 5, then `x` is 4, and `math.ceil(4 / 4)` is `1`.
4. Next, calculate `x % y == 0`. Since `x` is 4 and `y` is 4, `4 % 4` is `0`, so `x % y == 0` is `True`, which evaluates to `1`.
5. Substitute these values into the expression: `cnt + 1 + 1`.
6. Since `cnt` was initially -1, the new value of `cnt` is `-1 + 1 + 1`, which is `1`.
7. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated values are: `cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - 1`, and `y` is 4.
