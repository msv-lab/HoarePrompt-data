### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the function `func_2` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem. However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the provided test cases, it appears that the function `func_2` actually does correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's re-evaluate the function `func_2`:

1. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - The expression `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is used to increment the count `cnt`.

2. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The variable \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) is derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The term \(i * i\) represents \(b \cdot b\), and the expression `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` ensures that \(x\) is a multiple of \(y\).

3. **Test Case Verification:**
   - The provided test cases show that the function `func_2` produces the correct results for various inputs.

Given the detailed analysis and the correctness of the test cases, the function `func_2` indeed correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was incorrect because the function `func_2` is actually correct and works as intended.

**Final: True**
