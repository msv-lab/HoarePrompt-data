### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Function `func_1`:
This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This part is correct and will be used in the next function.

#### Function `func_2`:
The function `func_2` is supposed to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the current implementation does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Let's break down the current implementation and see why it is incorrect.

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. **Calculation of \(x\)**: \(x = n - (i * i - i)\). This expression does not seem to have any direct relation to the problem constraints.
3. **Calculation of \(y\)**: \(y = i * i\). This is simply \(i^2\).
4. **Update of `cnt`**:
   - `math.ceil(x / y)` is used to round up the division of \(x\) by \(y\).
   - `(x % y == 0)` checks if \(x\) is divisible by \(y\).
   - These operations do not directly relate to the problem constraints.

Given the problem constraints, the correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation does not do this.

#### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation would involve:
1. Iterating over all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. For each pair, calculating \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The current implementation in `func_2` does not follow this logic and thus does not correctly solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
