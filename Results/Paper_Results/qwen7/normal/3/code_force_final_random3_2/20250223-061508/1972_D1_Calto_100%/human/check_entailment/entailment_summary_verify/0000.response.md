Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Function Analysis

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - This is a standard and correct implementation of the GCD calculation.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function summary states that `func_2` returns a value `cnt` that is always 10, regardless of the input values \(n\) and \(m\).
   - This is clearly incorrect because the number of valid pairs depends on the values of \(n\) and \(m\), and should not be a constant value like 10.

### Correct Implementation

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

### Evaluation

Given the analysis above, the original program does not correctly solve the problem. The `func_2` function returns a constant value of 10, which is incorrect. The provided solution also does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
