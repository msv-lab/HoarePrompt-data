### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description.

#### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\),
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\),
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Given Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - However, it is not used in the main logic of the program.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) using a different approach.
   - The function iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then updates the count `cnt` based on the condition involving `math.ceil(x / y)` and `(x % y == 0)`.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code incorrectly states that `cnt` should be 10 for \(n = 3\) and \(m = 3\), which is not true.
- The logic inside `func_2` does not match the problem requirements. Specifically, the expressions for `x` and `y` do not align with the conditions \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This corrected version correctly counts the number of valid pairs by iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the given condition.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not match the problem requirements.

**Final: False**
