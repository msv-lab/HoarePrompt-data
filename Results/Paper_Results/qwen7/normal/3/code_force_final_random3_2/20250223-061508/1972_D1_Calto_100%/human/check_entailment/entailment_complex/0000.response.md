Reasoning:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. The explanation and the code match, and the function works as intended.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem statement, the goal is to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the provided implementation of `func_2` does not follow this logic. Instead, it uses a formula involving `i * i` and `n - (i * i - i)` which does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the calculation of `x` and `y` and the increment of `cnt` do not reflect the necessary conditions of the problem.

Given the discrepancy between the problem requirements and the implementation of `func_2`, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
