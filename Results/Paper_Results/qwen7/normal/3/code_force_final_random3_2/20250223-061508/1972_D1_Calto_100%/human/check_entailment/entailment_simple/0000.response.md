Reasoning:
- The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
- The Euclidean algorithm implemented in `func_1` is correct and is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, but it is not utilized in `func_2` in a way that addresses the problem statement.
- In `func_2`, the logic to count the valid pairs is incorrect. The current implementation does not follow the problem's constraints and conditions properly. It seems to be attempting to count something related to squares and differences but does not align with the requirement that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given these observations, the provided function `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
