Postcondition: `ans` is -1, `i` is 2, `lsum` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - 2`. If the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` remains -1. Otherwise, `ans` remains -1 as well since there is no else part.
