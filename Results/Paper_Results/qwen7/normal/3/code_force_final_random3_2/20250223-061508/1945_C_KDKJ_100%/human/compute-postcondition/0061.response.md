Output State: **`ans` is 3, `i` is 3, `lsum` is 3, `left` is `S[3][0]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[3][1]`, `rsum` is n - 3**.

Explanation: The line `ans = i` assigns the value of `i`, which is 3, to `ans`. All other variables (`lsum`, `left`, `right`, and `rsum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
