Output State: **`ans` is -1, `i` is 3, `lsum` is 3, `left` is `S[3][0]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - 2`**

Explanation: The code `lsum = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `lsum`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `lsum` is updated to 3, while `ans`, `i`, `left`, `right`, and `rsum` retain their original values.
