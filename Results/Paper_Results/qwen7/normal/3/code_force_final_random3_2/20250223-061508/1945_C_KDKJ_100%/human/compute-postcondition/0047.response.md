Output State: **`ans` is -1, `i` is 2, `lsum` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]` to the variable `right`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression `S[i][1]` becomes `S[2][1]`. The value of `S[-1][1]` and `S[2][1]` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain as part of the expression for `right`. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `lsum`, and `left`) are not affected by this line of code.
