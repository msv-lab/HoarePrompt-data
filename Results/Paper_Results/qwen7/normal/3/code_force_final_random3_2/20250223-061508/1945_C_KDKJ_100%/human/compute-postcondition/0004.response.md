Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved in the loop condition is `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `func_1()` has been called again.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `func_1()` has been called again, it implies that the input provided to `int(input())` should be a positive integer for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - The state of `func_1()` being called again does not directly affect the loop condition.
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())`, which must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
