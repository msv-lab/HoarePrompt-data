Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly processes the input string `a` and computes the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each house position.
   - It then iterates through each possible position `i` to check if placing the road there satisfies the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - The function correctly updates the variable `ans` to store the optimal position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2` while satisfying the conditions.
   - The function handles all edge cases, including when no valid position is found, by setting `ans` to -1 if no valid position is found.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It ensures that `func_1` is called the correct number of times based on the input.
   - There are no side effects or modifications to global state that could affect the correctness of the solution.

Given the problem description and the provided comments, both functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions handle all cases as specified, and the logic is sound.
