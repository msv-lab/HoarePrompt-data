Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` expression. This means the loop variable `_` (which is typically an underscore indicating it's not used) and the input value from `int(input())` are the relevant variables.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the input value is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `func_1()` has been called, but no specific values or states related to the loop itself have been mentioned.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the input value must be greater than 0. Since the input value is the only variable that affects the loop condition, we need to ensure that the input value is greater than 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the input value is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`func_1()` has been called, input value must be greater than 0**
