Output State: **The function `func_1()` is called again.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `func_1()` can be called again, and the only condition for the loop to continue is that `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since the function call itself does not change any variable values but rather controls the loop continuation, the output state remains as the function being called again, ensuring the loop continues with the next input check.
