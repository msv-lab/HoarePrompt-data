Output State: The final state of `S` will be a list containing sublists where each sublist represents the count of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `a`. Specifically, the last sublist in `S` will have two elements: the total count of '0's in `a` and the total count of '1's in `a`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all iterations, `S` will contain a single sublist where the first element is the total number of '0's in the input string `a`, and the second element is the total number of '1's in the input string `a`.
