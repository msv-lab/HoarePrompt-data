Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `lsum` is 0, `rsum` is `n - 0`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `ans`. All other variables (`lsum` and `rsum`) remain unchanged. The condition about the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` being less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans` is also preserved.
