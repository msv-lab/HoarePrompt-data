Output State: **`S` is a list containing a sublist `[last_element_of_S + 1, last_element_of_S]` if `s` is '0', or `[last_element_of_S, last_element_of_S + 1]` otherwise; `x` is either `last_element_of_S + 2` or `last_element_of_S + 1`; `y` is either `last_element_of_S` or `last_element_of_S + 1`; `S` is now updated with the new sublist `[x, y]`.**

This means that the list `S` has been appended with a new sublist `[x, y]`, where `x` and `y` are defined based on the initial conditions. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
