Output State: The final state of `S` will be a list containing sublists where the last element of each sublist is equal to the total number of '1's in the string `a`, and the second last element is equal to the total number of '0's in the string `a`.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop, `S` will contain a single sublist where the first element (`x`) is the count of '1's in the string `a`, and the second element (`y`) is the count of '0's in the string `a`.
