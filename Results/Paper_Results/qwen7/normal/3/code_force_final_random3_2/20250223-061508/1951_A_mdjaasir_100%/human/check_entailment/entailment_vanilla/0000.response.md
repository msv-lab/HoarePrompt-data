### Reasoning:

The provided Python program `func()` does not relate to the problem described in the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function. The `func()` function reads an integer `t`, followed by `t` test cases, and checks certain conditions based on the binary string input. It does not interact with any files or directories, nor does it generate any files as specified in the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.

Given that the question asks to determine the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, the `func()` function is irrelevant to this task. Therefore, we should focus solely on the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.

### Analysis of `generate_files_for_html_in_range` Function:

1. **Directory Scanning**: The function correctly scans the current directory for subdirectories.
2. **Filtering Subdirectories**: It filters these subdirectories to only include those that are numeric and fall within the specified range (`start` to `end`).
3. **File Listing**: For each qualifying subdirectory, it lists all `.html` files.
4. **File Creation**: It creates two new files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in the subdirectory.
5. **Output**: It prints the number of `.html` files found in each subdirectory and the paths of the newly created files.

The logic and implementation in the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function appear to be correct based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:

Since the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function performs the tasks as described without any apparent errors, the program is correct.

### Response:

Correctness: **True**
