Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `t`**:
   - `i` is the loop variable that starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `t` is the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `start` is an integer.
   - `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
   - `t` is an input integer.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < t`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < t`. Therefore, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute even once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `t`. Specifically, `i` should be set to 0 (the initial value), and `t` should be set to at least 1 to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be at least 1**
