Postcondition: `i` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string from the user, `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`, and `count` is not equal to 0. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, then `count` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `count` is either exactly 2 with specific conditions (next character after the first '1' is not '1' or the character following the first '1' is '1'), or `count` is greater than 2 or even.
