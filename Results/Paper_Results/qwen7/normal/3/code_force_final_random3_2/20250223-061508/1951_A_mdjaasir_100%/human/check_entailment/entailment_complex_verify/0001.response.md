### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is the one under scrutiny and provides a detailed analysis of its functionality. However, there is a critical oversight in the original assessment regarding the correctness of the `func()` function. Since the problem description explicitly mentions evaluating the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, the `func()` function should not be considered in the assessment. 

Let's re-evaluate the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function using the provided annotations:

1. **Directory Scanning**: The function correctly uses `os.getcwd()` to get the current working directory and then scans for subdirectories using `os.scandir()`. This part is correct.
2. **Filtering Subdirectories**: The function correctly filters subdirectories to ensure they are numeric and fall within the specified range (`start` to `end`). This part is also correct.
3. **File Listing**: For each qualifying subdirectory, the function correctly lists all `.html` files using `os.listdir()`. This part is correct.
4. **File Creation**: The function correctly creates two new files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in the subdirectory using `open().close()`. This part is correct.
5. **Output**: The function correctly prints the number of `.html` files found in each subdirectory and the paths of the newly created files. This part is correct.

Based on the annotations and the problem description, the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function appears to be implemented correctly according to the requirements.

### Conclusion:

Since the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function performs the tasks as described without any apparent errors, the program is correct.

### Response:

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
