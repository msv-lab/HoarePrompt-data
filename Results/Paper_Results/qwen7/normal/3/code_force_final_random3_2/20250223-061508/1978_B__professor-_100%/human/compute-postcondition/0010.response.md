Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `b` is greater than `a`.
   - The difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   The expression inside the `print` function is:
   \[
   \text{int}((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)
   \]

3. **Break Down the Expression**:
   - `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `b - a` natural numbers.
   - This is because the formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\), and here `k = b - a`.
   - `a * n` multiplies the integer `a` by the integer `n`.

4. **Combining the Parts**:
   - The entire expression adds the sum of the first `b - a` natural numbers to the product of `a` and `n`.
   - Since `b - a` is an integer, the result of \((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2\) is also an integer.
   - Adding `a * n` to this integer results in another integer.
   - The `int()` function ensures that the result is an integer.

5. **Final Value**:
   - The exact value depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `n`, but the expression itself is well-defined and will always produce an integer.

Given the initial conditions and the expression, the output will be the integer value of the expression.

Output: **int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)**
