### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal \( k \).
   - If \( b \leq a \), Bob should sell all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - If \( b - a < n \), Bob should sell the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price.
   - If \( b - a \geq n \), Bob should sell the first \( n \) buns at the modified prices.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly handles the first condition where \( b \leq a \) by printing \( n \times a \).
   - For the case where \( b - a < n \), the code calculates the sum of the first \( b - a + 1 \) terms of an arithmetic sequence and adds the usual price for the remaining buns. This is done using the formula for the sum of the first \( m \) natural numbers: \( \frac{m(m+1)}{2} \).
   - For the case where \( b - a \geq n \), the code uses the same arithmetic sequence sum formula to calculate the profit from the first \( n \) buns and adds the usual price for the remaining buns.

3. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:
     - **Example 1:** \( n = 4 \), \( a = 4 \), \( b = 5 \)
       - \( b > a \) and \( b - a = 1 < n \)
       - The first \( b - a + 1 = 2 \) buns are sold at prices 5 and 4.
       - Remaining buns: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) buns at price 4 each.
       - Total profit: \( 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 \)
       - The code correctly prints 17.
     - **Example 2:** \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
       - \( b > a \) and \( b - a = 4 \geq n \)
       - The first \( n = 5 \) buns are sold at prices 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5.
       - Total profit: \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \)
       - The code correctly prints 35.
     - **Example 3:** \( n = 10 \), \( a = 10 \), \( b = 5 \)
       - \( b \leq a \)
       - The code prints \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \)
       - The code correctly prints 100.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in the code matches the problem statement for all given conditions.
   - The formulas used are correct for calculating the sum of the modified prices and the usual prices.
   - The code handles all edge cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given conditions.
