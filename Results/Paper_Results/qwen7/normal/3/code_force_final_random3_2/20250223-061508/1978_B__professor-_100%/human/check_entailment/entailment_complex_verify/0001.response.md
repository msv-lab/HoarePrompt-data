### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal \( k \).
   - If \( b \leq a \), Bob should sell all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - If \( b - a < n \), Bob should sell the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price.
   - If \( b - a \geq n \), Bob should sell the first \( n \) buns at the modified prices.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly handles the first condition where \( b \leq a \) by printing \( n \times a \).
   - For the case where \( b - a < n \), the code calculates the sum of the first \( b - a + 1 \) terms of an arithmetic sequence and adds the usual price for the remaining buns. This is done using the formula for the sum of the first \( m \) natural numbers: \( \frac{m(m+1)}{2} \).
   - For the case where \( b - a \geq n \), the code uses the same arithmetic sequence sum formula to calculate the profit from the first \( n \) buns and adds the usual price for the remaining buns.

3. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the logic step-by-step:
     - When \( b \leq a \), the profit is simply \( n \times a \). This is correct.
     - When \( b - a < n \), the profit is calculated as:
       \[
       \text{Profit} = \sum_{i=1}^{b-a+1} (b-i+1) + (n - (b-a+1)) \times a
       \]
       Simplifying the sum:
       \[
       \sum_{i=1}^{b-a+1} (b-i+1) = \frac{(b-a+1)(b-a+2)}{2}
       \]
       So the total profit is:
       \[
       \frac{(b-a+1)(b-a+2)}{2} + (n - (b-a+1)) \times a
       \]
       This matches the formula used in the code.
     - When \( b - a \geq n \), the profit is calculated as:
       \[
       \text{Profit} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (b-i+1) + (b-a-n) \times a
       \]
       Simplifying the sum:
       \[
       \sum_{i=1}^{n} (b-i+1) = \frac{n(b+1)}{2}
       \]
       So the total profit is:
       \[
       \frac{n(b+1)}{2} + (b-a-n) \times a
       \]
       This also matches the formula used in the code.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in the code matches the problem statement for all given conditions.
   - The formulas used are correct for calculating the sum of the modified prices and the usual prices.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given conditions.
