Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is set to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are reset to the values of the last test case that was processed.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be set to 0, as it represents the number of remaining test cases, which would be zero after processing all of them. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the values of the last test case that was processed during the loop iterations.
