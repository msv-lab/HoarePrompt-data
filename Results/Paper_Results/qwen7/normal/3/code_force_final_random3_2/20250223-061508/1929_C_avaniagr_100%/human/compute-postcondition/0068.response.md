Postcondition: `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `k` is an integer from the split string, `x` is an integer from the split string, `a` is an integer from the split string, and `z` is an integer. If `x == k - 1`, no changes are made to the list, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `z`. If `x != k - 1`, `z` will be updated multiple times according to the rule `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` starting from its initial value, and if `a` is less than `z` after all iterations, `a` will be updated to `z`.
