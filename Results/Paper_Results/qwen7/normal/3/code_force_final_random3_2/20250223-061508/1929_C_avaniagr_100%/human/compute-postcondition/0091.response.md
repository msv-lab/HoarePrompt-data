Postcondition: **The list `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, the third element is a string with at least two integers separated by spaces indicating that the loop ran `x - k + 3` times, `i` is `x - k + 2`, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` three times within each iteration of the loop, and the condition `a >= z` is true.**
