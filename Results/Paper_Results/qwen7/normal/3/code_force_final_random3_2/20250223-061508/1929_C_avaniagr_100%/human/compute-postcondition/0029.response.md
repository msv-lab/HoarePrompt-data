Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `x - k + 3`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `x - k + 3`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - The value of `z` was updated by the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - The loop has just completed an iteration, meaning `i` was incremented from its previous value.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - Let's assume the previous value of `i` was `i_prev`.
   - After the loop, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

5. **Determine the new condition for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `x - k + 3`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` should be `i_prev + 1` and it must be less than `x - k + 3`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and the expression `x - k + 3`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `x - k + 3` remains unchanged**.

Since the exact previous value of `i` (`i_prev`) is not provided, let's denote it as `i_prev`. The final answer would be:

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `x - k + 3` remains unchanged**.
