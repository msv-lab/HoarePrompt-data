Output State: **`[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `k` is the first integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, `a` is the third integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, `s` is the third element of `[*open(0)]`, and `z` is `k - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `z = k - 2` assigns the value of `k - 2` to the variable `z`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
