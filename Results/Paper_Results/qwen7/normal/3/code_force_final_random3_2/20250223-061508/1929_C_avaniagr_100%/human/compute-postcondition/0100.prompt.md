Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = k - 2
        for i in range(x - k + 3):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers assigned the values from splitting the string `s`. If `x < k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then `a` remains greater than or equal to `x + 1`; otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `x`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `a` is less than `x + 2`. Additionally, if `x` is equal to `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 2`. Furthermore, the value of `z` will be the initial value of `z` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each of the `x - k + 3` iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `k` is an integer from the split string, `x` is an integer from the split string, `a` is an integer from the split string. If `a < x + 1`, then `a` is updated to `z`, where `z` is an integer that has been updated multiple times according to the rule `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` starting from its initial value. If `a >= x + 1`, then `a` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `k` is the first integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, `a` is the third integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, and `s` is the third element of `[*open(0)]`. If `x < k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition remains unchanged. If `x < k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, the third element of `[*open(0)]` becomes a string indicating that the loop ran `x - k + 3` times, `i` has the value `x - k + 2`, and `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` three times. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, no changes are made to the list. Otherwise, the third element of `[*open(0)]` becomes a string indicating that the loop ran `x - k + 3` times, `i` has the value `x - k + 2`, and `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` three times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
