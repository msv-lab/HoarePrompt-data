Postcondition: **The list `[*open(0)]` remains a list with at least 2 elements, the third element is a string with at least two integers separated by spaces indicating that the loop ran `x - k + 3` times, `i` has the value `x - k + 2`, and `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` three times. The condition `a >= z` or `a < z` holds true.**
