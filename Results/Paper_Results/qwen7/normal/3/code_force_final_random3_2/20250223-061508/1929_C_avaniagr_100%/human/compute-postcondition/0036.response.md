Based on the initial state provided:

- \( z \) will be updated in a loop where it starts with an initial value and then increases by \( z // (k - 1) + 1 \) for each of the \( x - k + 3 \) iterations.
- \( a \) is greater than or equal to \( z \).

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Given this information, the output of the `print` statement does not depend on the values of \( z \), \( a \), \( x \), or \( k \). It only prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
