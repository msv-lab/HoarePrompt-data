Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of two positive integers n and m where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. It returns either an error message indicating that t is out of the allowed range or a pair of integers n and m.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any direct parameters but is designed to handle a test case which includes three values: `t`, `n`, and `m`. The function checks if `t` is within the range 1 to 100. If `t` is out of this range, it returns an error message. Otherwise, it returns the values of `n` and `m`.
