Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of adding or removing one cube.
- The provided solution reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and checks if `(n - m)` is even and non-negative.
- If `(n - m)` is even and non-negative, it means that the difference between the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Otherwise, it is not possible.
- The logic in the `func_1` function correctly implements this check. It calculates the difference `(n - m)` and checks if it is even and non-negative, printing 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.
- The function does not return any value but directly prints the result, which matches the problem requirements.

Based on the above reasoning, the provided program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
