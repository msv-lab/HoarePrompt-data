Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than `m`. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove exactly one cube per move. Therefore, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even and non-negative for it to be possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, the current implementation only checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, which is not sufficient. 

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`. In this case, `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is true, but it is impossible to end up with 4 cubes after 2 moves because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move. Thus, the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" for this case.

To fix this, the condition should also check if `n >= m`. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
