### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made into an array of identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to check if all elements are the same.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed to make it non-beautiful.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive identical elements and finds the minimum count of consecutive identical elements.
   - Finally, it prints this minimum count as the answer.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Case 1: All Elements are the Same**
     - If all elements are the same, the code correctly prints `-1`.
   - **Case 2: Array is Beautiful but Not All Elements are the Same**
     - The code correctly identifies the minimum number of consecutive identical elements.
     - However, the logic for finding the minimum number of consecutive identical elements is flawed. The code only counts consecutive identical elements starting from the first element and does not consider the possibility of removing elements to break the beauty condition effectively.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The code handles the edge case where all elements are the same correctly.
     - The code does not handle the case where the array is not beautiful, which is not required according to the problem statement.

4. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - Consider the example provided in the problem description:
     - **Input**:
       ```
       4
       3
       2 2 2
       5
       1 2 1 2 1
       1
       1
       7
       3 3 3 5 3 3 3
       ```
     - **Expected Output**:
       ```
       -1
       1
       -1
       3
       ```
     - **Actual Output**:
       - For the second test case, the code outputs `1`, which is correct.
       - For the fourth test case, the code outputs `3`, which is also correct.
     - However, the code fails to handle the first and third test cases correctly. For the first test case, the code should output `-1` because the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Similarly, for the third test case, the code should output `-1` because the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The code only considers consecutive identical elements starting from the first element and does not account for the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing elements in a different manner.
