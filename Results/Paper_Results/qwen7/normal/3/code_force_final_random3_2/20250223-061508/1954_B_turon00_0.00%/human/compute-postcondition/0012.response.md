Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the loop head, but it will start from 0.
   - `n` is given as an input integer.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
   - Therefore, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `ans`, `t`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `cnt` are not relevant to the loop's execution condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`n` must be greater than 0**
