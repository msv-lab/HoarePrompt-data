Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `cnt` is `cnt` + 1**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `cnt`, we only know that `cnt` has been increased by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
