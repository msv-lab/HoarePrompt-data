Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `_` (a dummy variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer.
   - Since `t` is defined as `int(input())`, it is an integer input from the user.
   - The precondition given is \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - The state before the loop starts is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within this range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
