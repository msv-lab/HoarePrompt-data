Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
2. The annotated program correctly identifies that if all elements in the array are the same, the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, hence the output should be `-1`.
3. For other cases, the program iterates through the array and counts consecutive occurrences of the same element. It keeps track of the minimum count of such consecutive occurrences.
4. The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is sound. By counting consecutive occurrences, the program can identify the smallest segment that needs to be removed to break the beauty condition.
5. The program handles multiple test cases as required and outputs the correct result for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
