Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is `ans`, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, and `a[0]` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a[0]`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
