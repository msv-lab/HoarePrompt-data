Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list, `tmp` is an integer. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is set to 0 and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`.
