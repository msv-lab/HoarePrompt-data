Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables mentioned in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 2`.
   - **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is defined before the loop.

4. **Postconditions**:
   - `tmp` is an integer.
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `a[i] == tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is set to 0.
   - `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.

Since the postconditions (`tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans`) are not directly affected by the loop head (they are modified inside the loop body), they do not need to be adjusted here.

Therefore, the only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `n`.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
- `i` should be `i_prev + 2`.
- `n` remains the same.

Given the initial conditions where `i` is `i_prev + 1` and `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 1` (since the loop starts from `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 each time):

**State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `a[i] == tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is set to 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 2`**.
