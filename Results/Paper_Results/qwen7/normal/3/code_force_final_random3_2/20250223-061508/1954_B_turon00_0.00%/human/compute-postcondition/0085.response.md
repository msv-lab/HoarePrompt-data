Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is `ans`.
   - If `a[0]` equals `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is 0.

3. **Determine the changes for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is set to `ans` at the beginning of the loop and does not change within the loop body based on the given information.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains `ans`.

5. **Consider the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now 1 and `n` is `ans`, the loop will continue if `ans` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is `ans`**.
