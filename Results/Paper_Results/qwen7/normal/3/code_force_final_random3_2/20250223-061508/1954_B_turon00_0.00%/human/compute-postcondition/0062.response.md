Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `ans` remains as the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is now explicitly set to 0, this is included in the output state.
