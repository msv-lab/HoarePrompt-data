Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is `ans`, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. Since `ans` was previously defined as the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is now 0, `ans` remains unchanged (assuming `ans` was not less than 0 before). The values of `i` and `n` remain the same as their initial states.
