Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, `ans` will be the minimum value encountered for `cnt` during the loop execution, `cnt` will be 0, and `tmp` will retain its initial value.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the end of the list `a` (i.e., `i` will be equal to `n`). The variable `ans` will hold the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution. The variable `cnt` will be reset to 0 after the loop ends because it is reset to 0 whenever `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`. The variable `tmp` will remain unchanged as it is only used to compare with elements in the list `a` and is not modified within the loop.
