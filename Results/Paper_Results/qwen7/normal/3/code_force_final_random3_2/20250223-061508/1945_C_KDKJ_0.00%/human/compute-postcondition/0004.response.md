Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.
   - `func_1()` has been called.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer.
   - Since the loop uses `_` as the loop variable (which is typically used when the loop variable is not needed), the exact value of the input does not matter for the loop itself, but it must be a valid positive integer for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input to the `int(input())` function. However, since the problem specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and there are no other variables in the loop head besides the loop control variable `_`, we focus on ensuring that the loop can continue.

Since the loop control variable `_` is not used, the key is to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is a valid positive integer. Given the constraints, we assume that the input will be a valid positive integer for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state remains the same in terms of `n` and `a`, and `func_1()` has already been called.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `func_1()` has been called.**
