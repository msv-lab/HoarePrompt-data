Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `func_1()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code snippet `func_1()` is called, but since no specific details about what `func_1()` does are provided, the values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. The only thing that happens is the execution of `func_1()`. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `n` and `a`, along with the fact that `func_1()` has been called.
