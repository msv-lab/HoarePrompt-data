Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop when you don't need to use the value of the iterator. It is typically set to the value returned by `range(int(input()))`.
   - `int(input())`: This is the actual value that determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.
   - The input provided by `int(input())` must be a positive integer.
   - `func_1()` has been called.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if the value of `int(input())` is greater than 0 (since it must be a positive integer).
   - After each iteration, the value of `_` is incremented by 1, but since `_` is just a placeholder, we don't need to explicitly adjust its state.
   - The key variable that controls the loop is `int(input())`. For the loop to execute again, this value must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())` to ensure the loop can execute again. Since the loop body is omitted, we assume the input will be provided again and must be a positive integer.

**Final State**:
- `n` remains the same as it was not modified in the loop body.
- `a` remains the same as it was not modified in the loop body.
- The input provided by `int(input())` must now be a positive integer for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', the input provided by `int(input())` must be a positive integer, and `func_1()` has been called.**
