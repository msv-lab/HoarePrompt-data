Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of houses, and `a`, a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether it's possible to arrange the residents such that all residents who prefer to live on the left side are on the left, and all residents who prefer to live on the right side are on the right.**

This means the function checks if the string `a` can be divided into two parts: one part containing all '0's (indicating left preference) at the beginning and the other part containing all '1's (indicating right preference) at the end. If this arrangement is possible, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
