Output State: **`i` is 0; `left` is `S[0][0]`; `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`. The condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` is true.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement, the values of `i`, `left`, `lsum`, and `rsum` remain unchanged. The condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` also remains true.
