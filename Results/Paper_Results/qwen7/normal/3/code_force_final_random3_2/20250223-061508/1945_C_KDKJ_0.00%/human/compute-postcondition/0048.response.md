Output State: **`i` is 1, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`, `ans` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`, `rsum` is updated to `n - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rsum` to `n - lsum`. Given that `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, the new value of `rsum` becomes `n - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
