Output State: **`i` is 0; `left` is `S[0][0]`; `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`.**

The code updates the variable `rsum` to be the value of `n - lsum`. Given that `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, the new value of `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`. All other variables (`i`, `left`, and `lsum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
