Output State: `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `func_1()` has been called three times.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` remains an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. Additionally, `func_1()` has been called three times as specified by the loop condition. The state of these variables does not change during the loop's execution; they retain their initial conditions except for the number of times `func_1()` has been called, which is now three.
