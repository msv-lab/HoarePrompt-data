Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `left` is `S[1][0]`
   - `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`
   - `rsum` is `n - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`
   - `ans` is either 0 or 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.

5. **Adjusting Other States:**
   - The values of `left`, `lsum`, `rsum`, and `ans` depend on the value of `i`.
   - Since `i` is now 2, we need to update these values based on the new `i`.

6. **Calculating New Values:**
   - `left` will be `S[2][0]`
   - `lsum` will be `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`
   - `rsum` will be `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`
   - `ans` will remain either 0 or 1 unless the conditions in the postcondition change.

7. **Postcondition Check:**
   - If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, then `ans` remains 0.
   - Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans` is greater than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and 1, then `ans` is updated to 1.

Given that the loop is about to start its next iteration with `i = 2`, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` becomes 2
- `left` becomes `S[2][0]`
- `lsum` becomes `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`
- `rsum` becomes `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`
- `ans` remains either 0 or 1 unless the postcondition changes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`, and `ans` is either 0 or 1**.
