Output State: **`i` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[2][1])`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`**.

The code updates the variable `right` to be `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. Given that `i` is 2, `right` is calculated as `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`. The other variables (`i`, `left`, `lsum`, `rsum`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
