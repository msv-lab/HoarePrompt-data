Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `S` is a list containing a single sublist [0, 0]
Code of the loop:
for s in a:
    x, y = S[-1]
    if s == '0':
        x += 1
    else:
        y += 1
    S.append([x, y])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `S` is a list containing either [x+1, y] or [x, y+1] depending on the first character of `a`; `x` is incremented by 1 if the first character of `a` is '0', otherwise `y` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; if `s` is '0', then `x` is equal to the last element of the list `S`[0] plus 1 and `y` is equal to the last element of the list `S`[1]; otherwise, `x` is equal to the last element of the list `S`[0] and `y` is equal to the last element of the list `S`[1] plus 1; `S` is now `[S[0], S[1], [x, y]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a non-empty string of length `n-1` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the current character in the string `a`; `x` is the last element of the list `S[1]` plus 1; `y` is the last element of the list `S[0]` plus 1; `S` is now `[S[0], S[1], [x, y]]`, and the list `S` is appended with `[x, y]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
