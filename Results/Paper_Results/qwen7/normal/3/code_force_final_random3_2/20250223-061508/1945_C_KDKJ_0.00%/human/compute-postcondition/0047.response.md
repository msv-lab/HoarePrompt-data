Output State: **`i` is 1, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`, `ans` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]**.

Explanation: The variable `right` is assigned the value `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `S[i][1]` becomes `S[1][1]`. Therefore, `right` is updated to `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`. The values of `i`, `left`, `lsum`, `rsum`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
