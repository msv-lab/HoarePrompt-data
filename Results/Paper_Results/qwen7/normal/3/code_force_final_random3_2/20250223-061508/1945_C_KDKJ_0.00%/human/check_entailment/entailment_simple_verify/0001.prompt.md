You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a
big road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident
wants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is
described as a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident
of the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,
a_j = 1 .

The road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be
declared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the
right-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then
the houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the
street, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road
also may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the
entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.

To make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half
of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.
That is, among x residents on one side, at least \lceil\frac{x}{2}\rceil
should want to live on that side, where \lceil x \rceil denotes rounding up a
real number x .

To the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j
there must be at least \lceil\frac{i}{2}\rceil zeros. To the right of the
road, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at
least \lceil\frac{n-i}{2}\rceil ones.

Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the
described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
Formally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \left|\frac{n}{2} -
i\right| .

If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \left|\frac{n}{2}
- i\right| , output the smaller one.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le
3\cdot 10^5 ). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n
, consisting only of 0 and 1 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number i — the position of the house after
which the road should be laid (if it should be laid before the first house,
output 0 ). We can show that the answer always exists.

Note

Let's consider the first example of input data.

If we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on
the left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the
right side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be
satisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after
house 1 .

If we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left
side (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the
right side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More
than half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which
means that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the
optimal answer.

Specifically, `S[i][0]` represents the total count of '0's and `S[i][1]` represents the total count of '1's in `a`. The list `S` will have a length equal to `n + 1`, with the last element being the counts of '0's and '1's in the entire string `a`.

    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have the value of `n-1` since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The variables `left`, `lsum`, and `rsum` will hold the values corresponding to the last element in the list `S`. The variable `ans` will be the index `i` that meets the specified conditions during the loop's execution. Given the nature of the conditions checked within the loop, `ans` will be the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2` while also satisfying the balance condition involving `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum`.

    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` remains an integer within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. Additionally, `func_1()` has been called three times as specified by the loop condition. The state of these variables does not change during the loop's execution; they retain their initial conditions except for the number of times `func_1()` has been called, which is now three.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides are satisfied.
   - The position `i` should be as close to the middle of the village (`n/2`) as possible.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code defines a function `func_1()` that processes one test case.
   - It reads the number of houses `n` and the sequence `a` representing the residents' preferences.
   - It uses a list `S` to store the cumulative counts of 0s and 1s up to each house.
   - For each house `i`, it calculates the number of residents on the left (`left`) and right (`right`) sides.
   - It checks if placing the road after house `i` satisfies the condition (at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied).
   - If the condition is met, it updates the answer `ans` if the current position is closer to the middle or has the same distance but is smaller.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the cumulative counts and checking the satisfaction condition is correct.
   - The loop iterates through all positions and correctly identifies the best position `i`.
   - The use of `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)` ensures that the closest position to the middle is chosen, and in case of ties, the smaller index is selected.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the entire village prefers one side (all 0s or all 1s), ensuring the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house if necessary.

5. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.

Given the analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.
