You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is calculated based on the formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` starting from `i = n - 2` down to `i = 0`, `i` is now -1 (since it is decremented until it becomes less than 0).
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans[0]` will contain the final computed value, and all other elements in `ans` will also be updated according to the given formula. The variable `i` will be set to -1 because the loop continues to decrement `i` until it is no longer greater than or equal to 0.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length n where each element is calculated based on the formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` starting from `i = n - 2` down to `i = 0`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` is not defined as there is no `ans[n]`. The variable `i` is set to -1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. Let's consider a few test cases to illustrate this:

1. **Test Case**: 
   ```
   4
   2 4 1
   ```

   According to the problem description, we need to find an array `a` such that:
   - \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2 \)
   - \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4 \)
   - \( a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1 \)

   The current implementation sets `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, which does not guarantee that the conditions will be met. For example, if `arr = [2, 4, 1]`, setting `ans[2] = ans[3] - 1` would not necessarily satisfy \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4 \).

   A correct approach would involve ensuring that each `a_i` is chosen such that the modulo condition is satisfied. One possible correct solution could be:
   - \( a_1 = 5 \)
   - \( a_2 = 5 \)
   - \( a_3 = 5 \)
   - \( a_4 = 9 \)

   This satisfies:
   - \( 5 \bmod 5 = 0 \neq 2 \)
   - \( 5 \bmod 5 = 0 \neq 4 \)
   - \( 9 \bmod 5 = 4 \)

   Therefore, the current implementation fails to meet the conditions for this test case, making the program incorrect.
