Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` of length n where each element is calculated based on the formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` starting from `i = n - 2` down to `i = 0`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` is not defined as there is no `ans[n]`. The variable `i` is set to -1.**

This means that after executing the code, the list `ans` will have been filled according to the given formula, and the variable `i` will be -1. The first element of `ans` (`ans[0]`) will contain the final computed value, and all other elements will be updated accordingly.
