Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing an array \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\). The given solution attempts to construct this array using the formula \(a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i\).

2. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function initializes an array `ans` with all elements set to \(10^9\).
   - It then iterates backward from \(i = n - 2\) to \(i = 0\), setting each element \(ans[i]\) to \(ans[i + 1] - x_i\).
   - This logic aims to ensure that the modulo condition is satisfied.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints specify that \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\) and \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).
   - The values in `ans` are capped at \(10^9\), ensuring they do not overflow.
   - The approach of setting \(a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i\) is a valid way to satisfy the modulo condition, assuming \(a_{i+1} > x_i\), which is always true since \(a_{i+1}\) is initialized to \(10^9\) and \(x_i\) is at most 500.

4. **Verification**:
   - The provided example and the general logic of the function suggest that the constructed array `ans` satisfies the required conditions.
   - The function correctly handles the backward iteration and the modulo condition.

Given the analysis, the function logic aligns with the problem requirements and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
