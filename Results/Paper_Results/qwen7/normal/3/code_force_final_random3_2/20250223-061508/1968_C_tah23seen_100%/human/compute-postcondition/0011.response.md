Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except `ans[0]` which is the result of subtracting the elements of `arr` in a cascading manner (i.e., `ans[1] - arr[0], ans[2] - arr[1] - arr[0], ...`), `i` is now -1.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans[0]` will hold the final computed value based on the formula derived from the loop, and all other elements in the `ans` list will still be set to \(10^9\). The variable `i` will be set to -1 since it starts at \(n-2\) and decreases by 1 each iteration until it goes below 0.
