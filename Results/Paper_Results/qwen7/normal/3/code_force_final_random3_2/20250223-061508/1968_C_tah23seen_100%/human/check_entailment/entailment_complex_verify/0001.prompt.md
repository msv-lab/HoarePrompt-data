You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is calculated based on the formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` starting from `i = n - 2` down to `i = 0`, `i` is now -1 (since it is decremented until it becomes less than 0).
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans[0]` will contain the final computed value, and all other elements in `ans` will also be updated according to the given formula. The variable `i` will be set to -1 because the loop continues to decrement `i` until it is no longer greater than or equal to 0.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length n where each element is calculated based on the formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` starting from `i = n - 2` down to `i = 0`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` is not defined as there is no `ans[n]`. The variable `i` is set to -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It calculates a new list `ans` of length `n` where each element is determined by the formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` starting from the second last index of `ans` down to the first index. After the calculation, the function returns the list `ans`. The last element of `ans` (`ans[n-1]`) is not defined as there is no corresponding `ans[n]`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find an array \(a\) such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\). Given the constraints and the provided solution, we need to verify if the logic used in `func_1` correctly generates such an array \(a\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` with all elements set to \(10^9\).
   - It then iterates backward from \(n-2\) to \(0\) and updates each element of `ans` based on the previous element and the corresponding value in `arr`.
   - Specifically, it sets \(a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i\), which is a direct attempt to satisfy the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i+1}\).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The initialization of `ans` with \(10^9\) ensures that each \(a_i\) starts sufficiently large.
   - The backward iteration and updating logic should theoretically work if the initial assumption holds true. However, let's consider the correctness of this approach:
     - If \(a_{i+1} - x_i\) results in a value less than \(a_{i+1}\), it might not always guarantee the correct modulo operation.
     - The logic assumes that \(a_i\) can be derived directly from \(a_{i+1}\) and \(x_i\), but it doesn't ensure that the derived \(a_i\) will satisfy the modulo condition for all preceding elements.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input: `n = 3`, `arr = [2, 4]`. According to the problem, \(x_2 = 2\) and \(x_3 = 4\).
   - Using the provided logic, `ans[0] = 10^9`, `ans[1] = 10^9 - 2 = 999999998`, and `ans[2] = 999999998 - 4 = 999999994`.
   - However, \(999999994 \bmod 999999998 \neq 4\), so this approach fails to produce a correct solution.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs due to the potential issues with the backward updating logic and the modulo operation.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
