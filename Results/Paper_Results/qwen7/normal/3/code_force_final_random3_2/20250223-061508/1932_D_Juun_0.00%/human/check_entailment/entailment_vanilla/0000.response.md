Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and initializes the necessary variables.
   - `func_1` is called for each test case, which handles the actual logic for each test case.

2. **Trick Suit Handling**:
   - The program correctly identifies the trump suit and stores it.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `suits` to keep track of the highest rank for each non-trump suit.

3. **Processing Cards**:
   - The program processes each card by splitting it into rank and suit.
   - If the card is a trump card, it appends the rank to the `trumps` list.
   - If the card is a non-trump card and there is already a highest rank stored for that suit, it adds a valid move to `answers` and updates the highest rank for that suit.
   - Otherwise, it updates the highest rank for that suit.

4. **Handling Remaining Non-Trump Cards**:
   - After processing all cards, the program checks if there are any remaining non-trump cards.
   - If there are no remaining non-trump cards and there are still trump cards left, it attempts to pair them up.
   - If there are no valid pairs, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".

5. **Output Generation**:
   - The program generates the output by printing the valid moves stored in `answers` and any remaining trump card pairs.

Given the steps above, the program correctly implements the logic to handle the constraints and generate valid sequences of moves for the card game. The program accounts for all edge cases, such as when there are no valid non-trump moves or when the remaining cards cannot form valid pairs.

Correctness: **True**
