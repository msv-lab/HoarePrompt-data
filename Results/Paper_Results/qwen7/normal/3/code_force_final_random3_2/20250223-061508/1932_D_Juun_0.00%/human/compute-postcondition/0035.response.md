Output State: **`card` is split into `rank` and `suit`; `trumps` remains unchanged; `answers` is appended with a string ' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted(['None', rank])]), `suits[suit]` is None.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `suits[suit]` to `None`. All other variables remain in their initial state. The list comprehension inside `answers` will now sort between `'None'` and `rank`, and append the result to `answers`.
