Postcondition: `trumps` and `answers` are as follows: if `suit` is equal to `trumps`, then `trumps` is updated to the value of `rank`. In this case, `answers` remains the same. Otherwise, `answers` contains one additional element `' '.join([('hearts', rank), ('diamonds', rank)])` if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None` if it was not `None`. If `suits[suit]` was `None`, it is set to `rank`. `rank` is the first element of `card`, and `suit` is the second element of `card`.
