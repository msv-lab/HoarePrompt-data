Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program correctly identifies the trump suit and processes the cards according to the given rules.
3. The logic for determining the sequence of moves is as follows:
   - Cards of the trump suit are matched against other cards of the same suit.
   - Non-trump cards are matched against each other, and the higher-ranked card wins.
   - If a non-trump card cannot be matched, the program checks if there are remaining trumps that can beat the non-trump card.
   - If there are no possible matches, the program outputs "IMPOSSIBLE".
4. The program handles all edge cases, such as when there are no remaining trumps after processing all cards, and it correctly formats the output as required.
5. The overall structure and logic of the program align with the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
