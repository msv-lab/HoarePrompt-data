Postcondition: `card` is split into `rank` and `suit`; `trumps` and `answers` may change based on the following conditions:
- If `suit` equals `trump`, then `trumps` now contains the value of `rank` appended to it, and `answers` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is `None`, `answers` is appended with a string formed by joining `rank` and `suit` in sorted order.
- Otherwise, `suits[suit]` is assigned the value of `rank`.
