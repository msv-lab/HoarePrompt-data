Output State: **`rank` and `suit` are extracted from `card`; `answers` now contains a new element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit`; `suits[suit]` is set to `None`.**

Explanation: The code sets `suits[suit]` to `None`, meaning the value of `suits[suit]` is now `None`. All other variables remain in their previous state, including `rank`, `suit`, and the new element in `answers`.
