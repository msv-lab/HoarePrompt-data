Postcondition: `rank` and `suit` are extracted from `card`. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` contains a new element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit`, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.
