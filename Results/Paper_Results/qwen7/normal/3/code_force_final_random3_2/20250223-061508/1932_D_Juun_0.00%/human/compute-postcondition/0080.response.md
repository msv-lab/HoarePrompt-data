Output State: `suits` is an empty dictionary, `trumps` is an empty list, and `answers` is a list containing strings formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump' for each iteration executed.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list because the `while` loop continues to pop elements from `trumps` until it is empty. The `suits` dictionary remains empty as there are no operations that modify it within the loop. The `answers` list collects the printed statements from each iteration of the loop, which follow the format 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'.
