Postcondition: `card` is split into `rank` and `suit`; `trumps` and `answers` are modified as follows: 
- If `suit` equals `trump`, then `trumps` now contains the value of `rank` appended to it, and `answers` remains unchanged.
- If `suit` does not equal `trump`, then `trumps` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `suits[suit]` is `None`, `answers` is appended with a string formed by joining elements from a list where each element is a string concatenation of `x` and `suit` (with `x` being either `'None'` or `rank`), sorted in ascending order. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `suits[suit]` is assigned the value of `rank`.
