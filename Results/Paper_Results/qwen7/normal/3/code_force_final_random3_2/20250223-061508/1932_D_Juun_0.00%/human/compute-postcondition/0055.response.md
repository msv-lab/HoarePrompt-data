Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element, `answers` is a list with one additional element where the last element is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump', and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement in the code does not change any variable values but instead moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `suits`, `trumps`, and `answers` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only effect is that the loop or iteration continues.
