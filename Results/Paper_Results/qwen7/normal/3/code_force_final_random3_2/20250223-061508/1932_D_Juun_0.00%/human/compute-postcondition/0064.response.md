Output State: **`suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one less element, `answers` is a list with two additional elements where the last element is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump' and the second last element is the previous last element, and we continue the loop or process.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided, the `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables `suits`, `trumps`, or `answers`. It simply indicates that the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop (if there was one) or move on to the next part of the code outside the loop.
