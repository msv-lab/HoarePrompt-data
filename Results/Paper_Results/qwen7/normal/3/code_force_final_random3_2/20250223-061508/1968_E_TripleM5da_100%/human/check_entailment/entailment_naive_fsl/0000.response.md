Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, for \( n > 2 \), the program only prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) and then a series of coordinates (i, i) from 3 to n. However, the problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances, and the given solution does not guarantee the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \( n \).

For example, consider \( n = 3 \). The optimal arrangement should include cells such as (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1) to achieve the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\), which is 3. However, the provided program only includes (1, 1) and (1, 2), leading to a smaller set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
