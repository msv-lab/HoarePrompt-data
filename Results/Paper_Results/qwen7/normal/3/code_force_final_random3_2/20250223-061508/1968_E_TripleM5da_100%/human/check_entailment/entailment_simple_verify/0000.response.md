### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Initial Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).

2. **Output Generation:**
   - The program prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for every test case.
   - Then, it prints coordinates (i, i) for \( i \) ranging from 3 to \( n \).

3. **Annotated Code Explanation:**
   - After the loop, the loop variable `i` will be \( 2 * n - 1 \).
   - This means the loop runs until \( i = n + 2 \), covering all values from 3 to \( n \).
   - The variable `n` must be at least 11 for the loop to run the maximum number of times required to reach \( i = 2 * n - 1 \).

4. **Behavior Analysis:**
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - The program prints (1, 1) and (1, 2).
     - The Manhattan distances are \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \) and \( |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 \), resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0\}\).
     - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 1, which is correct but not maximal for \( n = 2 \) (the maximal size is 2).

   - For \( n > 2 \):
     - The program prints (1, 1) and (1, 2), followed by (i, i) for \( i \) from 3 to \( n \).
     - The Manhattan distances include:
       - Distances involving (1, 1) and (1, 2): \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \), \( |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 \), \( |1-2| + |1-1| = 1 \), \( |1-2| + |2-2| = 1 \).
       - Distances involving (i, i) for \( i \geq 3 \): \( |i-i| + |1-1| = 0 \), \( |i-i| + |2-2| = 0 \), \( |i-i| + |1-2| = 1 \), etc.
     - The unique distances are \( \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\} \), resulting in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).
     - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \( n \), which is maximal for \( n > 2 \).

5. **Comparison with Optimal Solution:**
   - The optimal solution for \( n = 3 \) should include cells like (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1) to achieve \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
   - The given program does not include these cells, leading to a smaller set of distinct Manhattan distances.

### Conclusion:
The program does not generate the optimal set of coordinates for all \( n \). While it correctly handles \( n = 2 \) and \( n > 2 \) to some extent, it fails to maximize \(\mathcal{H}\) for all cases, especially for small \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
