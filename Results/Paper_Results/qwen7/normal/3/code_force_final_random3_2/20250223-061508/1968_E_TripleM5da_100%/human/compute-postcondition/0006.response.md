Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` must be 3.

The `print(i, i)` statement will print the value of `i` twice.

Since it is explicitly stated that `i` must be 3, the value of `i` is precisely 3.

Output: **3 3**
