Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(3, n + 1):` will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 3 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `i` must be 3.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 3` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 4.

5. **Check if the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be within the range defined by `range(3, n + 1)`.
   - Given that `i` is now 4, the condition `3 <= i < n + 1` must hold true.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` changes to 4.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**.
