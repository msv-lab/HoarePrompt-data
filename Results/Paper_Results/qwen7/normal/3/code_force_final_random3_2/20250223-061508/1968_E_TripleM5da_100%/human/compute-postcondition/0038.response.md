Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 11, `n` must be at least 11.

Explanation: The loop starts with `i` set to 3 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. After 3 iterations, `i` is 10. Therefore, for the loop to execute all its iterations, `n` must be at least 10. After all iterations are completed, `i` will be one more than the final value of `n`, which means `i` will be 11. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
