Functionality: **The function processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). It prints a sequence of numbers starting with (1, 1) followed by (1, 2), and then a series of pairs (i, i) for `i` ranging from 3 to `n` (inclusive). After processing, the loop variable `i` equals `2 * n - 1`, and `n` must be at least 11 for the loop to run the maximum number of times. The function does not return any value.**
