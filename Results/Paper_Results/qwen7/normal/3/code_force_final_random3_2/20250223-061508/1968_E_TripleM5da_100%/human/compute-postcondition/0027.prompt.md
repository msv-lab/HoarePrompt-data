Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 7, `n` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    print(i, i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 7, `n` must be greater than or equal to 7

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n` in the statement `for i in range(3, n + 1):`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `i` is 7.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 7.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 3 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` is currently 7, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 7.

Given these points, we need to update the state as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `i` will be incremented by 1 to 8 for the next iteration.
- `n` must be greater than 7 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 8, `n` must be greater than 7**

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 8, `n` must be greater than 7




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
