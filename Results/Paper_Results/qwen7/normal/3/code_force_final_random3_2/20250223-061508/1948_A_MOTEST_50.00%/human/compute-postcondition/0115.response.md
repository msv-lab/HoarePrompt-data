Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` is between 1 and 50 inclusive. Depending on the values of `t` and `n`, the function returns either an error message if `t` is out of range, or a specific value if `n` is within the specified range.**
