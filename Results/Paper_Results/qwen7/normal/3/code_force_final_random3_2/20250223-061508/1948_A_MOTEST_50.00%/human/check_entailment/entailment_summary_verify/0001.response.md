### Reasoning

The original program has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Handling Odd `n`:**
   - The program starts with "AAA" when `n` is odd, which violates the condition that a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is incorrect.

2. **String Length Constraint:**
   - The program does not ensure that the constructed string does not exceed the maximum allowed length of 200 characters, especially when `n` is large.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the constructed string exceeds the length limit of 200 characters.

After analyzing the corrected version provided, the new logic ensures that:
- For even `n`, it constructs the string by alternating characters from the uppercase alphabet.
- For odd `n`, it constructs the string similarly but ensures the string does not exceed 200 characters by adding additional characters as needed.

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and ensures that the constructed string meets the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The corrected program now correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the constructed string meets the problem requirements.
