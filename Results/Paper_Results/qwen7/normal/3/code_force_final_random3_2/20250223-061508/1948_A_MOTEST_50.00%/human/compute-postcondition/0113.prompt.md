Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `s` is a string containing 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `os.system('cls')` has been called.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        ans = ''
        x = 0
        if n % 2 == 0:
            for j in range(n // 2):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        else:
            ans, x = 'AAA', 1
            for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        print('YES')
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is either 1 or 3, `n` is the original input integer and is not equal to 1, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated `n` times, `x` is `n // 2`, and `j` is `n // 2` if `n` is even; otherwise, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus 6 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 3, `j` is increased by 2, and `i` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2 if `t` was 1 or 4 if `t` was 3, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated `n` times, `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2` if `n` is even; otherwise, if `n` equals 1, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated `n` times plus 6 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 3, `j` is increased by 2, if `n` is at least 2, `ans` is increased by `s[x] * 2` for each iteration of the loop, `x` is increased by 2 for each iteration, and `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1` when the loop ends, and if `n` is even, `x` is 7 and `j` is 3 after the loop, otherwise, `ans` is 's[4]s[4]' + 's[4]' * 6.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` is an integer. If `n` is 1, the postcondition remains as the precondition. Otherwise, if `n` is even, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `x` is `n // 2`, and `ans` is the concatenation of `'s[i]*2'` for all `i` from `0` to `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and at least 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `ans` is 'A' multiplied by `(n // 2 - 1) * 2`, and `x` is `n // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
