Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `x` is 1, `ans` is 's[0]*2' + 's[1]*2'**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `s[x] * 2`. Given that `x` is initially 1, `ans` is updated to be `'s[0]*2' + 's[1]*2'`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
