Postcondition: `n` is an integer. If `n` is 1, there are no changes to other variables. If `n` is even, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `x` is `n // 2`, and `ans` is the concatenation of `'s[i]*2'` for all `i` from `0` to `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and at least 3, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `ans` is 'A' multiplied by `(n // 2 - 1) * 2`, and `x` is `n // 2`.
