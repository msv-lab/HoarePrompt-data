The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Initially, `x` is 3, so after executing `x += 1`, the value of `x` becomes 4. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2 if `t` was 1 or 4 if `t` was 3, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is 's[x]s[x]', `x` is 4, `j` is 0**
