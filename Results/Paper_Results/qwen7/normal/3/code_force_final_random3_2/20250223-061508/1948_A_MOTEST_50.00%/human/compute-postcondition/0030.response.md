Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n // 2 - 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is increased by `2 * s[x]`.
   - `x` is increased by 1.
   - `j` is increased by 1.
   - `s` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < n // 2 - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was increased by 1. Therefore, `j` is now `previous_j + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n // 2 - 1`. Hence, `j` should be set to `previous_j + 1` and checked against `n // 2 - 1`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `ans` remains unchanged.
- `x` is increased by 1.
- `j` is increased by 1.
- `s` remains unchanged.

Since the loop condition depends on `j` and `n`, we need to ensure `j` is correctly adjusted for the next iteration.

**Final State**:
- `ans` is increased by `2 * s[x]`.
- `x` is increased by 1.
- `j` is increased by 1.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `j` must be less than `n // 2 - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is increased by `2 * s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, `s` remains unchanged, `j` must be less than `n // 2 - 1`**.
