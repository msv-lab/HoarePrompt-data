Output State: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2 if `t` was 1 or 4 if `t` was 3, `n` must be at least 3, `ans` is 's[4]s[4]' + 's[4]' * 6, `x` is 7, `j` is 3.

Explanation: The loop runs for `n // 2` times. From the given information, we know that after 3 iterations of the loop, `x` is 6 and `j` is 2. Since `j` increments by 1 in each iteration, after all iterations, `j` will be `n // 2`. Also, `ans` accumulates `s[x] * 2` in each iteration, so after `n // 2` iterations, `ans` will be 's[4]s[4]' repeated `n // 2` times. Given that `n` must be at least 3, after all iterations, `x` will be `n // 2 + 3` (since it starts from 3 and increments by 1 in each iteration), and `ans` will be 's[4]s[4]' + 's[4]' * 6 (as 3 iterations were done and each iteration adds 's[4]' twice).
