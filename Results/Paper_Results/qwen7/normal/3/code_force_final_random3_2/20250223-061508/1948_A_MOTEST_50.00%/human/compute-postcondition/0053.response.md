Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2 if `t` was 1 or 4 if `t` was 3, `n` must be at least 3, `ans` is 's[4]s[4]' + 's[4]' * 4, `x` is 5, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` adds twice the value of `s[x]` (which is `s[5]`) to `ans`. Since `ans` was originally `'s[4]s[4]' + 's[4]' * 2`, which simplifies to `'s[4]s[4]s[4]s[4]'`, adding `s[5]s[5]` (twice the value of `s[5]`) results in `'s[4]s[4]s[4]s[4]s[5]s[5]'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
