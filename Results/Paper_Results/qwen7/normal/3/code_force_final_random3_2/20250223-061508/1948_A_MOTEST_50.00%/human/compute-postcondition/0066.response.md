Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n // 2 - 1)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is increased by `s[x] * 2`.
   - `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1`.
   - `x` is increased by 1 (so `x` is now `x + 1`).
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 (so `j` is now `j + 1`).

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `j < n // 2 - 1`, for the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n // 2 - 1` after the increment.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was less than `n // 2 - 1`, and it was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` must be less than `n // 2 - 1` again, but now `j` is `j + 1`.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `x` is increased by 1, so `x` is now `x + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n // 2 - 1` after the increment.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `x` is now `x + 1`.
- `j` is now `j + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n // 2 - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is increased by `s[x] * 2`, `x` is `x + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1`, `j` is `j + 1`**.

However, since `j` is already incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, the condition for the next iteration is simply `j < n // 2 - 1`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`ans` is increased by `s[x] * 2`, `x` is `x + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1`**.
