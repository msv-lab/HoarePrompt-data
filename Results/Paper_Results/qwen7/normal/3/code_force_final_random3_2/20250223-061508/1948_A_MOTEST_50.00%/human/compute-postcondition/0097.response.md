Output State: **`n` is an odd number and at least 3, `j` is 0, `ans` is 'AAAS', `x` is 1**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the value of `ans` by appending twice the character at index `x` of the string `s`. Given that `x` is 1, it appends `s[1] * 2` to `ans`. Since the initial value of `ans` is 'AAA', appending twice the character at index 1 (assuming `s` is 'AAA') results in 'AAAS'. The values of `n`, `j`, and `x` remain unchanged.
