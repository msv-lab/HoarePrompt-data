Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2 if `t` was 1 or 4 if `t` was 3, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is incremented by `s[x] * 2` for each iteration of the loop, `x` is increased by 2 for each iteration, and `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1` when the loop ends. If `n` is even, `ans` is 's[4]s[4]' + 's[4]' * 6 after 3 iterations, otherwise `ans` is increased by `s[x] * 2` for each iteration.
