Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `t` used in the `range()` function.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

4. **Adjust the State of `t`**: Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop will continue as long as `i < t`, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Other Variables**: The variables `s` and the call to `os.system('cls')` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- `i` starts at 0.

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
