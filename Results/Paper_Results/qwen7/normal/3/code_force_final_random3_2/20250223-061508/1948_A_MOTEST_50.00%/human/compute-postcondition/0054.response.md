The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Initially, `x` is 5, so after the increment, `x` becomes 6. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `ans`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as they were.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2 if `t` was 1 or 4 if `t` was 3, `n` must be at least 3, `ans` is 's[4]s[4]' + 's[4]' * 4, `x` is 6, `j` is 2**
