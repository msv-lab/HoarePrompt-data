Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is "0", `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f - 2`, and `q` is 1 if `k` is a power of 2, otherwise `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `f` is 0.**
