Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines several variables:
   - `i` is set to 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., `k = abs(n - m)`.
   - `l` is set to "0".
   - `p` is set to 1.
   - `q` is set to 2.

2. The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`.

3. Since `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and both `n` and `m` are input integers, the exact value of `k` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`.

4. Without knowing the exact values of `n` and `m`, we cannot determine the precise numerical value of `k`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
