Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must not be 2, `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2, `f` is `k - 2`, `p` is calculated as the length of `l`**.

Explanation: The code `p = len(l)` calculates the length of the string `l`, which is the binary representation of `k - 2` (without the '0b' prefix). This length is stored in `p`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
