Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is not divisible by 2, then `k` is not a power of 2, `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2, and `f` is 0.**
