Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is '0b11', `p` is 3, `q` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `p = len(l)` calculates the length of the string `l`, which is `'0b11'`. The length of `'0b11'` is 3, so `p` is updated to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
