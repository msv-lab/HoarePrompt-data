Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must not be 2, `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 **(p - 1)**, `f` is not a power of 2 and is non-zero, `l` is updated to be the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`**.

Explanation: The code `q = 2 ** (p - 1)` calculates the value of `q` as `2` raised to the power of `(p - 1)`. Since `p` is the length of `l`, and `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, the value of `q` is determined by the length of `l`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
