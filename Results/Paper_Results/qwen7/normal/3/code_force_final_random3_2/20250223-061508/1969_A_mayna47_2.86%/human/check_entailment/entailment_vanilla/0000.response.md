Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop.
   - This function should be called inside the loop, but it is currently not being called.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - Inside the loop, the function `func_1()` is supposed to be called, but it is not.

4. **Function Implementation:**
   - `func_1()` initializes a list `v` with zeros.
   - It then updates the list `v` with the best friend indices.
   - If `n == 2`, it prints `2`.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and also have each other's best friends invited. If such a pair exists, it prints `2`.
   - If no such pair exists, it prints `3`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Function Not Called:**
   - The function `func_1()` is not called within the main loop. This means the program will not process any test cases correctly.

2. **Logic for Finding Minimum Invitations:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` seems to be attempting to find pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and also have each other's best friends invited. However, this logic might not cover all edge cases, especially when the graph structure is more complex.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issues, we need to call `func_1()` within the main loop and ensure the logic is correct.

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Check if n == 2
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
        return

    # Check for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and also have each other's best friends invited
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
            print(2)
            return

    # If no such pair exists, print 3
    print(3)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not call the function `func_1()` within the main loop. After fixing this issue, the program should work correctly according to the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
