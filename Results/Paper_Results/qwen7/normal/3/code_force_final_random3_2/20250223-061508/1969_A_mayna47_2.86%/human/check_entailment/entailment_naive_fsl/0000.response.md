Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where no pair of friends can come to the party together. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3
3
2 3 1
```

In this case, no two friends can come to the party together because each friend's best friend does not receive an invitation if the friend themselves receives an invitation. However, the program always prints `2`, which is incorrect for this scenario. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
