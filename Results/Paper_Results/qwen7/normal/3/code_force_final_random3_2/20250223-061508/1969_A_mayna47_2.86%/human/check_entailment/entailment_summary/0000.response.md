Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
2. The provided program defines a single function `func_1()` which is called within a loop that iterates `t` times (where `t` is the number of test cases).
3. For each test case, the program reads `n` and a list of `n` integers `p`.
4. The program then constructs an array `v` where `v[i]` is set to `p[i-1]` (since the input list is 0-indexed but the array is 1-indexed).
5. The program checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition indicates that `i` and `v[i]` are best friends of each other.
6. If such an index is found, it means that inviting just these two friends would ensure both come to the party, so the program prints `2` and returns.
7. If no such index exists, the program prints `3` and returns, implying that at least three friends need to be invited to ensure at least two come to the party.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly identifies whether a pair of friends who are each other's best friends exist. If such a pair exists, it correctly outputs `2` because only two invitations are needed. If no such pair exists, it correctly outputs `3` because at least three invitations are needed.

Therefore, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
