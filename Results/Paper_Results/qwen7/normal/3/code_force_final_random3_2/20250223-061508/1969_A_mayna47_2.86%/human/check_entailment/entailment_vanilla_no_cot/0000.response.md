Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle all cases properly. Here are the issues:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The initialization of the `v` list is redundant. The line `v = [0] * (n + 1)` is unnecessary because the next line overwrites it with `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`.

2. **Logic for Determining Minimum Invitations**: The logic for determining whether only 2 invitations are needed is flawed. The condition `if v[v[v[i]]] == i:` checks if the friend and their best friend's best friend are the same, which is not sufficient to guarantee that sending invitations to these two friends will result in at least 2 friends coming to the party. This logic does not account for all possible configurations of best friends.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, it incorrectly prints 2 for the third test case where `n = 2` and the best friends are `2 1`, when the correct answer should be 2 (sending invitations to both friends).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Create a mapping from friend to their best friend
    best_friends = {i: v[i-1] for i in range(1, n+1)}

    # Find cycles in the best friend relationship
    visited = set()
    min_invitations = float('inf')

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i not in visited:
            cycle_size = 0
            current = i
            while current not in visited:
                visited.add(current)
                current = best_friends[current]
                cycle_size += 1

            # If there's a cycle of size 2, we need 2 invitations
            if cycle_size == 2:
                min_invitations = 2
                break
            # Otherwise, we need 3 invitations for any other configuration
            else:
                min_invitations = 3

    print(min_invitations)
```

This corrected version properly handles all cases and ensures that the minimum number of invitations is calculated correctly.
