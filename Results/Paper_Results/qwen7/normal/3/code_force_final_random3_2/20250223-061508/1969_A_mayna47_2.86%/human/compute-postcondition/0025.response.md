Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 50, `n` is an integer such that 2 < n â‰¤ 50, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`.**

In this final output state, the loop has iterated through all possible values of `i` from 1 to 50 (since the loop runs for `range(1, n + 1)` and `n` is at most 50). The condition `if v[v[v[i]]] == i:` is checked for each `i` in this range. If this condition ever evaluates to `True` during any iteration, the function would return immediately without further iterations. However, since the problem statement indicates that the loop completes all its iterations up to `i = 50` without returning, it means that for all `i` from 1 to 50, the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is always `False`. Therefore, the final value of `i` is 50, and the condition `v[v[v[i]]]` is still not equal to `i`. All other variables (`n`, `p`, and `v`) remain in their original postconditions as they were not modified within the loop.
