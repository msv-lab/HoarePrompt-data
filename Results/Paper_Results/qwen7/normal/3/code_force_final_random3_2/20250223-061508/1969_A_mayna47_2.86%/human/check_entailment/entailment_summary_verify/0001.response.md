### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the program was incorrect because the function `func_1()` was not being called for each test case. The function `func_1()` is responsible for processing each test case and determining the minimum number of invitations needed. Since the function was not being called, the logic inside `func_1()` was never executed, leading to incorrect results.

However, the original assessment did not provide the corrected version of the program. Based on the provided function summary and the problem description, the corrected version of the program should call `func_1()` for each test case. Once this is done, the program will correctly process each test case and produce the right output.

Since the original program is incorrect due to the missing function calls, but the logic inside `func_1()` is correct, the final evaluation should reflect this understanding.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not call the function `func_1()` for each test case. However, once the function calls are added, the program will be correct.
