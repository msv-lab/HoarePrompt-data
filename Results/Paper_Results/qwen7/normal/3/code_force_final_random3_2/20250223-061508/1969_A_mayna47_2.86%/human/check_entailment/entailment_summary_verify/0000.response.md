### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its function summary against the problem description and the provided examples.

1. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1()` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `p`.
   - It initializes a list `v` with zeros.
   - It updates `v` to include the indices from the input list.
   - It checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`.
     - If such an index is found, it prints `2` and returns.
     - If no such index exists, it prints `3` and returns.

2. **Program Code Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - `func_1()` performs the same operations as described in the function summary.

3. **Problem Description and Examples:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - The examples provided cover different scenarios:
     - In the first example, friends 4 and 5 can come together.
     - In the second example, friends 1, 2, and 3 can come together.
     - In the third example, friends 1 and 2 can come together.

4. **Verification of Function Summary:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1()`.
   - The function correctly identifies pairs of friends who can come to the party together by checking if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where no such pair exists by printing `3`.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where exactly one pair exists by printing `2`.

6. **Original Assessment Evaluation:**
   - The original assessment stated that the program does not handle the case where no pair of friends can come to the party together. This is incorrect because the function `func_1()` correctly prints `3` in such cases.
   - The original assessment also incorrectly claimed that the program always prints `2`, which is not true. The program prints `2` only when a pair of friends can come together, and `3` otherwise.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party. The function summary accurately reflects the behavior of the function, and the program handles all edge cases correctly.

**Final: True**
