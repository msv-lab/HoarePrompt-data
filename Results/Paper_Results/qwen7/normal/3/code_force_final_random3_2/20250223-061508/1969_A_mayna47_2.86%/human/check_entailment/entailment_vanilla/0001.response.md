Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the array `p` representing the best friends.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is a mistake because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes a list `v` with zeros.
   - It updates the list `v` with the values from the input array `p`.
   - For the special case where `n == 2`, it prints `2` directly, which is correct based on the problem statement.

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other’s best friends and also have each other’s best friends invited. If such a pair is found, it prints `2`.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == 2` correctly.
   - However, the function `func_1()` is not being called for each test case, which means the logic inside `func_1()` is not executed for any test case.

### Corrected Version

To fix the issue, we need to call `func_1()` inside the loop that processes each test case. Here is the corrected version:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
        print(3)
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect because it does not call the function `func_1()` for each test case. After fixing this, the program should work correctly.

**Correctness: False**

If the function `func_1()` is called for each test case, the program would be correct.
