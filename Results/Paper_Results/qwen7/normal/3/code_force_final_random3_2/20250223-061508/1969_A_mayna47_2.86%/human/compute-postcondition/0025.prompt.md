Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 < n ≤ 50, and `p` is a list of n integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ n, `p_i` ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is an integer input split from the input string, and the first element is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
        print(2)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 < n ≤ 50, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 50\), and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. If `v[v[v[2]]]` equals `2`, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function does not change the values of `i` and `n` and `v[v[v[i]]]` remains not equal to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(2 < n \leq 50\), and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`, the function returns None. Since there is no else part, the function does nothing in the case where `v[v[v[i]]]` does not equal `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
