Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `nums[i]` is equal to (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nums[i]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Here, `k.bit_length()` returns the number of bits necessary to represent `k` in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. The expression `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` calculates the largest number that can be represented with `k.bit_length()` bits. Since `n` must be greater than 0, it does not change, and `nums[i]` is updated to the calculated value.
