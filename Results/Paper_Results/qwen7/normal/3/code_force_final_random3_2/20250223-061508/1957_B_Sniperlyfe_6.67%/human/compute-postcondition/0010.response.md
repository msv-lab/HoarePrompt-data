Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` will be 0, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be less than or equal to 0, and `nums` will be a list where each element `nums[i]` is equal to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, until `k` becomes non-positive.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `n` will be 0 because all elements in the list `nums` have been assigned a value and `i` will have reached `n`. The variable `k` will be reduced to a non-positive value since it keeps being decreased by the largest possible value it can hold, which is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. The list `nums` will contain values that are the largest possible values `k` could hold at each step until `k` is no longer positive.
