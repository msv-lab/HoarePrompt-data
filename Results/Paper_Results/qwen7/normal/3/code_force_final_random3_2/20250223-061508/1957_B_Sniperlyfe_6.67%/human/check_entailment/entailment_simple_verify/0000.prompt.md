You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` will be 0, `k` will be 0, and `nums` will be a list where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` for the indices where the loop executed, and 0 otherwise.
    #
    #To understand this, let's break it down:
    #
    #- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
    #- For each iteration, `nums[i]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
    #- Then, `k` is decreased by `nums[i]`.
    #
    #Since `k` starts as some positive value and is decreased by a value that depends on its bit length, eventually `k` will become 0 after enough iterations. When `k` reaches 0, the subtraction operation will no longer change `k`, and since `n` is decremented with each iteration, `n` will also reach 0.
    #
    #Each time through the loop, `nums[i]` is set to a value based on the current bit length of `k`. As `k` decreases, the bit length of `k` decreases, and thus the value of `nums[i]` will be adjusted accordingly. By the end of the loop, `nums` will contain the sequence of values that were assigned to it during the iterations, and `k` will be 0.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` for the indices where the loop executed, and 0 otherwise, and the last element of `nums` is 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence maximizes the number of 1s in its binary representation. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 5`
- Expected Output: A sequence of two numbers that sum to 5 and maximize the number of 1s in their bitwise OR. One valid solution could be `[3, 2]` because `3 | 2 = (11)_2`, which has two 1s.

However, the current implementation sets each element in the sequence to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which means setting each element to the largest possible value with the bit length of `k`. This approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the entire sequence.

For example, with `n=2` and `k=5`, the program generates `[3, 3]` because `(1 << 3.bit_length() - 1) - 1 = 3`. However, the bitwise OR of `[3, 3]` is `3 | 3 = (11)_2`, which also has two 1s, but this is not necessarily the optimal solution. A better solution would be `[3, 2]` as mentioned earlier.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct output and is thus incorrect.
