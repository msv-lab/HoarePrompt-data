Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` for the indices where the loop executed, and 0 otherwise, and `nums[-1]` is added the value of `k` which is 0.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, and `nums` is a list where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` for the indices where the loop executed, and 0 otherwise.
- The line `nums[-1] += k` adds the value of `k` (which is 0) to the last element of `nums`.
- Since `k` is 0, adding 0 to `nums[-1]` does not change the value of `nums[-1]`.
- Therefore, the final state remains the same as the initial state, with `n` and `k` both being 0, and `nums` containing the sequence of values assigned during the loop iterations, plus the last element unchanged by the addition.
