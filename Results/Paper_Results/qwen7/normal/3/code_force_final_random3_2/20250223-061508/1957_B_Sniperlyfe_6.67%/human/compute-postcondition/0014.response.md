Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer within the range [1, 2 * 10^5], and `k` is an integer within the range [1, 10^9]. The function returns a list `nums` where each element is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` for the indices where the loop executed, and 0 otherwise, with the last element of `nums` being 0.**
