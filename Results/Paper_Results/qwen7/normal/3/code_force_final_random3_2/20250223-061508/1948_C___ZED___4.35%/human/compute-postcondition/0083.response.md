Output State: **`no_path` is `True`, `k` is equal to `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-1` if `n` is odd.**

Explanation: The code sets `no_path` to `True`. This changes the value of `no_path` from `False` to `True`. The value of `k` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not affect `k`. Therefore, `k` is still equal to `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-1` if `n` is odd.
