Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `no_path` is `True`.
2. `k` is set to `n-1`, where `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
3. The value of `a[n-1]` remains unchanged, but this variable is not used in the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
