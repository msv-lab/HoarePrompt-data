Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for k in range(0, n, 2)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `k` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `k` is within the range defined by `range(0, n, 2)`. This means `k` starts from 0 and increments by 2 until it reaches a value that is no longer less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is a list of characters.
   - `no_path` remains `False`.
   - The element at index `k` in list `b` is not `'>'`, so `no_path` remains unchanged as `False`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `k` is incremented by 2 each time, the next value of `k` would be `k + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `k + 2` must still be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `k` needs to be updated to `k + 2`.
   - `no_path` remains `False` because the condition for changing its value (element at index `k` being `'>'`) was not met in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`b` is a list of characters, `no_path` remains `False`, and `k` is `k + 2`**.
