Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `k` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `1 <= k < n - 1` and `k` increments by 2 each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `no_path` is `False`
   - `k` is `3`
   - `n` is an integer such that `1 < n - 1` (which means `n > 2`)
   - The current value of `a[k]` is not `'>'`

4. **Next iteration requirements**:
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must be incremented by 2 from its current value.
   - Therefore, `k` will become `3 + 2 = 5`.
   - The condition `1 <= k < n - 1` must still hold true.
   - Since `n > 2`, `n - 1` is greater than 2, and `5 < n - 1` will be true as long as `n > 6`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `k` will be updated to `5`.
   - `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition does not depend on `n` changing; it only depends on `k` and the range defined by `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `no_path` is `False`, `k` is `5`, `n` is an integer such that `1 < n - 1`, and the current value of `a[k]` is not `'>'`.**
