Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for k in range(1, n - 1, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `k` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - The postcondition is that if `a[3]` is not '>', then `no_path` remains False.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `k`**:
   - The loop increments `k` by 2 each time (since the step size is 2).
   - Starting from `k = 3`, the next value of `k` would be `3 + 2 = 5`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `1 <= k < n - 1`.
   - Since `k` is now 5, we need to check if `5 < n - 1` or equivalently `n > 6`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `k` will be updated to 5.
   - `n` must still be greater than 6 for the loop to continue.

6. **Postcondition Adjustment**:
   - The postcondition needs to be adjusted based on the new value of `k`.
   - The postcondition remains the same as long as `k` does not exceed `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`k` is 5, `n` must be greater than 6, and if `a[5]` is not '>', then `no_path` remains False**.
