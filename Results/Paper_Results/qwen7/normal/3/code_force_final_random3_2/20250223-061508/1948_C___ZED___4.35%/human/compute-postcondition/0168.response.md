Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two strings of equal even length consisting only of '<' and '>'. For each test case, it checks if the second-to-last character of the second string is '>', and if the length of the string is 2 or more. If these conditions are met, it further checks if the characters at specific positions in the strings meet certain criteria. Based on these checks, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.**
