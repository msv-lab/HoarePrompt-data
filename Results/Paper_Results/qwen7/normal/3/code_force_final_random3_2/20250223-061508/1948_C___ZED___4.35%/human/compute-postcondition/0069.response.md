Output State: **`b` is a list of characters; no_path is False.**

Explanation: The variable `no_path` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the list `b`. Therefore, the list `b` remains unchanged, and its current value of `b[k]` (which is not equal to '>') is still valid. The only new information is that `no_path` is now `False`.
