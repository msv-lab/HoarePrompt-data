Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, n)`. This means the loop starts from `i = 1` and continues as long as `i < n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`.
   - `i` is currently 1.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 (assuming `n > 2`).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < n`, so `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `max_beauty` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**.
