Output State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `max_beauty` by adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`. Since `i` is initially 1, the code calculates `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])` and adds this value to `max_beauty`. The initial value of `i` is 1, and the condition that `n` must be at least 1 remains unchanged.
