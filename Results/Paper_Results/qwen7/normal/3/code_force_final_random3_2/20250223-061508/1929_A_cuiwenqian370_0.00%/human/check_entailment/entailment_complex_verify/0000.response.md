### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum beauty of the array \(a\) defined as the sum of values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, we need to strategically arrange the elements of the array.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The function `func_1` starts by sorting the array `arr`. Sorting helps in arranging the elements in a way that might help in maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Constructing the New Array (`new_arr`)**:
   - The function then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements. This is done using two pointers, `left` starting from the beginning and `right` starting from the end of the sorted array.
   - If `left` equals `right`, only one element is appended; otherwise, the largest and smallest elements are alternately appended.

3. **Calculating Maximum Beauty**:
   - After constructing `new_arr`, the function calculates the maximum beauty by summing the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **Initial State**: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies \(1 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^9\).
- **After Sorting**: The array `arr` is sorted, and the pointers `left` and `right` are initialized.
- **Building `new_arr`**: The function alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements, ensuring that the differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` are maximized.
- **Calculating `max_beauty`**: The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The original assessment claims that the program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty because it alternates between the smallest and largest elements, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty.
- However, upon closer inspection, the approach of alternating between the smallest and largest elements ensures that the differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` are indeed maximized. This is because the largest and smallest elements will always contribute the maximum possible difference when placed consecutively.

#### Example Verification:
Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
3
4
10 5 15 20
```
- Sorting the array gives `[5, 10, 15, 20]`.
- Constructing `new_arr` by alternating gives `[5, 20, 10, 15]`.
- Calculating the beauty:
  \[
  |20 - 5| + |10 - 20| + |15 - 10| = 15 + 10 + 5 = 30
  \]
This matches the expected output.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect because the approach of alternating between the smallest and largest elements in the sorted array does indeed maximize the beauty of the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
