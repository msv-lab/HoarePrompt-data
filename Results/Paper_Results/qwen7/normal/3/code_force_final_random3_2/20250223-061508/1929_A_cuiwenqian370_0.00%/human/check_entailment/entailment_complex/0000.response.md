Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Sorting and Rearrangement**:
   - The array is sorted, which ensures that the smallest values are at the start and the largest values are at the end.
   - The `func_1` function constructs a new array (`new_arr`) by alternating elements from the end and beginning of the sorted array. This ensures that the difference between consecutive elements in `new_arr` is maximized.
3. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr`.
   - Since the array is constructed by alternating the smallest and largest remaining elements, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
