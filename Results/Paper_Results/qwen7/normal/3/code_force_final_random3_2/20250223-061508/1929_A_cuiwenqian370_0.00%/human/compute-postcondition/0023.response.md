Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `left <= right`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `left` is 2.
   - `right` is `right - 1` (meaning `right` has been decremented by 1 from its previous value).
   - `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[0]` and at least one of `arr[1]` or `arr[right]`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue executing, the condition `left <= right` must still hold true.
   - Given that `left` is currently 2, `right` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `right` was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration, the new value of `right` is `right - 1`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `right - 1` must be at least 2, meaning `right` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `right` is at least 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`left` is 2, `right` must be at least 3, and `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[0]` and at least one of `arr[1]` or `arr[right]`**.
