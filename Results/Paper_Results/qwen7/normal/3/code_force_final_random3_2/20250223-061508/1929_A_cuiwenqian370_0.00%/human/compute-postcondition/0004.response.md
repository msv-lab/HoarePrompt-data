Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `left <= right`.
2. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `left` is 0.
   - `right` is `n - 1`.
   - `new_arr` is an empty list.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `left <= right` must be true.
   - Given `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`, the condition `0 <= n - 1` must hold true.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `left` is already 0, we need to ensure that `right` is at least 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
   - Therefore, `right` must be greater than or equal to 0.

5. **Final state**:
   - `left` remains 0.
   - `right` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `new_arr` being an empty list does not affect the loop condition and does not need adjustment.

So, the final state right before the loop that ensures the loop can execute the first time is:

State: **`left` is 0, `right` must be greater than or equal to 0, `new_arr` is an empty list**
