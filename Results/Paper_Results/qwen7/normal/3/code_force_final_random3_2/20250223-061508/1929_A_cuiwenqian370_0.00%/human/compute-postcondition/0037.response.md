Output State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[2]` and `new_arr[1]`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**.

Explanation: The code updates `max_beauty` by adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` (which is `new_arr[2]` since `i` is 2) and `new_arr[i - 1]` (which is `new_arr[1]`). The value of `i` is incremented to 3, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
