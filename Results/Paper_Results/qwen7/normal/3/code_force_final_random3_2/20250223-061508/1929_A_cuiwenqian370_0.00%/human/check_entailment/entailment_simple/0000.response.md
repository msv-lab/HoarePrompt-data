Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array elements (`arr`).
3. The `func_1` function is responsible for rearranging the array to maximize the beauty.
4. In `func_1`, the array is sorted, and then elements are added to `new_arr` in an alternating fashion starting from the smallest and largest elements, ensuring the maximum difference between consecutive elements.
5. The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr`.
6. The logic in `func_1` ensures that the maximum possible beauty is achieved by placing the smallest and largest elements next to each other as much as possible.
7. The program outputs the result for each test case as expected.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the `func_1` function is correct and achieves the goal of maximizing the beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
