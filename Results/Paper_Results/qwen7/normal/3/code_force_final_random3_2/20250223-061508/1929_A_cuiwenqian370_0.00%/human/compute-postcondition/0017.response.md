Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` is greater than or equal to 1, `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[0]` and `arr[right]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `arr[right]` to `new_arr`. Initially, `new_arr` contains either `arr[0]` (if `left` equals `right`) or `arr[0]` and `arr[right]`. Since `left` is 1, appending `arr[right]` means `new_arr` now contains both `arr[0]` and `arr[right]`. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged, and the condition that `right` must be greater than or equal to 1 still holds.
