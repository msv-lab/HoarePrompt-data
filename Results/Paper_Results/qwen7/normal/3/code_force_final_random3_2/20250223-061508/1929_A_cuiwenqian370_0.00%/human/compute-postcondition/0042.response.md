Output State: **`The program returns max_beauty which is the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in new_arr from index 1 to n-1`**

This means that after the loop has executed, `max_beauty` holds the total beauty calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between every adjacent pair of elements in the `new_arr` list, starting from `new_arr[1]` up to `new_arr[n-1]`. The value of `max_beauty` is the final result of these calculations.
