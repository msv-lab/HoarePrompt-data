Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[2]` and `new_arr[1]`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 3 (because `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 4.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `max_beauty` remains unchanged as it was not part of the loop head.
- `i` becomes 4.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[2]` and `new_arr[1]`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3**
