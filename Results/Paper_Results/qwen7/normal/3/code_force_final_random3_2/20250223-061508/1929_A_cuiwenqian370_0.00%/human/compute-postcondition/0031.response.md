Output State: `left` is `n - 1`, `right` is 0, and `new_arr` is a list containing every second element from `arr` starting from `arr[0]` and going up to `arr[n-1]` if `n` is odd, or up to `arr[n-2]` if `n` is even.

To explain this in simple terms:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `left` pointer will be at the position `n - 1`, and the `right` pointer will be at the position 0. The `new_arr` list will contain every second element from the original array `arr`, starting from the first element (`arr[0]`) and appending elements in the order they were added during each iteration of the loop. If the length of the array `n` is odd, `new_arr` will end with the last element of `arr`. If `n` is even, `new_arr` will end just before the last element of `arr`.
