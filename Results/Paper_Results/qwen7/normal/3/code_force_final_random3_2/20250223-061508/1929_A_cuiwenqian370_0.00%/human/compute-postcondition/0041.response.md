Output State: `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `max_beauty` will hold the total beauty calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between every adjacent pair of elements in the `new_arr` list, starting from `new_arr[1]` up to `new_arr[n-1]`. The value of `i` will be `n`, and the loop will have iterated `n-1` times, covering all possible pairs of consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
