Output State: **`left` is `n - 1`, `right` is 0, and `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` in a specific order. `max_beauty` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `max_beauty` to 0. This does not affect the values of `left`, `right`, or `new_arr`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as in the initial state. `left` is `n - 1`, `right` is 0, and `new_arr` contains all elements from the original array `arr`, ordered as specified. `max_beauty` remains unchanged and is set to 0.
