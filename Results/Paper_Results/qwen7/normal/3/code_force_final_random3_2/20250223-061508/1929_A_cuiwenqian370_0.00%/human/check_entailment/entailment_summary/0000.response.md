Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The provided solution works as follows:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order.
2. **Constructing the New Array**: A new array `new_arr` is constructed by alternately taking elements from the start and end of the sorted array. This ensures that the largest and smallest values are placed farthest apart, maximizing the difference between consecutive elements.
3. **Calculating Maximum Beauty**: The maximum beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr`.

Let's verify this step-by-step against the examples provided in the problem statement:

- **Example 1**: 
  - Input: `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - New array: `[3, 1, 2]` (constructed by alternating from end to start)
  - Beauty: `(3 - 1) + (1 - 2) = 2 + (-1) = 1` (but the correct answer is 2, indicating a potential issue with the logic)

- **Example 2**: 
  - Input: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - New array: `[69, 69, 69]` (alternating from end to start)
  - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`

- **Example 3**: 
  - Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - New array: `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]` (alternating from end to start)
  - Beauty: `(100 - 43) + (43 - 90) + (90 - 54) + (54 - 80) = 57`

- **Example 4**: 
  - Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - New array: `[4, 3, 3, 3]` (alternating from end to start)
  - Beauty: `(4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1`

- **Example 5**: 
  - Input: `[2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
  - New array: `[2, 1]` (alternating from end to start)
  - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`

Upon closer inspection, the construction of `new_arr` should ensure that the largest and smallest elements are placed at opposite ends to maximize the differences. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the alternating placement, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly alternate elements from the sorted array to achieve the maximum beauty. The logic needs to be adjusted to properly alternate elements from the sorted array to maximize the differences.
