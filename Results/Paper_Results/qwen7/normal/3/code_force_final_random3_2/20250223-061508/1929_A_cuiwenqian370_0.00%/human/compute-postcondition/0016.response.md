Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` must be greater than or equal to 1, `new_arr` is a list containing `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `arr[left]` to `new_arr`. Given the initial state where `left` is 1, `new_arr` initially contains `arr[0]` and `arr[right]` (with `right` being greater than or equal to 1), after appending `arr[left]` (which is `arr[1]`), `new_arr` now contains `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged, and the condition that `right` must be greater than or equal to 1 still holds.
