Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `j` is `n-1`, and the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1.**

This means that `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among the three options given. The values of `j` and the condition about the count of `j + 1` in `cards` remain unchanged.
