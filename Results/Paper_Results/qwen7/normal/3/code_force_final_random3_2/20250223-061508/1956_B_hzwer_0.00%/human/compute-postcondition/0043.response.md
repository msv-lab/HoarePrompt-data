Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, `j` is `n-1`, and the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is not equal to 0, and the current count of `j + 1` in `cards` is exactly 1.**

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated based on the given formula, while the other conditions and values remain unchanged.
