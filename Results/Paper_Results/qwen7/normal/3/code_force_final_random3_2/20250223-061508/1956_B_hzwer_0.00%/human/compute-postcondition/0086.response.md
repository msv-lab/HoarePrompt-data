Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 2`, `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`**.

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to the maximum of three possible values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
