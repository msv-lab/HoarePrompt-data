Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`. If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is exactly 1, then `dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is more than 1, then `dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**
