Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1); `dp[n - 1][0]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sets the value of `dp[n - 1][0]` to 0. The dimensions of the `dp` list remain unchanged, and all other elements of `dp` are still zeros. The values of `t` and `n` and the list `cards` are not affected by this code snippet.
