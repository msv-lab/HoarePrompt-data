Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 2`, and `dp[i][j]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`.**

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`, while the values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
