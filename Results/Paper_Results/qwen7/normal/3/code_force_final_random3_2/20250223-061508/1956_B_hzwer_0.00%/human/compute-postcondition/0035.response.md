Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the condition `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `j` will take values from `n-1` down to `0`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j` equal to `n-1`, we need to set `j` to `n-1` at the beginning of the loop.

3. **Consider the state of other variables**: The problem states that `dp` is updated according to the conditions provided for `i = 0` and `i` is 0. However, these variables (`dp` and `i`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

4. **State the necessary adjustments**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `j`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` being set to `n-1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is `n-1`**
