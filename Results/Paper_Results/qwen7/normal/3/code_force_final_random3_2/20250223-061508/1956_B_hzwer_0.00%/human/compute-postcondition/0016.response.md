Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` if `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` remains `dp[i + 1][j]`.**
