Postcondition: **`dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` if `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is `n - 3`.**
