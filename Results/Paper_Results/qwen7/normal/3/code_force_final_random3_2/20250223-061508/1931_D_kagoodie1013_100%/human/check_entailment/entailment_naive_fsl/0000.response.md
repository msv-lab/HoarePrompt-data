Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. It iterates through the array, calculates the residues for each element with respect to `x` and `y`, and uses a dictionary to keep track of the counts of these residues. This approach ensures that all pairs `(i, j)` where `1 <= i < j <= n` are considered and checked against the conditions specified in the problem description. The program handles all potential cases as described, and no edge cases or specific inputs were found that would make the program incorrect.
