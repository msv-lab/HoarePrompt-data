Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code increments the `count` variable by the value returned by `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`. This means `count` is updated based on the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in the `residue_map` dictionary, or 0 if the key does not exist. The values of `r_x` and `r_y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
