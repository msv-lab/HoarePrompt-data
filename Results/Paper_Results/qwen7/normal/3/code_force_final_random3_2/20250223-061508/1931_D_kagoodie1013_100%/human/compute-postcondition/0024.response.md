The code appends the value of `count` to the list `results`. Since `count` is the sum of all values in `residue_map.values()`, `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated based on the last `num` processed, and `current_key` corresponds to the last `num`, these values remain unchanged. The `residue_map` contains counts of all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs encountered during the loop execution.

After appending `count` to `results`, the output state is:
Output State: **`results` contains the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of all values in `residue_map.values()`, `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated based on the last `num` processed, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)` corresponding to the last `num`, and `residue_map` contains counts of all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs encountered during the loop execution.**
