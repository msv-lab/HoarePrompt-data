Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for num in arr:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num` is a variable that will take on values from the list `arr`.
   - `arr` is a list that is not explicitly defined in the given state.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`.
   - For each iteration, `num` will take the value of the current element in `arr`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `num` will take on values from `arr`, `arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `num` will be the first element of `arr` in the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).
- `results` is an empty list.
- `count` is 0.

Since the loop involves `arr` and `num`, we need to ensure that `arr` is non-empty for the loop to execute. The other variables (`residue_map`, `test_cases`, `results`, and `count`) do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `arr` must contain at least one element.

**Final State:**
State: **`residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), results is an empty list, count is 0, `arr` must contain at least one element**
