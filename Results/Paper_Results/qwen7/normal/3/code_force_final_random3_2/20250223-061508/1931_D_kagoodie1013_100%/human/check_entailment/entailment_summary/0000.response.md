Reasoning:
1. The program reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the necessary values (n, x, y, and the array).
3. The core logic of the program is implemented in the `func_1` function, which iterates through each element of the array and uses a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the counts of unique pairs (r_x, r_y).
4. The calculation of r_x and r_y is done correctly:
   - \( r_x = -num \% x \) effectively computes the remainder when \(-num\) is divided by \(x\).
   - \( r_y = num \% y \) computes the remainder when \(num\) is divided by \(y\).
5. The count of beautiful pairs is calculated by checking how many times each unique pair (r_x, r_y) has occurred before the current element.
6. The program outputs the results for each test case as required.

Given the execution summary and the analysis above, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
