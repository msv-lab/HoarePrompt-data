Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the final state includes `count` being the sum of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each iteration, `r_x` being the last calculated value of `-num % x`, `r_y` being the last calculated value of `num % y`, `current_key` being the last calculated key `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` being a dictionary where each key `(r_x, r_y)` is mapped to its count of occurrences in the loop, `num` being the last element processed in `arr`, `x` being the last value of `x` from `test_cases`, `y` being the last value of `y` from `test_cases`, and `arr` being the list of numbers processed in the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `count` will hold the total sum of counts for each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` encountered during the loop's execution. The `residue_map` dictionary will contain all unique pairs `(r_x, r_y)` as keys and their respective counts as values. The variables `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` will reflect the last computed values based on the last element processed in `arr`.
