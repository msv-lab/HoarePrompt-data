Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `results` contains the value of `count`.
   - `count` is the sum of all values in `residue_map.values()`.
   - `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated based on the last `num` processed.
   - `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)` corresponding to the last `num`.
   - `residue_map` contains counts of all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs encountered during the loop execution.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `test_cases`, where each element is a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `test_cases`, the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will change to the next tuple in `test_cases`.
   - The other variables (`results`, `count`, `r_x`, `r_y`, `current_key`, and `residue_map`) are not directly affected by the loop itself but rather by the processing inside the loop body. However, for the loop to continue, the next tuple must be available.

Given this information, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`results` contains the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of all values in `residue_map.values()`, `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated based on the last `num` processed, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)` corresponding to the last `num`, `residue_map` contains counts of all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs encountered during the loop execution, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`**.
