Output State: **The final value of `count` will be the sum of all values in `residue_map`'s values plus the sum of `residue_map.get((num % x, num % y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`. `results` will contain this final value of `count`. `r_x` and `r_y` will be the last calculated values of `-num % x` and `num % y` respectively. `current_key` will be the last calculated key `(num % x, num % y)`. `residue_map` will be a dictionary containing all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs from `arr` as keys and their respective counts as values. `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will be empty or irrelevant to the final state since the loop has completed.**

This means that after all iterations, `count` accumulates the total occurrences of each unique pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` across all numbers in `arr`. The `residue_map` captures how many times each residue pair appears. The `current_key` reflects the last residue pair seen in the array.
