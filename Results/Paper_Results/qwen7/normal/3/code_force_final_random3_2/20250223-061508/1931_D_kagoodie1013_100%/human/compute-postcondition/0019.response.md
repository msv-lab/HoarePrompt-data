Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`, `r_y` is updated to `num % y`**

Explanation: The code increments `count` by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`. The values of `r_x`, `r_y`, `current_key`, `residue_map[current_key]`, `num`, `r_x`, and `r_y` remain unchanged from their previous states. The `count` variable is updated based on the current values of `r_x` and `r_y`.
