State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), results is an empty list, (n, x, y, arr) must be a valid tuple from test_cases**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers `(n, x, y)` followed by a list of `n` integers `(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)`.
2. For the loop to execute, there must be at least one tuple in `test_cases` that matches the structure `(n, x, y, arr)`.
3. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are derived from this tuple in each iteration.
4. Since `results` is initially an empty list, its state does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are related to the structure and content of `test_cases` to ensure that the loop can iterate over valid tuples.
