Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `num` from the list `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `arr`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`.
   - `r_x` is `-num % x`.
   - `r_y` is `num % y`.
   - `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`.
   - `residue_map[current_key]` is `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`.
   - `num` is the next element in `arr`.
   - `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`.
   - `r_y` is updated to `num % y`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the next element in `arr`, it will be the starting point for the next iteration.
   - `r_x` and `r_y` are updated based on the new `num`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `num` will be the next element in `arr`.
   - `r_x` will be `-num % x`.
   - `r_y` will be `num % y`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`, `r_y` is updated to `num % y`**.

However, since we need to provide the state just before the loop starts (i.e., right after the current iteration ends but before the next one begins), we focus on the updated values of `num`, `r_x`, and `r_y`.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`, `r_y` is updated to `num % y`**.

To summarize the key adjustments:
- `num` becomes the next element in `arr`.
- `r_x` becomes `-num % x`.
- `r_y` becomes `num % y`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`, `r_y` is updated to `num % y`**.
