Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `test_cases` to process.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `n`: This is the first element of the tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `x`: This is the second element of the tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `y`: This is the third element of the tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `arr`: This is the fourth element of the tuple in `test_cases`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `results`: This variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `count`: This variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `r_x` and `r_y`: These variables are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.
   - `current_key`: This variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `residue_map`: This dictionary is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since the loop is about to start processing the next tuple from `test_cases`, the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will change to the next tuple in `test_cases`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `results` contains the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of all values in `residue_map.values()`, `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated based on the last `num` processed, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)` corresponding to the last `num`, and `residue_map` contains counts of all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs encountered during the loop execution, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

In a simplified format:

**State: `results` contains the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of all values in `residue_map.values()`, `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated based on the last `num` processed, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)` corresponding to the last `num`, and `residue_map` contains counts of all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs encountered during the loop execution, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
