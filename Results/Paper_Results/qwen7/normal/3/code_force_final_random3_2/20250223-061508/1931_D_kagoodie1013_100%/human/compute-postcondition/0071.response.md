Output State: The loop has executed for all elements in `arr`. Therefore, `count` will be the sum of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each iteration. `r_x` and `r_y` will be the last calculated values from the loop, specifically `-num % x` and `num % y` respectively, where `num` is the last element processed in `arr`. `current_key` will be the last calculated key, which is `(num % x, num % y)`. `residue_map` will contain all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs as keys, with their respective counts as values. `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will be the last values from the final tuple in `test_cases`.

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, `count` will hold the total sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` found in `arr` according to the given conditions. `r_x` and `r_y` will reflect the last computed values from the loop. `current_key` will represent the last key computed. `residue_map` will be a dictionary containing all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs encountered during the loop, along with their frequencies. The values of `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will be those from the last tuple in `test_cases`.
