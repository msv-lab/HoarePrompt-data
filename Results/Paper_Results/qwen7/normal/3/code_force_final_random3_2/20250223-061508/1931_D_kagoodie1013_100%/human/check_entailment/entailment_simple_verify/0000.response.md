### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts.
   - It then processes each test case by extracting `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It creates a dictionary `residue_map` to store the frequency of each unique pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)`.
   - It iterates through each element `num` in the array `arr`:
     - Computes `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
     - Uses `residue_map` to find the count of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` already seen and adds this count to `count`.
     - Updates the frequency of the current pair `(num % x, num % y)` in `residue_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements in the array for each test case, the program appends the final count to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Key Points to Validate:

- **Residue Calculation:**
  - The calculation `r_x = -num % x` is equivalent to `(x - (num % x)) % x`. This ensures that `r_x` is always non-negative and less than `x`.
  - The calculation `r_y = num % y` directly gives the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.

- **Pair Counting:**
  - The program correctly uses the `residue_map` to count the number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` that satisfy the conditions.
  - The count is incremented by the frequency of the pair `(r_x, r_y)` already present in `residue_map`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles all elements in the array and correctly updates the `residue_map` and `count`.
  - The use of `-num % x` ensures that the residue is correctly calculated even when `num % x` is zero.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. No edge cases or specific inputs were found that would make the program incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array.
