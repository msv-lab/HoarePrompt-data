Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), results is an empty list, count is 0, (n, x, y, arr) must be a valid tuple from test_cases.**

The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. This does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `results`, or the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. Therefore, these values remain unchanged.
