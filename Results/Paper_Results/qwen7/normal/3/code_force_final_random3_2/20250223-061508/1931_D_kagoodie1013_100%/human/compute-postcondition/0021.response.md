Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`, `r_y` is updated to `num % y`, `residue_map[current_key]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1` increments the count of the current key in the `residue_map` dictionary. The current key is `(num % x, num % y)`. This operation does not affect any other variables, so their states remain unchanged. The only change is that the count of the current key in the `residue_map` dictionary is incremented by 1.
