### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary to validate the original assessment.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).
- For each array `arr` in `test_cases`, it calculates the residues for each element with respect to `x` and `y`.
- It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the counts of these residues.
- The count of beautiful pairs is determined by checking how many times each unique pair of residues (r_x, r_y) appears in the array.
- Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs for each array to the `results` list and returns this list.

#### Program Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the test cases and their corresponding arrays.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues.
   - It iterates through each element in the array `arr`, calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`, and updates the count based on the values in `residue_map`.
   - It also updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results for each test case.

#### Correctness Validation:
- The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs based on the given conditions.
- It handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
- The use of residues (`r_x` and `r_y`) ensures that all pairs `(i, j)` where `1 <= i < j <= n` are considered and checked against the conditions specified in the problem description.
- No edge cases or specific inputs were found that would make the program incorrect.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
