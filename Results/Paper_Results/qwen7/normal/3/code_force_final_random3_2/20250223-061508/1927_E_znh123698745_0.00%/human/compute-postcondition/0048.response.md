Output State: **`i` is \(n-1\), `a` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1, `array` is a predefined list, `answer` is a list with the last element of the updated `a` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decreases the last element of the list `a` by 1. Since `i` is initially \(n-1\), it remains unchanged. The `array` and `answer` remain unaffected by this operation. The `answer` list is updated to include the new last element of `a`.
