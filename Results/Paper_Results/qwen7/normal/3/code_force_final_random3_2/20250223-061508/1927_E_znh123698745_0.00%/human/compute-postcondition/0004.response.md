Output State: **`a` is [1, -1], `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to int, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integer 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with the values `[1, -1]`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `array`, or `answer`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
