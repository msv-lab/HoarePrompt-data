Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `array[a[0]]` is appended to `answer`**

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the value of `a[0]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `n` must still be greater than 1, `a[0]` has been increased by 1, and `array[a[0]]` is still appended to `answer`.
