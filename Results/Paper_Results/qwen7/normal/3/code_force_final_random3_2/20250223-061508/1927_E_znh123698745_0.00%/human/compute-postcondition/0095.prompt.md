Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    array = list(range(1, n + 1))
    answer = [1]
    a = [1, -1]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if (-1) ** i == -1:
            answer.append(array[a[-1]])
            a[-1] -= 1
        else:
            answer.append(array[a[0]])
            a[0] += 1
    print(*answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop will execute `n-1` times in total. After all iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`. The variable `answer` will contain elements from the `array` based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, if `(-1)**i` is -1, the element at `array[a[-1]]` will be appended to `answer` and `a[-1]` will be decreased by 1. Otherwise, the element at `array[a[0]]` will be appended to `answer` and `a[0]` will be increased by 1. The final state of `a` will depend on how many times each condition was met during the loop iterations. Since the loop runs `n-1` times, `a[0]` and `a[-1]` will be adjusted accordingly, but their exact final values cannot be determined without knowing the exact sequence of `(-1)**i` evaluations. The `answer` list will contain `n` elements, starting with 1 and following the pattern described by the loop conditions.

To summarize, the final `answer` list will contain `n` elements, and the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]` will reflect the adjustments made during the loop iterations, while `i` will be `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final state of the loop will have `i` equal to `n`, `a` as a list with two elements where `a[0]` is `n` and `a[-1]` is 1, `array` remains unchanged, and `answer` is a list containing `n` elements. The elements in `answer` alternate between the last remaining element of `array` (as `a[-1]` decreases) and the first element of `array` (as `a[0]` increases).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The final state of the loop will be such that `i` equals `n`, `answer` is a list that contains elements from the `array` based on the conditions inside the loop, and both `a[0]` and `a[-1]` will have been adjusted according to the loop's operations.

To elaborate, after all iterations of the loop:
- `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
- `answer` will contain elements from `array` as follows:
  - If `i` was odd during any iteration, `array[a[-1]]` was appended to `answer` and `a[-1]` was decremented by 1.
  - If `i` was even during any iteration, `array[a[0]]` was appended to `answer` and `a[0]` was incremented by 1.
- Both `a[0]` and `a[-1]` will be adjusted such that `a[-1]` will be `1` (since it starts at `n+1` and gets decremented until it reaches `1`) and `a[0]` will be `n` (since it starts at `1` and gets incremented until it reaches `n`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
