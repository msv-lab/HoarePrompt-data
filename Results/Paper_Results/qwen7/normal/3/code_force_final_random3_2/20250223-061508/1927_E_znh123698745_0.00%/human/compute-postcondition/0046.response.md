Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the state changes inside the loop**:
   - If \((-1)^i = -1\), then `answer` gets an additional element which is `array[a[-1] - 1]`.
   - If \((-1)^i = 1\), then `a[0]` is incremented by 1, and `answer` gets an additional element from `array[a[0]]`.

4. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `a` is a list.
   - `array` is a predefined list.
   - `answer` is a list.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be `n-2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented to `n-1` in the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `n-1`.
   - `n` remains the same.

7. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now `n-1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `a`, `array`, and `answer` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is \(n-1\), `a` is a list, `array` is a predefined list, and `answer` is a list.**
