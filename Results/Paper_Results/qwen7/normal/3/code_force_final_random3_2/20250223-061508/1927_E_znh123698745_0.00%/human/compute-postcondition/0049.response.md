Output State: **`i` is \(n-1\), `a` is a list, `array` is a predefined list, `answer` is a list with the first element being `array[a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element from the `array` list at the index specified by the first element of the list `a` to the `answer` list. The values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged, while `answer` now includes the appended element.
