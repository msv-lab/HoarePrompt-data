Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is either \(n\) or \(n-1\).
   - `a` is a list.
   - `array` is a predefined list.
   - `answer` is a list.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n)`, meaning `i` will take values from 1 to \(n-1\).

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - If `i` is \(n-1\), the last element of `a` is decreased by 1, and the last element of the updated `a` is appended to `answer`.
   - If `i` is \(n\), the first element of `a` is increased by 1, and `answer` contains the first element of `array` at index `a[0]`.

4. **Current State:**
   - Since the loop condition is `range(1, n)`, `i` must be between 1 and \(n-1\) (inclusive).

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if `i` was \(n-1\), it will become \(n\).
   - If `i` was \(n\), it will become \(n+1\), but since the loop condition is `range(1, n)`, this case is not possible.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - If `i` was \(n-1\), it will now be \(n\).
   - The first element of `a` will be increased by 1.
   - `answer` will contain the first element of `array` at index `a[0]`.

Given these steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` will change from \(n-1\) to \(n\).
- The first element of `a` will be increased by 1.
- `answer` will contain the first element of `array` at index `a[0]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is \(n\), `a` is a list where the first element is increased by 1, `array` is a predefined list, and `answer` contains the first element of `array` at index `a[0]`.**
