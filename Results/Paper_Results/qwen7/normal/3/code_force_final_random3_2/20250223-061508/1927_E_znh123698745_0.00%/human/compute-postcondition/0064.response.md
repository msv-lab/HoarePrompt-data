Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list with two elements where `a[0]` is `n + 2` and `a[-1]` is -1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to n inclusive.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list called `array` using the `range` function, which generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This does not affect the values of `i`, `a`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
