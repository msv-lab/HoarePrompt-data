Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `(-1) ** i` is -1, `array[a[-1]]` is appended to `answer`.**

The code appends the element `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`. However, the specific values of `array` and `a` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value that was appended. The precondition remains unchanged except for the fact that `array[a[-1]]` has been added to `answer`.
