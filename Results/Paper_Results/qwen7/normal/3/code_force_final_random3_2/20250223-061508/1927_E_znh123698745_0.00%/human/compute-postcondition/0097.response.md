Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(n\) and \(k\), where \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(k\) is even. For each test case, it constructs a list `answer` containing \(n\) elements. Starting with 1, the list follows a specific alternating pattern based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`. After processing all test cases, the function prints the `answer` list for each case.**
