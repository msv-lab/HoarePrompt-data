Output State: **`x` is equal to `y`, `y` is equal to `a`, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or any other number). Since the initial state does not specify the value of `ans`, we assume it was 0 before the increment. After executing `ans += 1`, `ans` becomes 1. The values of `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged.
