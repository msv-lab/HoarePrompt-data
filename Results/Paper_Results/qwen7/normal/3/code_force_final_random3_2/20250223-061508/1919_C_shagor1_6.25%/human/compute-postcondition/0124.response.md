Output State: **`x` is equal to `y`, `a` is the third element in `inp`, `y` is the third element in `inp`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a` to `y`. Since `a` is the third element in `inp`, `y` now holds the same value. The values of `x` and `ans` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
