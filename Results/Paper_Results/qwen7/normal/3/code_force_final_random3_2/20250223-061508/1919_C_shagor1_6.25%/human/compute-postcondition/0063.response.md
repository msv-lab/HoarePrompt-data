Postcondition: `inp` is a list of integers with at least one element, and there is no integer `a` in `inp` such that `a` is less than or equal to `x`. If `a` (which is equal to `y`) is less than or equal to `y`, then `x` remains unchanged and `y` is equal to `a`, and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `y` is greater than or equal to some element in `inp`, and `x` remains unchanged.
