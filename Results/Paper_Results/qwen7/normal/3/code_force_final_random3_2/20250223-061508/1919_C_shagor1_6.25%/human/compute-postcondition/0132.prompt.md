Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    *inp, = map(int, input().split())
    x = y = n + 1
    ans = 0
    for a in inp:
        if a <= x:
            x = a
        elif a <= y:
            y = a
        else:
            x == y
            y = a
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is the minimum value in the list `inp`, `y` is the second smallest value in the list `inp`, `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than `y`, and `inp` is the same list as before.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `ans` will be the count of unique minimum elements encountered in `inp`, `x` will be the overall minimum element in `inp`, and `y` will be the last unique minimum element encountered in `inp` if there are multiple minimum elements, otherwise `y` will be the same as `x` if there is only one minimum element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `x` will be the minimum value in `inp`, `y` will be the second minimum value in `inp` if there are at least two distinct elements in `inp`, and `ans` will be the count of unique minimum values in `inp` if all elements are the same, otherwise it will be the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
