Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is equal to `a`, `y` is either `n + 1` or `a` depending on whether `a <= x` or `a > x`, `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a <= y` holds true, and `inp` must have at least one element remaining.**

Explanation: The code `x = a` assigns the value of `a` to the variable `x`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `y`, `ans`, and `inp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
