Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with the key `i` and value `1`, `i` is the next element in the list `palka`.**

The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, but it is now associated with the value `1` in the dictionary `d`. The initial state of `i` being the next element in the list `palka` is still valid.
