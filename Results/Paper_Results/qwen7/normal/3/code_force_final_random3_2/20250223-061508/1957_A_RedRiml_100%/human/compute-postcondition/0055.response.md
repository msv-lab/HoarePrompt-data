Output State: **`d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is an empty list, `w` is decremented by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary `d`. This operation does not affect the values of `pl`, `w`, `ln`, or `palka`. Therefore, the only change is that `d` is now an empty dictionary. The other variables retain their previous states.
