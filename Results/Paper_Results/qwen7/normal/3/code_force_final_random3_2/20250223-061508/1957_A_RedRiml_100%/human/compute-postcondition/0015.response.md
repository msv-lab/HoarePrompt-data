Output State: **`d` is a dictionary. `i` is a key in the dictionary and its value is set to 1. `i` is now in the list `pl`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the key `i` from the dictionary `d` into the list `pl`. Since `i` was already a key in the dictionary and its value was set to 1, and it was not previously in the list `pl`, after executing the code, `i` is now added to the list `pl`.
