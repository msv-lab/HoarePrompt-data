Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `d` will be a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appeared in `palka`. The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.**

This means that for every integer `i` in `palka`, `d[i]` will reflect the total occurrences of `i` in `palka`, and `pl` will be a list of all distinct integers from `palka`, maintaining their order of first appearance.
