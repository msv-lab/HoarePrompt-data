Output State: **`i` is the second element of `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the second element of `palka` appended once, and `d` is a dictionary where the value of the second element of `palka` is incremented by 1 if it was initially `None`, or set to 1 if it was not `None`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is the second element of `palka`) to the list `pl`. This does not affect the values of `i` or the dictionary `d`. Therefore, `i` remains as the second element of `palka`, `pl` now contains the second element of `palka` appended once, and `d` remains unchanged according to its initial condition.
