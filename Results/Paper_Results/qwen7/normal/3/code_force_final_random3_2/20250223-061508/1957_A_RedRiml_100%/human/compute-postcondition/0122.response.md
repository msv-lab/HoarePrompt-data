Output State: **`i` is the second element of `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the second element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where the value of the second element of `palka` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` in dictionary `d` to 1. Since `i` is the second element of `palka`, and `pl` is a list containing the second element of `palka`, these variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` is updated such that its value corresponding to the key `i` (which is the second element of `palka`) is now 1.
