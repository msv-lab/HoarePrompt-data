Output State: **`pl` is a list of unique elements, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3` where `j` is the next element in `pl`.**

Explanation: The code `shapes += d[j] // 3` increases the value of `shapes` by `d[j] // 3`, where `j` is the next element in the list `pl`. The list `pl` remains unchanged, and the updated value of `shapes` is the original value plus `d[j] // 3`.
