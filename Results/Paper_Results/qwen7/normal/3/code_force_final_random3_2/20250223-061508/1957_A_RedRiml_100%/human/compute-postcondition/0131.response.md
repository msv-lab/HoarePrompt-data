Output State: **`d[i]` is incremented by 1, `i` is the third element of `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the third element of `palka` appended once, and `d` is a dictionary where the value of the third element of `palka` is incremented by 1 if it was initially `None`, or set to 1 if it was not `None`.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Since `i` is the third element of `palka`, `d[i]` refers to the value in the dictionary `d` corresponding to the key `i`. The other variables (`pl` and `d` with respect to its structure) remain unchanged from their initial state.
