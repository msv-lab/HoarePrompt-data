Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of sticks.
   - It then reads a list of stick lengths into the list `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - Another list `pl` is initialized to store unique stick lengths.
   - The program iterates over each stick length in `palka`, updates the count in `d`, and adds the length to `pl` if it hasn't been added before.

3. **Calculating Maximum Number of Polygons:**
   - The variable `shapes` is initialized to zero.
   - The program then iterates over each unique stick length in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length, it checks if the count in `d` is at least 3. If so, it adds the count divided by 3 to `shapes`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the value of `shapes` for each test case.
