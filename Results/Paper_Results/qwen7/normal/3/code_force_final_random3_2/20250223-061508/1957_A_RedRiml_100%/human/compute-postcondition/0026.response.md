Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `palka`. For each iteration, if the key `i` does not exist in the dictionary `d`, it is added with a value of `1`. If the key `i` already exists, its value is incremented by `1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d` is a dictionary.
   - `i` is the next element in the list `palka`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is about to start a new iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list `palka`.
   - The dictionary `d` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next element in the list `palka`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`d` is a dictionary, `i` is the next element in the list `palka`**
