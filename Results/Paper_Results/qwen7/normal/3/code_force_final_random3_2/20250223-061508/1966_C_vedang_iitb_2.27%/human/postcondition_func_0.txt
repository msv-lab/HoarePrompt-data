The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of non-negative integers and returns a new list `a_new`. Each element `a_new[i]` (for i starting from 1) is decremented by the sum of all preceding elements in `a` up to `a[i-1]`. After the function executes, `a_new` contains the updated values, while `a` retains its initial values but is modified according to the loop's effect. The variable `i` equals the length of `a_new`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements.
