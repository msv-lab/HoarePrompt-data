Output State: **The program returns 2**

Given the initial state, `winNext` is the result of calling `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. The problem statement specifies that `winNext` is neither 2 nor 1 with `a[0]` being 1, or the value of `winNext` is 1 with `a[0]` being 1. However, the return statement simply returns 2 regardless of the value of `winNext`. Therefore, the program returns 2.
