Output State: **q is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, w is the square root of q, and M is an empty list.**

The code calculates the square root of `q` and assigns it to the variable `w`. Since `q` is an integer, `w` will be its square root. The values of `x` and `M` remain unchanged.
