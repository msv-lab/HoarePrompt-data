Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `q` and `x`, and returns a list of divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` along with their corresponding quotients when divided into `q`.
   - The logic in the function is correct. It first checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds the square root to the list `M`.
   - Then, it iterates through all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `q` (exclusive). For each divisor found, it checks if the divisor or its quotient is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and adds them to the list `M`.

2. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is even. If not, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
   - If `y` is even, it calls `func_1` with `(y - 2) // 2` and `x` to get a list of possible values for `k`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2` and adds the results of another call to `func_1` with `((n - x) // 2)` and `x` to the list.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the unique elements in the list `L1`.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that `1 <= x < q <= 10^9` and `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.
   - The function `func_1` handles these constraints correctly by finding all divisors of `q` that meet the criteria.
   - The main program correctly processes each test case and ensures that the final result is the number of valid `k` values.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
