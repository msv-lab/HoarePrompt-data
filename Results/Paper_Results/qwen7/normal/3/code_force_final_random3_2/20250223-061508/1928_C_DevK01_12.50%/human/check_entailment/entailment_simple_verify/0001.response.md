### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`.

#### Condition Check:
- The program checks if `y = n + x` is even. If it is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the settling pattern requires an even number of positions to complete one full cycle.

#### Function Call:
- The program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` which calculates possible values of `k` for the first part of the settling pattern.
- If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it also calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` for the second part of the settling pattern.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function calculates possible values of `k` using a mathematical approach.
- It first checks if `q` (which is `(y - 2) // 2` or `(n - x) // 2`) is a perfect square.
- Then it iterates through all divisors of `q` and adds those divisors to the list `M` if they are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

#### Output:
- The program prints the length of the unique values in `L1` after processing both parts of the settling pattern.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - Correctly handles the input and processes each test case.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - Correctly checks if `y` is even and prints `0` if it is odd.

3. **Function Call:**
   - Calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments to find possible values of `k`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function aims to find divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - However, there are some issues with the logic:
     - The function only considers divisors of `q` that are perfect squares or divisors themselves.
     - It does not consider the full range of possible `k` values as described in the problem statement.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the unique values in `L1`, but `L1` might not contain all possible `k` values.

### Example Analysis:

Let's take the example provided:
- Test case: `n = 10`, `x = 2`
- `y = n + x = 12`, which is even.
- `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x) = func_1(5, 2)`:
  - `q = 5` is not a perfect square, so no divisors are added.
- `func_1((n - x) // 2, x) = func_1(4, 2)`:
  - `q = 4` is a perfect square, so `M = [2]`.
- `L1 = [2]`, and the length is `1`.

However, the correct `k` values should be `2, 3, 5, 6`, which are not captured by the current logic.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly identify all possible values of `k`. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not cover all cases as described in the problem statement.

**Final: False**
