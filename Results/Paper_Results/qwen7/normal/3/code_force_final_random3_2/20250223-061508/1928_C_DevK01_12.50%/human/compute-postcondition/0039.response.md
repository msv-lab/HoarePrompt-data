Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, where `q` is an integer representing Vasya's position in the line, and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling. Both `q` and `x` satisfy 1 <= x < q <= 10^9. The function calculates and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotients when divided into `q`.**
