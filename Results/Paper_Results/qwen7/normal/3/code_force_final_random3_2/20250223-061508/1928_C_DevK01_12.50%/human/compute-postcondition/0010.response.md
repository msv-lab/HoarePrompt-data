Output State: **`q` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be an integer and `w >= x - 1`, `M` is a list containing `[w, i]`, `i` is 1 and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `q`, and the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Since `i` is currently 1 and meets the conditions specified (a divisor of `q` and greater than or equal to `x - 1`), the list `M` now contains both `w` and `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
