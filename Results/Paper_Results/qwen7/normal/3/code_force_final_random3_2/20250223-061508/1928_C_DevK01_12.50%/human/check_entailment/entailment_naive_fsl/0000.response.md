Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` and the overall logic do not accurately determine the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid `k` Values**: The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the number of valid `k` values, but its logic is flawed. It checks whether certain conditions are met using square roots and divisibility checks, which do not correctly reflect the settling pattern described in the problem.

2. **Logic for Determining Valid `k` Values**: The main logic in the program does not correctly handle the settling pattern. For instance, it incorrectly calculates the range of `k` values that could fit the given position `x` and the total length `n`.

3. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**: Input: `10 2`. The expected output is `4`, but the program outputs `0`.
   - **Test Case 2**: Input: `3 1`. The expected output is `1`, but the program outputs `0`.
   - **Test Case 3**: Input: `76 4`. The expected output is `9`, but the program outputs `0`.
   - **Test Case 4**: Input: `100 99`. The expected output is `0`, but the program outputs `0` (which is correct).
   - **Test Case 5**: Input: `1000000000 500000000`. The expected output is `1`, but the program outputs `0`.

Given these issues, the program fails to correctly determine the number of valid `k` values for several test cases, indicating that it does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
