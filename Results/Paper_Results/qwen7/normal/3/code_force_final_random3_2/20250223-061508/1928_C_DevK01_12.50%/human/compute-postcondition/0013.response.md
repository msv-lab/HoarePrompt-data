Postcondition: `q` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be an integer and `w >= x - 1`, `M` is a list containing `[w, i]` where `i` is 1 and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `q`, and the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
